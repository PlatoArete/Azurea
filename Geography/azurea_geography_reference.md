# Azurea: Geography Reference Document

## Overview

This document compiles the complete geography of the known world of Azurea, including the main landmass (the Empire), island nations, undersea settlements, and the Underworld. The setting is in a post-apocalyptic state following "the Passing"—an eldritch catastrophe that devastated civilization.

# Part One: The Shape of the World

## Global Geography

The known world consists of:

| Region                  | Description                                                                                                    |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **The Main Landmass**   | A large continent dominated by the Empire, roughly equivalent in scale to the Roman Empire plus Eastern Europe |
| **Shiranui**            | An archipelago to the east, never conquered by the Empire                                                      |
| **Tyrlóng**             | A southern island city of advanced technology                                                                  |
| **Ynys Wyllt**          | A western island of raiders and old traditions                                                                 |
| **The Shallow Sea**     | Southern waters between the mainland and Tyrlóng                                                               |
| **The Eastern Islands** | Contested archipelago between the Empire and Shiranui                                                          |
| **The Undersea Realms** | Vertical civilization from surface to abyss                                                                    |
| **The Underworld**      | Dwarven cities and the realm of Ostara below the surface                                                       |

## The Surrounding Oceans

| Ocean                     | Direction | Character                                                             |
| ------------------------- | --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **The Ice Ocean**         | North     | Frozen, largely impassable; Urkhani tell of star-roads across the ice |
| **The Vast Ocean (West)** | West      | Beyond Ynys Wyllt; the Hawthorne is said to be visible at the horizon |
| **The Vast Ocean (East)** | East      | Beyond Shiranui; sailors report strange islands and wrong stars       |
| **The Deep Ocean**        | South     | Beyond Tyrlóng; the Ti-Abzu sense something in the trenches           |

## The Lands Beyond

Beyond the known oceans lie the **Lands Beyond**—places spoken of in legend but never mapped:

- **Útheim** ("The Outer Home") — Where the Nordri claim to have originated
- The lands beyond the eastern ocean where Shiranui sailors report impossible things
- Wherever the Hawthorne truly is—and what lies beyond it

These remain deliberately undefined. The mystery is intentional.

# Part Two: The Main Landmass (The Empire)

## Climate Zones

| Region            | Climate   | Character                                           |
| ----------------- | --------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **The North**     | Cold      | Mountains, fjords, pine forests, long winters       |
| **The Heartland** | Temperate | The best arable lands, deep forests, fertile plains |
| **The South**     | Hot       | River valleys, oases, arid uplands                  |
| **The West**      | Mixed     | Great forests (the Kingswood), old heartlands       |
| **The East**      | Coastal   | Islands, trading ports, contact with Shiranui       |

## The Altheim Plateau and Twin Capitals

The heart of Imperial power sits on a raised tableland called the **Altheim Plateau** (or **Corona Mundi**—Crown of the World):

- Flat tops and dramatic cliffs
- Multiple rivers originate here
- Cooler and drier than surrounding lowlands
- Whoever holds the heights controls the water

### The Mere of Crowns (Lacus Coronarum)

A long, narrow body of water between the two capitals:

- Fed by streams from the plateau heights
- Drains via rivers to each capital
- Sacred to multiple traditions
- Legends speak of something sleeping beneath
- The water is unnaturally clear and cold
- Boats cross regularly between the two cities

---

## The Twin Capitals

### Vandgwyn — The White City (Spiritual Capital)

**Location:** At the lower end of the Altheim Plateau, where two rivers converge.

**The Rivers:**
- **The Solwynn** (Sun-River) — Flows from the east, catches morning light
- **The Lunwynn** (Moon-River) — Flows from the west, silver in evening
- Both originate at the Mere of Crowns
- They meet at Vandgwyn in a dramatic confluence

**The Four Quarters:**

| Quarter                   | Location                                     | Character                                                           |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **The Celestial Quarter** | Northeast (between rivers before confluence) | The Cathedral of First Light, Papal Palace, seminary, holy archives |
| **The Merchant Quarter**  | Southeast                                    | Trade from the Solwynn, markets, guildhalls, banking houses         |
| **The Commons Quarter**   | Southwest                                    | Working people, artisans, older buildings, narrower streets         |
| **The Noble Quarter**     | Northwest                                    | Aristocratic palaces, Imperial Embassy, gardens along the Lunwynn   |

**The Isle of Sending:** Where the rivers meet stands an island—the center of spiritual power. Here lie the Cathedral's crypts, the Founder's Tomb, and the original church. Now restricted and mysterious.

**Post-Passing State:**
- The Luminary (Aldric VII) is mad and sealed in the Sanctum
- The Hierarchy rules through forged pronouncements
- Schismatic factions contend for control
- The Isle of Sending is rumored to be *wrong* somehow

---

### Aurheim — The Crowned City (Secular Capital)

**Location:** At the upper end of the Altheim Plateau, flanked by two rivers.

**The Rivers:**
- **The Reginwynn** (King's River) — Flows east, curves south, passes Aurheim's eastern side
- **The Dominwynn** (Lord's River) — Flows west, curves south, passes Aurheim's western side
- The city sits in the "V" where they come closest

**City Structure:**

| Zone           | Character                                                                                   |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **The Crown**  | Central citadel; the Imperial Palace sits atop a sleeping giant's skull (officially denied) |
| **The Ring**   | Circular walls containing government, military, courts                                      |
| **The Spokes** | Districts radiating outward: noble houses, guilds, temples                                  |
| **The Fields** | Agricultural land outside the walls, watered by the two rivers                              |

**The Giant Beneath:** The city is built on a sleeping giant. Signs since the Passing: cracks in old stones, servants who hear whispered breathing.

**Post-Passing State:**
- The Emperor is dead or missing
- Factions claim regency
- The giant beneath may be stirring

**Travel Between Capitals:**
- The Mere of Crowns (boat travel, half a day)
- The High Road along the Mere's western shore (overland, one day)
- The **Via Solis** (Sun Road) connects them—the most important route in the Empire

---

## Regional Centers

### The Heartland

The agricultural heart of the Empire—flat, fertile, crisscrossed by rivers and canals.

#### Grannaria — The Granary City

**Location:** Where the Heartland's three major rivers converge.

**Role:** The Empire's bread-basket hub.

**Character:**
- Massive stone granaries along the riverfront
- Canal networks radiating outward
- Flat, practical architecture
- The great Market-Square where prices were set

**Pre-Passing:** Population 180,000. The Grain-Masters' Guild controlled continental food prices.

**Post-Passing:** Population ~40,000. Granaries one-third full. A Council of Merchants governs, having pushed aside the Imperial Governor. Militant orders circle, wanting control of the food supply.

---

#### Lexium — The City of Laws

**Location:** A day's journey east of Aurheim, on the Reginwynn River.

**Role:** The Empire's legal and academic center.

**Character:**
- Colonnaded law-courts dominating the city center
- The University of Lexium—oldest and most prestigious
- Archives of every Imperial law, contract, and precedent

**Pre-Passing:** Population 120,000. Home to the Supreme Tribunal.

**Post-Passing:** Population ~70,000. The University remains open. The Chancellor has become de facto ruler. A haven for those fleeing the Scouring.

---

#### Castellum Pontem — Bridge-Fort

**Location:** Where the Via Solis crosses the Mere of Crowns at its narrowest point.

**Role:** The strategic chokepoint between Vandgwyn and Aurheim.

**Character:**
- A fortress-town built around the Great Bridge
- The bridge is a quarter-mile span, wide enough for four wagons

**Pre-Passing:** Population 25,000. Heavy military garrison.

**Post-Passing:** Population ~15,000. The bridge commander (Marcella Ironhand) has declared effective independence, charging tolls to everyone.

---

#### Anomalous Site: The Unnamed Battlefield

**Location:** In the wildlands between the Heartland and the West.

**Character:** A valley filled with bones and war-markers, but *no memory* of who fought there.
-   Records are blank.
-   Visitors feel intense, undefined grief.
-   **Significance:** Believed to be a manifestation of the **Abyss** or a **Null Field** emergence—a place where history was erased.

---

### The North

Cold, mountainous, independent-minded. The Church's grip was always weaker here.

#### Nordgard — The North-Watch

**Location:** Northern end of the Via Montana, where the road meets the Axis Mountains.

**Role:** Gateway to the north; trade hub between Imperial and Axis Faith cultures.

**Character:**
- Heavy stone walls against winter wind
- Great halls with dwarven heating technology
- Mixed Imperial and Axis Faith architecture
- A frontier feeling

**Pre-Passing:** Population 45,000. Half human, half dwarven.

**Post-Passing:** Population ~30,000. Dwarves mostly retreated. Duke Bjorn Wolf-Friend maintains ties with Thrymheim.

---

#### Skyhallow (Himmelheim) — RUINED

**Location:** A plateau high in the Axis Mountains.

**Role:** Holiest site of the Axis Faith—where Delvers and Surveyors met to worship.

**Character:**
- Half underground (Delver construction)
- Half in clouds (Surveyor construction)—silk spires, cloud-bridges, wind-catchers
- The Meeting Temple at the junction

**Pre-Passing:** Population 35,000 (variable with pilgrims). The most beautiful synthesis of Above and Below.

**Post-Passing:** Population unknown (possibly 5,000, possibly none). The Surveyor half is destroyed. Cloud-cities fell. Traumatized Aetherwings wander the ruins.

---

#### Fjordhavn — Fjord-Haven

**Location:** Mouth of the largest northern fjord, where the Ice Ocean meets habitable land.

**Role:** The Empire's northernmost port.

**Character:**
- Wooden buildings (stone doesn't survive frost-heaves)
- Natural harbor sheltered by fjord walls
- Shipyards for northern waters

**Pre-Passing:** Population 20,000. Fishing, whaling, occasional Wylltic raiders.

**Post-Passing:** Population ~12,000. Admiral Tova Storm-Singer runs the town. She's made peace with local Wylltic raiders. Strange things reported in northern waters.

---

### The South

Hot, ancient, dominated by Dragon-kin but with significant human populations.

#### Khaldera — The River-Crown

**Location:** Where the Great Southern River (Vitaflum) branches into its delta.

**Role:** Human capital of the southern provinces.

**Character:**
- Ancient—older than the Empire
- Mudbrick and limestone, whitewashed against sun
- Irrigation canals threading through
- Temples to many traditions

**Pre-Passing:** Population 200,000. Cosmopolitan trading hub.

**Post-Passing:** Population ~90,000. Dragon-kin have withdrawn. Old traditions reviving.

---

#### Zircon — The Jewel-City

**Location:** Hills above Khaldera, where precious stones are mined.

**Role:** The Empire's gem-trade center.

**Character:**
- Terraced into hillside, white buildings with inlaid stones
- The Gem-Cutters' Guild
- Cool elevation above delta heat

**Pre-Passing:** Population 35,000. Sapphires, rubies, emeralds for Imperial treasuries.

**Post-Passing:** Population ~25,000. Pivoting to magical technology (crystal-tech research). Potential rival to Tyrlóng.

---

### The West

The old heartlands around and beyond the Kingswood. Celtic-influenced, older traditions persistent.

#### The Kingswood (Coillrí)

Hundreds of miles of ancient growth forest. Home to Forest Elves, Fae courts, and human communities that never fully converted.

**Character:**
- The Church claimed jurisdiction; the forest disagreed
- Underworld access points in the deepest groves
- Celtic-influenced traditions (Geal-sí and Dorcha-sí)
- The Fae are *present* here

**Post-Passing:** The forest *closed*. Paths that worked for centuries now lead in circles. The Fae are deciding what to do—about humanity's failure and their own.

---

#### Caerderw — The Forest Capital

**Imperial Name:** Quercum Castrum
**Common Name:** Oakhold

**Location:** On a Fae Age hill fort in the heart of the Kingswood.

**Character:**
- Built on earthworks old before humans arrived (Fae construction, no iron)
- Streets follow spiral patterns of original earthworks
- Cathedral at summit built *around* a standing stone
- The "Devil's Door" here is famous—and *open*
- Forest grows through the walls
- Ruled by a Duke whose real power comes from... other arrangements

**The River System:**
- **The Coillwynn** (Forest-River) — Main river, flows from northern highlands through Caerderw to the coast
- **The Derwyn** (Oak-River) — Runs parallel, west of Coillwynn
- **The Cenwyn** (Ancient-River) — Runs parallel, east of Coillwynn

---

#### Coedporth (Portus Silvarum) — Forest-Port

**Location:** Where the Coillwynn River meets the western sea.

**Role:** The Kingswood's connection to maritime trade.

**Character:**
- Half port-town, half forest-town
- Wooden wharves, tidal harbor
- Shipyards building vessels from Kingswood timber

**Pre-Passing:** Population 40,000.

**Post-Passing:** Population ~20,000. The forest has closed—timber harvests stopped. Population split between sea-folk and forest-folk.

---

#### Dun Mara — Sea-Fort

**Location:** Headland commanding western approaches, north of Kingswood coast.

**Role:** Naval fortress protecting against Wylltic raiders.

**Character:**
- Massive stone walls, seaward towers
- Signal towers along coast
- The Shield of the West

**Pre-Passing:** Population 15,000. The Western Fleet (forty warships).

**Post-Passing:** Population ~8,000. Fleet reduced to twelve ships. Admiral Caius Blackwater commands. Raiders have stopped raiding—that's almost worse. Scouts sent toward Ynys Wyllt haven't returned.

---

### The East

The coast facing Shiranui. Trading ports, elf-influenced, cosmopolitan.

#### Portus Aureus — Golden-Port

**Location:** Eastern coast, nearest major port to Shiranui.

**Role:** The Empire's gateway to the east.

**Character:**
- Crescent harbor with breakwaters
- Warehouses from a dozen trading nations
- Tower of Translation for multilingual negotiation
- Consulate Row with diplomatic missions

**Pre-Passing:** Population 150,000. The richest port in the Empire.

**Post-Passing:** Population ~60,000. Trade with Shiranui slowed but not stopped. Council of Captains rules. Refugees cluster hoping for passage east.

---

#### Aurhalion — The Imperial Elf City

**Meaning:** "Golden Hall of Light"

**Location:** Eastern heartland or coast—an important sub-capital of the Empire.

**Character:**
- Ancient Goleuwyr architecture: towers designed to catch light, crystalline windows, solar geometry
- Solarian cathedrals rising among elven spires
- Majority Goleuwyr population with substantial human presence
- The Hidden faction dominates—keep quiet, survive, wait

**Famous Features:**
- The Library of Dawn (ancient texts the Church doesn't know exist)
- The Mirror Palace (sun reflected through at specific times)
- The Festival of First Light (officially Solarian, actually older)

---

#### Thalaurion — The Distant Elf City

**Meaning:** "Far Golden Place"

**Location:** Off the eastern coast on its own peninsula, like ancient Tyre. Close enough for Imperial tribute but defensible.

**Character:**
- Pure Goleuwyr design, no Solarian additions
- Crystalline spires catching and multiplying light
- Buildings oriented to track sun's path
- The whole city glows at dawn, dusk, and through the night

**The Sunhold Technology:**
- Crystals absorb Light-field energy during day, release slowly at night
- The **Heliophora** (Sun-Bearers) — massive crystal arrays on highest towers
- The **Aureolis** (Golden One) — largest, atop Temple of Unconquered Sun
- The city never goes dark

**Post-Passing:**
- Closed to outsiders (quarantine)
- Some crystals cracked or clouded
- Debating whether to ever reopen

## Roads, Canals, and Travel

### The Imperial Roads

Built during bloody expansion, maintained (barely) since.

| Road               | Route                                | Current State                          |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| **Via Solis**      | Vandgwyn to Aurheim                  | Still maintained, heavily patrolled    |
| **Via Imperialis** | Aurheim to eastern coast (Aurhalion) | Deteriorating, dangerous sections      |
| **Via Meridiana**  | Heartland to Dragon-kin territories  | Maintained by Dragon-kin in south      |
| **Via Silvae**     | Heartland to Caerderw                | Increasingly overgrown                 |
| **Via Montana**    | Heartland to Axis Faith north        | Snow-blocked half year, Reft in passes |
| **Via Littoralis** | Eastern coast route                  | Fragmented, local control              |

### The Canals

The Empire was a canal-building civilization.

**Major Systems:**
- **The Mere Network** — Connecting the Mere of Crowns to both capitals
- **The Heartland Web** — Linking agricultural regions to markets
- **The Southern Irrigation** — Dragon-kin engineering, older than the Empire
- **The Eastern Branches** — Connecting coast to interior markets

**Current State:** Many functional (canals need less repair than roads), but locks breaking down, some sections blocked.

### The Reality: Most People Stay Home

Before the Passing, travel was common. Now:

**Why People Stay:**
- The Reft are everywhere outside settlements
- Bandits (desperate survivors)
- Roads unmaintained
- Nobody trusts strangers
- Local communities closed ranks
- Nowhere to go that's better

**Who Still Travels:**
- Militant orders (only groups with enough force)
- Essential traders (enormous risk)
- Refugees (staying is worse)
- Messengers (fast, alone, expendable)
- The desperate, the mad, the faithful

---

# Part Three: Island Nations

## Shiranui-no-Tōkoku — The Never-Conquered Islands

**Meaning:** "Unknown Fire of the Eastern Country"

**Common Name:** Shiranui

### Geography

- An archipelago—main island plus dozens of smaller ones
- Volcanic (the "unknown fire" references this)
- Mountainous interior, coastal rice paddies, forested hills
- Monsoon climate, typhoons, misty seasons

### Political Structure

- Ruled by a **Tennō** (Heavenly Sovereign) claiming descent from spirits
- Legitimacy confirmed by Imperial "investiture" (purely ceremonial)
- Never invaded, never Churched
- Complex hierarchy of noble families, temple networks, regional lords

### Religious Landscape

- Kōrei (bright spirits) and Anrei (dark spirits) worshipped openly
- Ostaran ancestor-veneration is cultural norm
- Kasandran communities exist without persecution
- Revnan mystery cults operate in mountain monasteries
- The Theosyn remembered with Japanese-inflected names

### Relationship to the Empire

- Paid tribute: silk, lacquerware, refined metals
- Accepted nominal Imperial suzerainty
- Never allowed Solarian missionaries beyond port cities

### Post-Passing State

- The Passing touched Shiranui *less*—but still touched them
- The plague called **Kageboushi** (Shadow-Stars): dark spots spreading like stars
- Survival rate maybe 15% better than Empire's—significant but not salvation
- More organized response: quarantine, specialized shrine-keepers
- Ritual cleansing practices (misogi, harae) accidentally reduce exposure
- Watching the Empire collapse with concern and uncertainty about their own survival

---

## Tyrlóng — The Clockwork City

### Origin and History

- Founded centuries ago by human colonists fleeing Church persecution
- Settled on island already inhabited by Dragon-kin (Tiān-Phanes house)
- Found common ground: both valued knowledge over dogma
- Dragon-kin shared alchemical secrets; humans brought fresh perspectives
- Became *de facto* center of Dragon-kin engagement with wider world

### Character

- Not the Dragon-kin capital, but like Byzantine Constantinople
- Where Dragon-kin and humans work as (relative) equals
- **Renaissance clockpunk + magic** aesthetic

### Technology

"Advanced" through application of realm-field manipulation:

- Brass orreries tracking realm-field fluctuations
- Crystal lenses revealing contamination
- Pneumatic message systems
- Alchemical streetlights (different colors indicate district status)
- Automata for contaminated zones
- Navigation instruments reading realm-fields
- Medicine far beyond mainland

**Not steam-punk—"magic industrialized"**

### Culture

- Polyglot: trade-tongue, High Draconic, Phoenician-derived local language
- Religiously tolerant
- Meritocratic in theory, oligarchic in practice
- Famous for: Great Library, Artificer's Guild, Tide-Markets, Philosopher's Spire

### Architecture

- Phoenician foundations (harbors, sea-walls)
- Dragon-kin influences (curved roofs, dragon-scale tiling, fire-vents)
- Roman-style public spaces (forums, baths, aqueducts)
- Feels both ancient and futuristic

### Post-Passing State

- Less damaged than mainland (island + Dragon-kin wards)
- **Riven by plague**—not flooded with refugees because not many survived to flee
- Quarantine districts, whole neighborhoods sealed
- The technology that was supposed to transcend Church failures now serving grim necessity
- Debate: help rebuild Empire, or let it fall?

---

## Ynys Wyllt — The Wild Isle

**Imperial Name:** Insula Ferox
**Meaning:** "The Wild Isle" / "The Fierce Island"

### Geography

- Far to the west, across difficult waters
- Mountainous interior, rocky coasts, deep fjords
- Harsh weather—storms from endless western ocean
- Dense forests in valleys, moorland on heights
- Iron-rich (unlike Fae lands—iron is sacred here)

### History

- Originally settled by humans fleeing God-Giant War (same wave as mainland)
- They went further, seeking true separation
- Some also fled Imperial expansion later
- Empire tried invasion twice; both times broken by weather, terrain, warriors
- Eventually settled into wary coexistence: raiders hit coasts, Empire burns villages, cycle repeats

### The Cultural Layers

| Layer             | Equivalent         | Character                                          |
| ----------------- | ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **The Gwerin**    | Original Brythonic | First humans, hill-forts, druidic traditions       |
| **The Rhufeinig** | Romano-British     | Settlers from early Empire, brought writing/roads  |
| **The Saesyn**    | Anglo-Saxon        | Refugees from Empire's expansion, Theosyn worship  |
| **The Nordri**    | Norse              | Arrived from "Lands Beyond," seafaring aristocracy |

**Current Mix:** Nobody is "pure" anything. Languages, customs, and traditions blend.

### Religion

- Never Churched—missionaries who landed were sacrificed
- Norse-influenced Alysian tradition (Vættir, land-wights)
- Strong Ostaran elements: ancestors fight alongside living
- Theosyn remembered as actual gods
- Some Revnan influence in völva (seer) traditions

### The Edge of the World

- Westernmost inhabited land
- Beyond it, the ocean stretches to... what?
- Sailors report the Hawthorne visible on certain nights
- None have returned from trying to pass it

### The Nordri Mystery

Where did the Nordri come from? Their sagas speak of:
- **Útheim** (The Outer Home)—a land beyond the western sea
- Ice that never melts, auroras that speak, giants truly awake
- A disaster that drove them out
- A voyage guided by stars that don't exist in this sky

They crossed waters where the Hawthorne should have stopped them. How? Unknown. Deliberately undefined.

### Post-Passing State

- Hit hard—old gods didn't save them either
- Some islands simply *gone* (Katiari's touch?)
- Raiders have stopped raiding—too busy surviving
- Not asking for help (pride, or knowledge Empire has nothing to offer)
- Some turning to darker traditions, blood-magic the völva once forbade

---

## The Eastern Islands — The Contested Zone

Between the Empire's eastern coast and Shiranui's western islands.

### Nature

- Hundreds of islands (tiny rocks to substantial landmasses)
- Volcanic (same system as Shiranui)
- Rich in fish, some with fresh water, few with arable land
- Strategically vital for east-west trade

### Politics

- Some pay tribute to Empire
- Some pay tribute to Shiranui
- Some pay both (playing them against each other)
- Some are pirate havens
- Some change hands every generation

### Notable Trading Posts

| Name              | Alignment        | Character                                                   |
| ----------------- | ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Portus Medius** | Imperial-leaning | Largest, most "civilized," barely-tolerated Church presence |
| **Aoshima**       | Shiranui-aligned | Elegant, temple-dotted, strictly regulated                  |
| **Freeport**      | Neutral/Pirate   | Anything goes, anyone welcome                               |
| **The Crossing**  | Contested        | Changes hands regularly                                     |

### Peoples

A mix of everyone: Imperial humans, Shiranui islanders, Dragon-kin traders, Atargatan peoples, pirates from Ynys Wyllt, occasional Goleuwyr merchants. Own creole culture—bits of every tradition, loyal to none.

# Part Four: The Shallow Sea and Ocean Geography

## The Mare Internum (The Shallow Sea)

Southern waters bounded by:
- Empire's southern coast (river deltas, Dragon-kin territories)
- Tyrlóng's island
- Dragon-kin homeland (southern mainland)

### Tyrlóng's Undersea Shelf

- Tyrlóng sits on a shallow shelf that was once land
- In ancient times, walkable from mainland
- Now underwater but barely—visible at low tide
- Ti-Abzu and Kur-Datsu live in deeper parts
- Shio-Gatis perfectly adapted to this threshold zone

### The Thermocline Temples

- Built at edge of shelf, where shallow meets deep
- Half the year accessible by diving
- Where Surface-Kin and Deep-Kin meet to negotiate

---

# Part Five: Undersea Settlements

The Atargatan peoples exist in vertical civilization—from surface to abyss.

## Surface Settlements (The Shimmering)

### Coral-Crown (Oktapólis)

**Location:** Vast coral reef system in the Shallow Sea.

**Inhabitants:** Primarily Abgal-Tako (cephalopod sages), plus Shio-Gatis.

**Character:**
- Coral towers rising from reef
- Eight-fold symmetry (honoring Abgal-Tako form)
- "Roads" are water-channels navigated by swimming
- Air-chambers for surface visitors
- The Great Ink-Library: knowledge in squid-ink on shell-pages

**Functions:**
- Diplomacy hub
- Information exchange
- Trade nexus
- Navigation center

**Post-Passing:** Coral stressed, Wrong Rain contamination, debating retreat. Recently, divers report "dark fibrous growth" (The Ivy) choking the deeper reefs—structure dissolving into pre-creation sludge.

---

### Tidewalker's Rest (Shimohama)

**Location:** Coastal region with extreme tides creating vast intertidal zones.

**Inhabitants:** Shio-Gatis (tide-changed)—aquatic at high tide, terrestrial at low.

**Character:**
- Structures designed for underwater AND above water
- Homes that seal at high tide, open at low
- Gardens growing both kelp and vegetables
- Twice-daily transformation of landscape

**Functions:**
- Boundary-keeping
- Translation between surface and sea
- Tide-Markets at turning of each tide
- Sanctuary

**Philosophy:** "The boundary is reality."

**Post-Passing:** Some Shio-Gatis stranded in one form.

---

## Transitional Settlements (The Thermocline)

### The Breathing Temple (Pneuma Thalassa)

**Location:** Edge of undersea shelf near Tyrlóng.

**Nature:** A temple that literally breathes—rising and falling with pressure.

**Character:**
- Pressure-resistant materials (deep coral, volcanic glass)
- Air-chambers that compress/expand with depth changes
- The "Breath"—temple rises at certain tides, falls at others
- Meeting halls where Surface and Deep Kin can both survive

**Functions:**
- Primary Atargatan temple complex
- Where Shimmering and Abiding meet
- Thermocline Crossing rituals
- Major purification ceremonies

**Post-Passing:** Rhythm off, chambers flooding unexpectedly, Deep Kin sensing wrongness below.

---

### Vent-Home (Apsu-Gar)

**Location:** Around hydrothermal vents in deep ocean, south of Tyrlóng.

**Inhabitants:** Ti-Abzu (ancient depth-dwellers).

**Character:**
- Structures grown from vent-minerals over millennia
- Bioluminescent lighting
- No sense of "up" or "down"
- Time moves differently—Ti-Abzu think in centuries

**Functions:**
- Listening to Earth's heartbeat through vents
- Memory (they remember things surface has forgotten)
- Prophecy (vent-patterns sometimes speak of future)
- The Deep Council

**The Ti-Abzu:** Massive, slow, ancient. Some thousands of years old. Perceive "spirit-currents."

**Post-Passing:** Sensed Passing as "wrongness in currents," sent warnings nobody understood. Now sensing contamination spreading downward.

---

## Deep Settlements (The Abiding)

### The Crushing Sanctuary (Nisiqtu-Gar)

**Location:** Deep trenches where pressure would kill surface creatures.

**Inhabitants:** Kur-Datsu (pressure-changed)—descendants of surface-dwellers who descended and adapted.

**Character:**
- Carved into trench walls
- Dense, compressed architecture
- "Sun-Altars" in every home (representations of lost light)
- Society built on sacrifice and transformation

**The Kur-Datsu:** Flattened, dense, adapted to crushing pressure. Can rise to thermocline but never to surface.

**Philosophy:** "The Stripping"—pressure removes the false; truth survives.

**Post-Passing:** Noticed things moving in deepest trenches. Sealed some passages leading down. Won't speak of what they saw.

---

### Apsu-Kur (The Abyss-Below-the-Abyss)

Below even the Kur-Datsu settlements. The Ti-Abzu name for it. May connect to Katiari's realm. May connect to something worse.

Since the Passing, sounds come from Apsu-Kur. The Kur-Datsu pretend not to hear them.

## River Peoples: The En-He-Dao

The En-He-Dao (Way-of-Water Folk) don't have single cities—they have the rivers themselves.

### The Journey-Towns

| Type                | Character                                    | Names                             |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **Mountain-Source** | Cold, pure, pilgrimage sites                 | Fonthead, Springborn, Clearrise   |
| **Valley-Flow**     | Trading posts, meeting places                | Broadwater, Tradeflow, Meetstream |
| **Delta-End**       | Large, cosmopolitan, spiritually significant | Saltmouth, Endflow, Seareach      |

**Philosophy:** "The river is the sea's becoming."

**Post-Passing:** Some rivers contaminated. Some have inexplicably *stopped*.

---

# Part Six: The Underworld

## The Threshold

Dwarven peoples recognize a boundary between:
- The "living" underground (Gwenaelle's domain)
- The "deathly" underground (Ostara's domain)

The Delvers generally stay above the Threshold; the Eald-Delfen move freely through it.

---

## Delver Cities (Axis Faith)

Beneath the northern mountains. Industrial, spiritual, and commercial centers.

### Thrymheim — The Hammer-Home

**Capital of the Korvathrim (Forge-Masters)**

**Location:** Beneath **Thrymspire**, the highest peak of the Axis range.

**Scale:**
- Seven major levels descending into mountain
- Miles of halls at each level
- Population: ~200,000 dwarves, plus thousands of traders

**The Levels:**

| Level       | Name                | Function                                          |
| ----------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 (Highest) | The Emergence       | Surface access, markets, Marketplace-Temple       |
| 2           | The Guildhalls      | Master craftsmen, academies                       |
| 3           | The Living Quarters | Homes, communal spaces, ale-halls                 |
| 4           | The Foundries       | Primary forges, the Great Furnace                 |
| 5           | The Refineries      | Ore processing, smelting                          |
| 6           | The Deeps           | Mining operations, Mukir territory                |
| 7 (Lowest)  | The Roots           | Deep veins, geothermal vents, Kobalthari chambers |

**The Great Furnace:** Forge-fire fed by volcanic vents. Believed to connect to Dragons' Deep Fire. Has never gone out.

**The Grand Entrance (The Hammer-Mouth):**
- Road carved into mountainside, wide enough for wagon-trains
- Switchbacks climbing two thousand feet
- Gate: fifty feet high, thirty wide
- **The Hammer-Pillars:** Two massive columns carved as hammers
- **The Anvil-Threshold:** Single slab of iron-veined stone
- **The Forge-Relief:** Carved scene of Great Furnace with gold/copper inlay
- **The Words:** *"What enters rough, leaves refined. What enters cold, leaves forged. What enters alone, leaves bound to the stone."*
- **The Awe-Hall** beyond: ceiling lost in shadow, pillars wider than houses, distant red glow of furnace

**Post-Passing:** Surface trade collapsed. The Aurora flickered during Passing. Some tunnels sealed after things came through.

---

### Keldheim — The Wellspring-Home

**Capital of the Mukir (Contract-Keepers)**

**Location:** Beneath hot springs region, atop geothermal source.

**Character:** Extraction and negotiation. The Mukir believe they borrow from stone—they pay rent, perform gratitude rituals.

**Layout:** Less vertical, more sprawling:
- Horizontal tunnels following ore veins
- Hot-spring chambers
- **The Contract Hall** where agreements recorded in stone
- **The Debt Ledgers**—vast walls inscribed with what is owed

**The Grand Entrance (The Wellspring-Arch):**
- Path through steaming pools and vents
- Stone causeways over boiling mud
- Bathhouses along route
- Gate shaped like cave formed by flowing water
- **The Flow-Pillars:** Carved to look like frozen waterfalls
- **The Contract-Arch:** Inscribed with First Contract
- **The Rent-Slot:** Where offerings deposited
- **The Words:** *"We borrow. We return. The mountain lends. We honor the debt."*

**Post-Passing:** Felt Passing as breach of contract. Angry and determined to find who violated cosmic agreements.

---

### Kobalthall — The Blue Chamber

**Capital of the Kobalthari (Cobalt-Wardens)**

**Location:** Beneath **Bluehorn** mountain, famous for cobalt veins.

**Character:** Interpreters—they read ore veins as books. Cobalt is sacred, conducts spiritual power.

**The Blue:** City glows with cobalt light. Metal worked into everything. Kobalthari have blue-tinged skin.

**Functions:**
- Reading mountain's "message" in ore patterns
- Creating cobalt-infused spiritual items
- Mapping connections between surface and deep
- Maintaining the **Rune-Network**

**The Grand Entrance (The Blue Mouth):**
- Winding path through blue-tinged scree
- No road—the Kobalthari prefer visitors who make effort
- Path glows faintly at night
- **The Cobalt Frame:** Gate lined with glowing worked cobalt
- **The Rune-Border:** Inscribed symbols that shift and change
- **The Question-Stone:** Touch before entry—it reads you
- **The Words:** *"Truth runs in veins. The mountain knows. Do you?"*
- **The Reading Chamber** beyond: ore-pattern maps, soft blue light revealing hidden things

**Post-Passing:** *Saw something* during Passing. Cobalt veins showed terrible patterns. Haven't shared what they learned.

---

## Eald-Delfen Cities (The True Underworld)

Deeper—where Ostara's realm touches physical world. The veil is thin. Dead walk beside living.

### Bānhāma — The Bone-Home

**The Great Ancestor City**

**Location:** Beneath southern desert, accessed through oasis cave-systems.

**Nature:** Not just a city—a library. Every chamber contains housed ancestors.

**Character:**
- Ceramic columns inscribed with lineage records
- Bone-mosaics depicting ancestor stories
- Stone niches holding thousands of "housed" spirits
- Speaking chambers where living consult dead
- **The Great Archive** where oldest ancestors reside (beings who remember God-Giant War)

**Atmosphere:** Not grim, not haunted—*warm*. The dead are home.

**The Entrance:** In the desert, an oasis called **Sleeper's Rest**. Cave behind largest date palm. Goes fifty feet to dead end. Except twice a year, at equinoxes, when setting sun hits it at precise angle—the stone isn't there anymore.

**Post-Passing:** Ancestors sensed Passing—*"This was not from outside. This was from within. Something that was always here, sleeping. It woke. Or it was woken."* Some ancestors have gone silent.

---

### Gāstweg — The Spirit-Road

**The Psychopomp Crossroads**

**Location:** Beneath northern mountains, where Underworld comes closest to surface.

**Nature:** Hub where spirit-roads converge, where newly dead are sorted and guided.

**The Crossroads:**
- **The High Road:** To Ostara's peaceful realm
- **The Returning Path:** For those becoming "housed" ancestors
- **The Healing Halls:** For confused or damaged spirits
- **The Surface Gates:** Access to living world
- **The Sealed Passage:** Leading somewhere else. The Gāstberend don't speak of it.

**The Cobalt Marks:** Gāstberend mark themselves with cobalt to amplify spirit-sight.

**The Entrance:** In the northern mountains, a glacier with a crack. Cave leads to darkness. Walk in *with* light—find more cave. Walk in *without* light, trusting—find the Spirit-Road.

**Post-Passing:** Overwhelmed. Too many dead, too fast. Spirit-roads clogged. Some souls arriving *wrong*. The Reft don't produce ghosts. Where are those souls going?

---

### Rotmunð — The Decay-Mouth

**The Cleanser City**

**Location:** Deep beneath Kingswood, where forest roots touch Underworld.

**Inhabitants:** Rot-Wendan (Decay-Turners)—fungal people who consume spiritual corruption.

**Character:**
- Organic, fungal, grown rather than built
- Mycelium walls that pulse with slow life
- Spore-chambers where cleansing happens
- **The Blooming Hall** for major purifications
- **The Whole-Mind** where collective consciousness meets

**The Entrance:** In the Kingswood, a grove where trees grow in perfect spiral. At center, hollow oak large enough to walk inside. Inside is larger than outside. Stairs go down. You don't find it—it finds you.

**Post-Passing:** *Gorging*. So much corruption that they're at capacity. Expanding, budding new colonies. Some Rot-Wendan have consumed too much—they're changing.

---

**Trade and Exchange:**
- Korvathrim forge-work goes south; Eald-Delfen ancestor-knowledge comes north
- Kobalthari cobalt supplies the Gāstberend
- Rot-Wendan cleanse items Delvers accidentally corrupt
- All parties maintain the **Stone-Peace**—a treaty older than the Empire

---

# Part Seven: The Dragon-kin Homeland

## Location and Character

The southern mainland, old and "consistent" (some would say stale). Cities that dwarf human settlements in size but not density.

**Why So Sparse?**
- Dragon-kin are large
- They're long-lived; don't reproduce quickly
- They value *space*—room to think, fly, conduct rituals
- Density feels wrong to them

## The Major Cities

### Nāgarat — City of the Serpent-Kings

**The Mush-Nāga Capital**

- Dominated by ziggurats reaching toward Deep Fire below
- Population: ~50,000 in space that could hold 500,000 humans
- Ritual pits where Sleeping Ones can be heard
- Oldest continuously inhabited city in the world

---

### Lóngyuán — Dragon-Abyss

**The Lóng-Imperiales Administrative Center**

- Vast palace complexes, military academies, record-houses
- More "active" than Nāgarat but still sparse
- The Consilium Draconis meets here

---

### Tiānmén — Heaven's Gate

**The Tiān-Phanes Philosophical Academy**

- Libraries, observatories, alchemical laboratories
- The knowledge that built Tyrlóng originated here
- Currently debating whether Tyrlóng's plague is punishment for sharing too freely

---

## The Empty Spaces

Between cities: cultivated wilderness. Gardens the size of provinces. Rivers managed for beauty. Small villages of servants. It looks empty on maps. It's *deliberate*.

---

# Part Eight: The Reft

## What They Are

The plague isn't natural disease—it's realm-wrongness made flesh. The Passing fractured realm-field boundaries. Foreign essence seeps into bodies, displacing original souls.

## The Stages

| Stage | Name         | Character                                                     |
| ----- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1     | The Fever    | Body fights intrusion. Most recover here.                     |
| 2     | The Dimming  | Person becomes distant. Forgets names, faces, language.       |
| 3     | The Emptying | Soul displaced entirely. Body moves but nothing human inside. |
| 4     | The Filling  | Something else moves in. What remains is Reft.                |

## Names Across Cultures

| Culture     | Name              | Meaning               |
| ----------- | ----------------- | --------------------- |
| Imperial    | Vastati           | The bereft ones       |
| Shiranui    | Nukegara          | Empty shells          |
| Ynys Wyllt  | Gwag / Y Colledig | Empty / The lost ones |
| Dragon-kin  | Kōng-Qū           | Hollow-driven         |
| The Church  | The Forsaken      | Abandoned by God      |
| Goleuwyr    | Gwagolion         | The emptied           |
| Eald-Delfen | Sāwollēas         | Soul-less             |

## Types of Reft (By Field)

| Field              | Type         | Behavior                               | Appearance                                 |
| ------------------ | ------------ | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Light (Bronwyn)    | Burning Reft | Drawn to light, eyes sear              | Skin cracked with inner radiance           |
| Dark (Revna)       | Shadow Reft  | Hides, ambushes, fears light           | Features blurred, hard to see directly     |
| Life (Kasandra)    | Growing Reft | Mindlessly fertile, spreads corruption | Overgrown with plant matter, fungal blooms |
| Death (Ostara)     | Bone Reft    | Seeks the dying, drawn to grief        | Emaciated, skin tight over bones           |
| Peaks (Gwenaelle)  | Storm Reft   | Aggressive, crackling energy           | Static-charged, storm-sounds in voice      |
| Depths (Atargatis) | Drowned Reft | Slow, relentless, drowning presence    | Waterlogged, seaweed traces                |
| Land (Alys)        | Root Reft    | Territorial, won't leave their place   | Earthen tones, moss-covered                |
| Blood (Emergent)   | Hungry Reft  | Actively predatory, feeds on pain      | Wounds that don't close                    |
| Abyss (Katiari)    | Empty Reft   | Erases memory in those nearby          | Featureless, forgettable                   |

## Behavior Patterns

### The Drifters
- Wander without purpose
- Most common type

### The Sitters
- Remain motionless where they fell
- Can stay in place for days, weeks, months
- Suddenly animate when stimulus arrives
- Often most dangerous—you don't see them until close

### The Repeaters
- Mime actions from former lives
- Disturbing because they seem almost normal

### The Seekers
- Actively move toward life, warmth, light (or darkness)
- Most obviously dangerous

### The Congregators
- Start alone but gather into groups
- Groups can become quite large in abandoned places

**Nobody knows** why individual Reft behave differently.

## Distribution

| Area                      | Density                | Why                              |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Abandoned settlements     | Very high              | People died or fled; bodies rose |
| Roads between settlements | High                   | Travelers died                   |
| Wilderness                | Moderate               | Fewer people to become Reft      |
| Active farmland           | Low to moderate        | Farmers clear them               |
| Fortified settlements     | Very low               | Walls, patrols                   |
| The Scars                 | Variable but dangerous | Concentrated wrongness           |

## The Village Defense Pattern

**Day:** Farmers in armed groups, lookouts, work close to walls, return before dusk.

**Night:** Gates barred, walls manned, torches lit, noise discipline.

**The Clearings:** Periodically, settlements must clear nearby Reft. Never permanent—more drift in.

# Part Ten: Remnants of the Schism (Giants and Dragons)

Both the Giants and Dragons withdrew or were stopped, leaving their mark on the geography.

## The Sleeping Giants

Giant avatars "slept" during the God-Giant War and became landmarks.

### Coronata (Aurheim)

Built on a giant's skull. The Imperial Palace sits atop it. Officially denied. Signs since Passing: cracks in old stones, servants hearing whispered breathing.

### Gigas Cove

Island chain where each island is different giant's body part (fist, knee, shoulder). Sailors navigate by them; nobody lives there.

### The Weeping Isle

Giant's head, face-up. Rain pools in eye-sockets and overflows like tears. Said to be the giant who surrendered.
*   **Note:** This site is a hotspot for the **Blood Field**; the "tears" are sometimes red, and flagellants are drawn here.

### The Titan's Rest

Mountain range that is clearly a giant lying down. Highest peak is raised knee.

### Lágrima Lake

Perfectly circular lake—a giant's eye-socket. Water shows visions of God-Giant War.

### The Broken Jaw

Valley with two parallel ridges. Filled with standing stones that are teeth.

## The Slumbering Dragons

While the Giants became landscape, the Dragons withdrew *beneath* it.

### The Deep Fire (Nāgarat)

Beneath the capital of the Mush-Nāga, the earth is permanently warm. The Deep Fire is believed to be the exhalation of a sleeping Dragon Elder.

### Mount Ignis (Volcanic Chain)

The active volcanoes of the Shiranui and Eastern Islands are said to be "Dragon-Vents"—places where the sleeping dragons turn in their dreams. To wake them is the ultimate taboo.

# Appendix B: The Theme

## What Everyone Gets Wrong

Every faction blames someone for the Passing:

| Faction                  | Blames                          |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| Church Hierarchy         | Heretics, heathens, sin         |
| The Scouring             | Non-humans, witches             |
| Flagellants              | Themselves, humanity            |
| Theosyn Revivalists      | Church suppression of true gods |
| Folk Traditions          | Church suppression of old ways  |
| Tyrlóng Rationalists     | Insufficient knowledge          |
| The Bitter (Goleuwyr)    | Human ignorance and cruelty     |
| Shiranui Traditionalists | Imperial spiritual pollution    |
| Ynys Wyllt Seers         | The gods' inscrutability        |

## The Actual Truth

**None of them are right.**

The Passing wasn't punishment. Wasn't consequence. Wasn't earned.

Eldritch things moved through this realm. They weren't attacking. Weren't punishing. May not have noticed the world they devastated.

Cosmic indifference. Wrong place, wrong time. A deer doesn't "deserve" to be caught in a forest fire.

The traditions that help aren't the ones with best explanations—they're the ones that help people survive meaningless suffering with grace.
