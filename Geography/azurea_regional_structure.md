# Azurea: Regional Structure Reference

## Overview

The Empire is divided into five major regions (*Provinciae*), each with distinct character, climate, and cultural influences. Each region contains multiple sub-regions with their own capitals and settlement patterns.

# Region One: The Heartland (Provincia Cordis)

## Overview

The agricultural and administrative core of the Empire. The most developed, most Imperial, most thoroughly Churched territory. Centered on the Altheim Plateau where the twin capitals sit.

**Climate:** Temperate
**Linguistic Influence:** Latin/Imperial
**Religious Character:** Solarian Church dominant; folk traditions suppressed but persistent in rural areas

## Sub-Regions

### 1. The Crown Lands (Regio Coronae)

**Local Name:** The Crown

**Character:** The Altheim Plateau itself, directly administered by Emperor and Church. The seat of all Imperial power, both secular and spiritual. The Mere of Crowns connects the twin capitals.

**Capital:** Aurheim (secular) + Vandgwyn (spiritual) — the twin capitals

**Geography:**
- The raised tableland of the Altheim Plateau
- The Mere of Crowns (lake between capitals)
- Rivers: Solwynn, Lunwynn, Reginwynn, Dominwynn
- Dramatic cliffs at plateau edges
- Cooler and drier than surrounding lowlands

**City Density:** Very High — 1 major city per 50 miles, dense town network

**Major Settlements:**
- **Aurheim** — Imperial/secular capital
- **Vandgwyn** — Holy/spiritual capital
- **Castellum Pontem** — Bridge-fort controlling crossing of Mere of Crowns

**Post-Passing State:** Fractured authority. Both capitals claim legitimacy while actual power fragments. The Via Solis between them remains the most important road in the Empire.

---

### 2. The Grainmarch (Regio Frumentaria)

**Local Name:** The Breadbasket

**Character:** Flat river plains spreading from the plateau's base. Extensive canal networks. The Empire's food supply. Practical, commercial, less pious than the Crown Lands.

**Capital:** Grannaria

**Geography:**
- Convergence of Heartland's three major rivers
- Canal networks radiating like spokes
- Flat, fertile plains
- Massive granary complexes

**City Density:** High — 1 major city per 60 miles, many market towns

**Major Settlements:**
- **Grannaria** — The Granary City; food distribution hub (Pre: 180,000 / Post: ~40,000)
- Multiple market towns along canals and rivers

**Post-Passing State:** Critical importance. Whoever controls Grannaria controls food supply for hundreds of miles. Council of Merchants currently holds power. Militant orders circling.

---

### 3. The Lawlands (Regio Legalis)

**Local Name:** The Old Provinces

**Character:** Ancient settled territory with deep Imperial roots. Universities, law courts, old aristocratic families. The Empire's intellectual and legal center.

**Capital:** Lexium

**Geography:**
- Rolling terrain along the Reginwynn River
- Old Roman-style planned towns
- Extensive archives and libraries
- University grounds and academies

**City Density:** High — 1 major city per 70 miles, old established pattern

**Major Settlements:**
- **Lexium** — City of Laws; Supreme Tribunal, University (Pre: 120,000 / Post: ~70,000)
- Various academy-towns and archive-cities

**Post-Passing State:** Relative stability. The University Chancellor governs. Haven for scholars, freethinkers, those fleeing the Scouring. Represents hope for rebuilding through knowledge rather than force.

---

### 4. The Rivervales (Regio Fluvialis)

**Local Name:** The Vales

**Character:** River valleys radiating from the plateau. Major trade routes. Market towns where valleys meet. The Empire's commercial arteries.

**Capital:** Confluencia

**Geography:**
- Multiple river valleys descending from highlands
- Natural fords and bridge-points
- Linear settlement along watercourses
- Mills, warehouses, trading posts

**City Density:** Moderate-High — 1 major city per 80 miles, linear along rivers

**Major Settlements:**
- **Confluencia** — Where multiple rivers meet; major trade hub
- Numerous river-towns at strategic crossings

**Post-Passing State:** Trade disrupted but rivers still flow. River transport remains safer than roads. Towns at confluences maintain importance.

---

### 5. The Midlands (Regio Media)

**Local Name:** The Commons

**Character:** Rolling hills, mixed farming, "ordinary" Imperial territory. Neither wealthy nor poor. The backbone of the Empire—unremarkable but essential.

**Capital:** Mediolanium

**Geography:**
- Gentle rolling terrain
- Mixed agriculture (grain, livestock, orchards)
- Dispersed village pattern
- Market towns at crossroads

**City Density:** Moderate — 1 major city per 100 miles, dispersed villages

**Major Settlements:**
- **Mediolanium** — "Middle-land"; typical Imperial provincial capital
- Scattered market towns serving agricultural hinterland

**Post-Passing State:** Quietly surviving. Less dramatic than other regions. Local lords and village councils maintaining order. The Reft are present but manageable with vigilance.

---

### 6. The Marchfields (Regio Limitanea)

**Local Name:** The Borders

**Character:** Transitional zones toward other regions. Frontier character. Military presence. Where Imperial culture meets regional traditions.

**Capital:** Castrum Novum

**Geography:**
- Varied terrain transitioning to neighboring regions
- Fortress-towns at strategic points
- Military roads and supply depots
- Buffer zones and borderlands

**City Density:** Moderate — 1 major city per 120 miles, fortress-towns

**Major Settlements:**
- **Castrum Novum** — "New Fort"; frontier garrison town grown to city
- Chain of fortress-towns along regional boundaries

**Post-Passing State:** Militarized. Local commanders have significant autonomy. Some maintain Imperial loyalty; others have become independent warlords.

# Region Two: The North (Provincia Borealis)

## Overview

Cold, mountainous, independent-minded. Home to the Axis Faith and the dwarven undercities. The Solarian Church's grip has always been weakest here. Hardy peoples with strong local traditions.

**Climate:** Cold (subarctic to alpine)
**Linguistic Influence:** Germanic/Norse
**Religious Character:** Axis Faith dominant in mountains; mixed traditions elsewhere; Church presence nominal

## Sub-Regions

### 1. The High Marches (Regio Montana)

**Local Name:** Fjallmark ("Mountain-Mark")

**Character:** The Axis Mountains proper. Dwarven territory below; thin human settlement above. The Meeting Point between powers Above and Below. Sacred to the Axis Faith.

**Capital:** Nordgard

**Geography:**
- The Axis Mountain range
- High peaks, deep valleys, mountain passes
- Dwarven gates at strategic points
- The ruined city of Skyhallow

- Dwarven gate-cities: Thrymheim, Keldheim, Kobalthall (underground, populations not counted in surface totals)

**Post-Passing State:** Devastated above, secure below. The Surveyor peoples (sky-dwellers) were destroyed. Dwarves have largely retreated underground. Surface settlements isolated but surviving.

---

### 2. The Fjordlands (Regio Sinus)

**Local Name:** Fjörðheim ("Fjord-Home")

**Character:** Coastal fjords cutting deep into the mountains. Fishing, shipbuilding, maritime culture. Regular contact (and conflict) with Ynys Wyllt raiders.

**Capital:** Fjordhavn

**Geography:**
- Deep fjords providing natural harbors
- Steep valley walls, limited farmland
- Fishing grounds and whaling waters
- Signal towers along coastline

**City Density:** Low-Moderate — 1 major city per 150 miles, concentrated in harbor-heads

**Major Settlements:**
- **Fjordhavn** — Fjord-Haven; northernmost Imperial port (Pre: 20,000 / Post: ~12,000)
- Harbor-towns at heads of major fjords

**Post-Passing State:** Isolated but self-sufficient. Admiral Tova Storm-Singer maintains order. Made peace with local Wylltic elements. Strange reports from northern waters.

---

### 3. The Pinelands (Regio Silvae Borealis)

**Local Name:** Barrskogar ("Needle-Forest")

**Character:** Dense conifer forests between mountains and coast. Logging, hunting, fur trade. Sparse population, strong local traditions. The forest provides.

**Capital:** Holmgard

**Geography:**
- Vast conifer forests
- Rivers used for log transport
- Scattered clearings with small settlements
- Hunting grounds and trapping territories

**City Density:** Low — 1 major city per 180 miles, logging towns along rivers

**Major Settlements:**
- **Holmgard** — "Island-Fort"; timber trade center on river island
- Logging camps and trading posts

**Post-Passing State:** Least affected of northern sub-regions. Forest provides concealment from Reft. Communities small and scattered enough to avoid attention. Traditional ways serving them well.

---

## North Summary

| Sub-Region | Capital | City Density | Character |
|------------|---------|--------------|-----------|
| High Marches | Nordgard | Low | Mountains, dwarven gates |
| Fjordlands | Fjordhavn | Low-Moderate | Coastal fjords, fishing |
| Pinelands | Holmgard | Low | Forests, logging |

**Estimated Major Cities:** 8-12 (pre-Passing)

**Notes:**
- Most "cities" here would be called large towns elsewhere
- Dwarven undercities add significant population not reflected in surface figures
- Skyhallow's destruction left no clear spiritual capital

---

# Region Three: The South (Provincia Meridiana)

## Overview

Hot, ancient, dominated by Dragon-kin influence. River valley civilizations older than the Empire. The meeting of human and draconic cultures. Old traditions run deep beneath Church overlay.

**Climate:** Hot (Mediterranean to arid)
**Linguistic Influence:** Latin + Dragon-kin languages (Sanskrit-Sumerian, Sino-Romano)
**Religious Character:** Officially Solarian; actually a complex syncretism with Dragon-kin and older desert traditions

## Sub-Regions

### 1. The Delta Lands (Regio Deltae)

**Local Name:** Nīlabhūmi ("River-Land")

**Character:** The great river delta where the Vitaflum meets the sea. Densest human population in the south. Ancient cities, irrigation networks, the breadbasket of the southern Empire.

**Capital:** Khaldera

**Geography:**
- Branching river delta
- Extensive irrigation canals
- Ancient cities on river branches
- Desert encroaching at margins

**City Density:** High (along water) — 1 major city per 60 miles along rivers, almost nothing in desert

**Major Settlements:**
- **Khaldera** — The River-Crown; human capital of southern provinces (Pre: 200,000 / Post: ~90,000)
- Ancient temple-cities along river branches
- Oasis towns at desert margins

**Post-Passing State:** Dragon-kin have withdrawn. Old traditions reviving. Croc-kin and Tapassan communities now essential for survival. The Church's grip loosening.

---

### 2. The Jewel Hills (Regio Gemmarum)

**Local Name:** Ratnaparvata ("Gem-Mountain")

**Character:** Hill country rising from the delta. Precious stone and metal mining. Cooler elevation, summer retreat for the wealthy. Growing center for crystal-tech research.

**Capital:** Zircon

**Geography:**
- Rolling hill country
- Mine complexes for gems and metals
- Cooler climate at elevation
- Trade routes connecting to delta and Dragon-kin territories

**City Density:** Moderate — 1 major city per 100 miles, mining towns

**Major Settlements:**
- **Zircon** — The Jewel-City; gem-trade center (Pre: 35,000 / Post: ~25,000)
- Mining towns in the hills
- Summer estates of delta aristocracy

**Post-Passing State:** Pivoting from luxury trade to practical applications. Crystal-tech research growing. Kobalthari advisors increasingly influential. Potential rival to Tyrlóng.

---

### 3. The Dragonlands (Regio Draconum)

**Local Name:** Nāgadeśa ("Dragon-Country")

**Character:** Dragon-kin homeland proper. Vast spaces with enormous but sparse Dragon-kin cities. Human villages serve dragon lords. Functionally autonomous despite nominal Imperial sovereignty.

**Capital:** Lóngyuán (Dragon-kin capital; human administration through Khaldera)

**Geography:**
- Vast open territories
- Ziggurat-cities of the Dragon-kin
- Cultivated wilderness between cities
- Deep earth connections to the Sleeping Ones

**City Density:** Very Low (by design) — 1 major city per 300+ miles, but Dragon-kin cities have enormous footprints

**Major Settlements:**
- **Nāgarat** — City of the Serpent-Kings; Mush-Nāga capital, oldest city in the world
- **Lóngyuán** — Dragon-Abyss; Lóng-Imperiales administrative center
- **Tiānmén** — Heaven's Gate; Tiān-Phanes philosophical academy
- Human service-villages scattered between

**Post-Passing State:** Least affected of all regions. Dragon-kin wards provided protection. Watching and waiting. Debating whether to help the Empire or let it fall.

**Political Complexity:** Technically a sub-region of Provincia Meridiana; practically an autonomous power. The Consilium Draconis makes its own decisions regardless of Imperial authority.

---

## South Summary

| Sub-Region | Capital | City Density | Character |
|------------|---------|--------------|-----------|
| Delta Lands | Khaldera | High (riverine) | Ancient river civilization |
| Jewel Hills | Zircon | Moderate | Mining, gems, crystal-tech |
| Dragonlands | Lóngyuán | Very Low | Dragon-kin autonomous territory |

**Estimated Major Cities:** 12-18 (pre-Passing, counting Dragon-kin cities)

**Notes:**
- Dragon-kin cities are enormous in footprint but sparse in population density
- Human cities concentrate along water; desert is nearly empty
- The Dragonlands' "very low" density is by design, not circumstance

---

# Region Four: The West (Provincia Occidentalis)

## Overview

Forested, Celtic-influenced, older traditions persistent. Dominated by the Kingswood—the great ancient forest that was never fully tamed. The Church's presence here always had a folk-tradition undertone.

**Climate:** Mixed (oceanic to temperate forest)
**Linguistic Influence:** Brythonic/Celtic
**Religious Character:** Nominally Solarian; practically a syncretism with folk traditions; Fae influence in the forest

## Sub-Regions

### 1. The Kingswood (Regio Silva Regia)

**Local Name:** Coillrí ("King's-Wood")

**Character:** The great ancient forest. Fae territory. Forest Elves. Folk traditions never suppressed. The Church claimed jurisdiction; the forest disagreed.

**Capital:** Caerderw (Imperial: Quercum Castrum; Common: Oakhold)

**Geography:**
- Hundreds of miles of ancient growth forest
- The Coillwynn, Derwyn, and Cenwyn rivers
- Fae Age hill-fort at Caerderw
- Hidden groves and sacred sites
- Underworld access points in the deepest woods

**City Density:** Very Low — 1 major city per 250 miles, scattered forest-towns (many not on Imperial maps)

**Major Settlements:**
- **Caerderw** — Forest capital; built on Fae Age hill-fort with Cathedral around standing stone
- Forest-towns at river crossings and traditional gathering points
- Settlements the Empire never mapped

**Post-Passing State:** The forest has *closed*. Paths that worked for centuries lead in circles. The Fae are in crisis—deciding what to do about humanity's failure and their own. Caerderw is isolated but relatively safe within the closure.

---

### 2. The Western Shore (Regio Litoralis)

**Local Name:** Arfordir ("Sea-Coast")

**Character:** Coastal strip between forest and sea. Fishing, maritime trade, naval presence. Regular contact with Ynys Wyllt—sometimes trade, sometimes raids.

**Capital:** Dun Mara

**Geography:**
- Rocky coastline with natural harbors
- River mouths providing access to interior
- Signal towers and naval fortifications
- The edge of the known western world

**City Density:** Moderate — 1 major city per 100 miles, linear along coast

**Major Settlements:**
- **Dun Mara** — Sea-Fort; western naval fortress (Pre: 15,000 / Post: ~8,000)
- **Coedporth** (Imperial: Portus Silvarum) — Forest-Port; where Coillwynn meets sea (Pre: 40,000 / Post: ~20,000)
- Fishing harbors and trading posts

**Post-Passing State:** Caught between two mysteries—the forest that closed behind them and the sea that's changing in ways no one understands. The Western Fleet reduced to twelve ships. Admiral Blackwater watching westward for something he can't name.

---

### 3. The Old Downs (Regio Collium)

**Local Name:** Bryniau Hen ("Ancient Hills")

**Character:** Rolling chalk hills south of the forest. Sheep country. Ancient monuments—standing stones, barrows, hill figures. The old ways never died here; they just went quiet.

**Capital:** Caer Bryn

**Geography:**
- Chalk downland with thin soil
- Ancient monuments and sacred sites
- Sheep pastures and wool production
- Hilltop settlements with long views

**City Density:** Moderate — 1 major city per 120 miles, hilltop settlements

**Major Settlements:**
- **Caer Bryn** — "Hill-Fort"; ancient hilltop settlement, regional market
- Wool-trading towns
- Pilgrimage sites (to both Church and older traditions)

**Post-Passing State:** Quietly returning to old ways. The standing stones are being tended again. The barrows are being honored. The Church presence was always thin here; now it's almost gone.

---

### 4. The Greenmarches (Regio Viridis)

**Local Name:** Glasfro ("Green-Land")

**Character:** Transitional zone where forest meets farmland. Contested traditions—neither fully Imperial nor fully forest-folk. Market towns serving both worlds.

**Capital:** Aber Glas

**Geography:**
- Mixed woodland and farmland
- Forest edge constantly shifting
- Market towns at traditional meeting points
- Neither fully tamed nor fully wild

**City Density:** Moderate — 1 major city per 100 miles, market towns

**Major Settlements:**
- **Aber Glas** — "Green River-Mouth"; where forest meets farmland
- Market towns where forest products meet agricultural goods
- Villages that shift between traditions as convenient

**Post-Passing State:** Uncertain. The forest's closure affects trade. People here always kept one foot in each world; now they're not sure which world to stand in.

---

## West Summary

| Sub-Region | Capital | City Density | Character |
|------------|---------|--------------|-----------|
| Kingswood | Caerderw | Very Low | Ancient forest, Fae |
| Western Shore | Dun Mara | Moderate | Coastal, naval |
| Old Downs | Caer Bryn | Moderate | Chalk hills, ancient sites |
| Greenmarches | Aber Glas | Moderate | Forest edge, transitional |

**Estimated Major Cities:** 15-20 (pre-Passing)

**Notes:**
- Many Kingswood settlements aren't on Imperial maps
- The forest's closure has reshaped regional dynamics
- Caerderw remains appropriate capital despite isolation—other cities lack legitimacy

---

# Region Five: The East (Provincia Orientalis)

## Overview

Coastal, trading, cosmopolitan. The Empire's window to the wider world. Elf-influenced in parts, connected to Shiranui trade routes. Wealth flows through here—or did.

**Climate:** Maritime (temperate coastal)
**Linguistic Influence:** Trade-creole mixing Imperial, Elvish, and Shiranui elements
**Religious Character:** Officially Solarian; practically tolerant of anything that doesn't disrupt trade

## Sub-Regions

### 1. The Golden Coast (Regio Aurea)

**Local Name:** Traeth Aur ("Golden Beach")

**Character:** The main trading coast. Wealthy ports, cosmopolitan populations, merchant princes. The Empire's economic engine. More concerned with commerce than piety.

**Capital:** Portus Aureus

**Geography:**
- Crescent harbors and trading ports
- Warehouse districts and merchant quarters
- Consulate rows and foreign enclaves
- Maritime approaches to the eastern sea

**City Density:** High — 1 major city per 50 miles, dense port network

**Major Settlements:**
- **Portus Aureus** — Golden-Port; the Empire's gateway to the east (Pre: 150,000 / Post: ~60,000)
- Chain of trading ports along the coast
- Shipyards and naval facilities

**Post-Passing State:** The Empire's lifeline. Trade with Shiranui continues, though reduced. Council of Captains rules. If the eastern trade dies, so does hope for recovery.

---

### 2. The Elvish Pale (Regio Goleuwyr)

**Local Name:** Tir Golau ("Land of Light")

**Character:** Territory around Aurhalion. Mixed human-elf population. Light traditions stronger here than anywhere else in the Empire. Semi-autonomous before the Passing; more so now.

**Capital:** Aurhalion

**Geography:**
- Coastal and interior territories around the elf city
- Architecture blending human and Goleuwyr styles
- Shrines to Light tradition (some hidden, some open)
- Access to Thalaurion's island

**City Density:** Moderate-High — 1 major city per 80 miles, though elf settlements don't follow human patterns

**Major Settlements:**
- **Aurhalion** — Golden Hall of Light; the Imperial Elf City
- **Thalaurion** — Far Golden Place; the independent elf island-city (functionally separate)
- Mixed human-elf towns following Light traditions

**Post-Passing State:** Thalaurion has closed entirely. Aurhalion debates emergence vs. hiding. The Revealed faction gaining strength. The Hidden urging patience. The relationship with human authorities is... complicated.

---

### 3. The Island Reach (Regio Insularum)

**Local Name:** Ynysfor ("Island-Sea")

**Character:** Eastern islands still under nominal Imperial influence. Trading posts in the contested zone between Empire and Shiranui. Pirate havens. Opportunistic loyalties.

**Capital:** Portus Medius

**Geography:**
- Hundreds of islands (volcanic chain)
- Natural harbors and anchorages
- Limited agricultural land
- Strategic positions for trade control

**City Density:** Low — 1 major city per island group, scattered

**Major Settlements:**
- **Portus Medius** — The largest, most "civilized" trading post
- **Freeport** — Pirate haven, no questions asked
- Various trading posts with shifting allegiances

**Post-Passing State:** Chaos. Some islands devastated, others untouched (seemingly random). Pirates and traders and survivors mixing. Allegiances mean nothing; survival means everything.

---

### 4. The Hintercoast (Regio Posterior)

**Local Name:** Cefnfor ("Back-Sea")

**Character:** Less developed coast north of the main ports. Fishing communities, small-scale trade. Never wealthy enough to matter much to the Empire. Now, never wealthy enough to attract trouble.

**Capital:** Porthgaer

**Geography:**
- Rocky coastline, small harbors
- Fishing grounds
- Limited agricultural hinterland
- Connection routes to northern regions

**City Density:** Low-Moderate — 1 major city per 130 miles, fishing towns

**Major Settlements:**
- **Porthgaer** — "Fort-Harbor"; northern fishing port
- Fishing villages and small trading posts

**Post-Passing State:** Quietly surviving. Never depended on the Empire much; not missing it much now. Fishing continues. Communities small enough to avoid attention.

---

## East Summary

| Sub-Region | Capital | City Density | Character |
|------------|---------|--------------|-----------|
| Golden Coast | Portus Aureus | High | Trading ports, wealth |
| Elvish Pale | Aurhalion | Moderate-High | Mixed human-elf, Light traditions |
| Island Reach | Portus Medius | Low | Contested islands, pirates |
| Hintercoast | Porthgaer | Low-Moderate | Fishing, small trade |

**Estimated Major Cities:** 20-25 (pre-Passing)

**Notes:**
- Thalaurion is technically part of Elvish Pale but functionally independent
- The Island Reach blurs into Shiranui's sphere of influence
- The Golden Coast's survival may determine the Empire's future
