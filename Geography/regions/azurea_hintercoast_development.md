# Azurea: Hintercoast Sub-Region Development
## Provincia Orientalis — The Forgotten Shore

---

# Overview

The Hintercoast (Imperial: *Litus Ulterior*, Local: *Traethcefn*) is the northern stretch of the eastern coast, where the prosperous Golden Coast gives way to rockier shores, deeper forests, and communities that never quite embraced Imperial cosmopolitanism. Where Portus Aureus gleams with foreign wealth, the Hintercoast endures on what the sea provides—and the sea provides less generously here.

This is a land of fishing villages, cliff-side shrines, and people who remember older ways. The Empire claimed it centuries ago; the people paid their taxes and largely continued as before. The Church built cathedrals; the fisherfolk kept leaving offerings at the Standing Stones. The merchants came seeking trade routes; they found harbors too shallow for great ships and moved on.

The Passing hit hard here—not with the concentrated devastation of the cities, but with the slow horror of isolation. When the trade networks collapsed, the Hintercoast discovered it had been forgotten. No relief came. No legions marched to restore order. The fishing communities that had always been self-sufficient found themselves *only* self-sufficient, cut off from a world that had more pressing concerns.

Now, seven years later, the Hintercoast has become something new: neither Imperial nor truly independent, neither prosperous nor desperate, a region finding its own way while the rest of the world burns.

# Part One: The Capital

## Porthgaer — The Fort-Haven

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Imperial Name** | Portus Vallum ("Walled Port") |
| **Local Name** | Porthgaer (PORTH-gair, "Fort-Haven") |
| **Location** | Where the River Glas meets the sea, on a natural harbor protected by twin headlands |
| **Pre-Passing Population** | ~28,000 |
| **Post-Passing Population** | ~16,000 |

### Geography and Layout

Porthgaer sits where the River Glas carves through coastal cliffs to reach the sea. The harbor is naturally sheltered—the twin headlands called the Horns (Corn Gogledd and Corn Deheu) break the worst ocean swells, creating a calm anchorage even in winter storms. The river mouth is wide enough for fishing boats and small traders but too shallow for the great merchant vessels that made Portus Aureus wealthy.

The city rises in tiers from the waterfront. The oldest district—the Harbourtown—crowds against the water, a maze of narrow streets, fish markets, and chandleries. Above it, the Middle Town spreads across the gentler slopes, holding the craftsmen's quarters, the modest merchant houses, and the administrative buildings of Imperial rule. At the summit, the Citadel occupies the ancient hill-fort that gave the city its name—a pre-Imperial fortification expanded by successive governors into something approaching a castle.

### The Four Quarters

#### The Harbourtown (Y Porthref)

The oldest district, hugging the waterfront in a crescent around the inner harbor.

**Character:** Salt-stained, fish-reeking, perpetually damp. Buildings of weathered grey stone and tarred timber lean against each other like old drunks. The streets are too narrow for carts; everything moves by hand or basket. The fish market begins before dawn and ends by mid-morning; by afternoon, the same square hosts mending circles where nets are repaired by communal effort.

**Notable Features:**
- **The Long Wharf** — The only pier capable of handling larger vessels, jealously maintained
- **The Fish Market (Marchnad Pysgod)** — Heart of the economy; prices set here ripple through the region
- **The Sailors' Chapel** — Officially Solarian, but the carved faces on its pillars are older gods
- **The Rope-Walk** — A long covered alley where rope-makers ply their trade

**Post-Passing:** Functioning. The fishing trade continues—fish don't care about apocalypses. The population has actually *increased* slightly as refugees from the Golden Coast settled here, finding the Hintercoast's poverty preferable to the chaos of wealthier regions.

---

#### The Middle Town (Y Canolref)

The commercial and residential heart of the city, spread across the slopes above the harbor.

**Character:** More spacious than the Harbourtown, with actual streets wide enough for carts and houses that have separate rooms. This is where successful fishermen become boat-owners, where craftsmen maintain workshops, where the minor merchants who couldn't afford Portus Aureus built their counting-houses. Imperial architecture mixes with local styles—tile roofs beside slate, columns beside standing stones repurposed as doorposts.

**Notable Features:**
- **The Guildhall** — Seat of the Fishers' Brotherhood, now effectively the city government
- **The Imperial Courthouse** — Marble facade, largely empty, occasionally used for meetings
- **The Chandlers' Row** — Suppliers of everything maritime, now trading as much in rumor as rope
- **The Weavers' Street** — Linen and wool for sails, nets, and clothing

**Post-Passing:** Adapting. The administrative functions have collapsed; the Guildhall has absorbed most governance. Property values are meaningless—people live where they can, and the middle-class pretensions of the pre-Passing era seem quaint now.

---

#### The Height (Y Brig)

The upper slopes where the respectable and wealthy built their homes.

**Character:** Quieter, airier, with actual gardens and views of the sea. Before the Passing, Imperial administrators, successful merchants, and the local gentry built houses here that aped metropolitan fashions—columns, atria, formal gardens. The architecture ranges from genuinely elegant to provincial awkwardness.

**Notable Features:**
- **The Governor's Residence** — Abandoned; the last governor fled south during the Passing
- **The Temple of the Light** — The city's cathedral, well-built but never grand
- **The Merchant Houses** — The homes of the trading families, most now subdivided or abandoned
- **The Old Gardens** — Terraced pleasure gardens, now partly converted to vegetables

**Post-Passing:** Hollowed out. Many of the wealthy fled or died. The Governor's Residence sits empty—no one wants to claim it and invite attention. Some houses have been occupied by refugees; others slowly decay. The Temple functions, but attendance has... evolved.

---

#### The Citadel (Y Gaer)

The ancient hill-fort at the city's summit, expanded into a proper fortification.

**Character:** Stone walls thick enough to shrug off siege engines, built in layers over centuries. The oldest core is pre-Imperial—cyclopean blocks fitted without mortar. The Romans... no, the *Imperials* added their own work, and subsequent governors elaborated further. The result is a fortress of concentric walls, cramped courtyards, and passages that don't quite make sense.

**Notable Features:**
- **The Old Fort** — The original pre-Imperial fortification, now the innermost ward
- **The Garrison Hall** — Built to house three hundred soldiers; now holds perhaps sixty
- **The Signal Tower** — Highest point in the city; maintains beacon communication with other coastal forts
- **The Magazine** — Imperial supplies, carefully rationed; the real source of the Garrison Commander's power

**Post-Passing:** Functional. The Imperial garrison, reduced but intact, maintains the Citadel under Commander Aldric Stern. They've neither joined the chaos nor attempted to impose order beyond the walls. They wait, watch, and carefully husband their resources.

---

### Landmarks

#### The Horns (Y Cyrn)

The twin headlands protecting the harbor. Each is crowned with ancient structures—the Northern Horn holds a lighthouse that predates Imperial rule (the locals kept the flame; the Imperials merely formalized it), while the Southern Horn bears the ruins of a pre-Imperial temple, now considered unlucky.

The passage between the Horns is called the Throat (Y Gwddf). Ships must navigate carefully; the rocks on either side have claimed many vessels over centuries. The wrecks are still visible at low tide, encrusted with barnacles and increasingly strange growths since the Passing.

#### The Standing Stone Market

In the center of the Middle Town stands a menhir—a single standing stone twice the height of a man, worn smooth by centuries of hands touching it for luck. The Imperials built the market square around it rather than move it (wise, given local sentiment). On market days, the square fills with stalls; on other days, people still touch the stone when passing.

Since the Passing, someone has begun leaving offerings at the stone's base again—flowers, fish, small carved figures. No one admits to doing it. No one stops it.

#### The Sailors' Graveyard

On the southern headland, overlooking the sea, the cemetery where those who die at sea are memorialized (the bodies rarely return). Each grave holds only symbolic contents—a personal effect, a carved name, a handful of sand from the last beach the deceased walked. Before the Passing, Church officials frowned on the practice. Now, no one objects when families perform the old rites at the empty graves.

#### The River Mouth

Where the Glas meets the sea, the river spreads into a tidal estuary—mudflats at low tide, navigable water at high. The mudflats have always provided: shellfish, sea-birds, reeds for thatching. Since the Passing, the estuary has become stranger. The mud itself seems *different*—darker, sometimes warm to the touch. Things grow there that weren't seen before. The fisherfolk harvest carefully now, and some areas are simply avoided.

---

### Who Rules

**The Formal Answer:** Imperial Governor Gaius Marinus Proculus, appointed by Aurheim.

**The Reality:** Governor Proculus fled during the Passing's first wave, reportedly making it as far as Portus Aureus before the chaos swallowed him. No replacement has been appointed; no one in the crumbling Imperial administration remembers Porthgaer exists.

**The Actual Power Structure:**

| Authority | Basis | Reach |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| **The Fishers' Brotherhood** | Economic control, tradition | The city, the fishing fleet, trade |
| **Commander Aldric Stern** | Military force, Imperial supplies | The Citadel, the garrison, limited patrols |
| **Father Cedric Long** | Spiritual authority, community respect | The faithful, charitable distribution |
| **The Council of Elders** | Informal respect, local knowledge | The old families, traditional matters |

These four powers have reached an uneasy equilibrium. The Brotherhood handles day-to-day governance; the Commander maintains defense; Father Cedric manages spiritual and charitable matters; the Elders are consulted on disputes and traditions. It works, mostly, because no one wants to be in charge when things fall apart.

---

### The Tension

**The Surface Conflict:** The Brotherhood wants to expand fishing territory northward, into waters traditionally fished by the independent villages. Commander Stern opposes provoking conflict with limited military resources. Father Cedric wants to send missionaries to those same villages. The Elders remember old feuds and counsel patience.

**The Deeper Conflict:** The city is changing. The old Imperial identity is fading—taxes unpaid, laws unenforced, the Church increasingly irrelevant. Something older is reasserting itself. The Standing Stone receives offerings again. The fisherfolk speak of the *Morforwyn* (sea-spirits) as if they're real. The Solarian symbols in the Sailors' Chapel are quietly being supplemented with older carvings.

Some see this as the natural recovery of suppressed tradition. Others see dangerous backsliding into superstition. Commander Stern doesn't care what people believe as long as they don't riot. Father Cedric prays for guidance and receives silence. The Brotherhood is too busy keeping everyone fed to worry about theology.

And in the estuary, the strange growths spread a little further each season.

# Part Two: Secondary Settlements

## Aberheli — The Salt-Mouth

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Imperial Name** | Salinae Ostium |
| **Location** | Northern coast, where salt-pans line a shallow bay |
| **Population** | Pre-Passing: ~4,500 / Post-Passing: ~3,200 |
| **Type** | Industrial town (salt production) |

### Character

Salt made Aberheli. The shallow bay, the reliable sun (rare on this coast), the clay-rich soil—all combined to create ideal conditions for salt production. For centuries, workers have raked seawater into shallow pans, waited for evaporation, and harvested the white crystals that preserve fish, cure meat, and enable the entire coastal economy.

The town is utilitarian, almost ugly. Rows of evaporation pans stretch along the shore like a geometric disease. The workers' cottages are uniform, practical, salt-bleached. The only beautiful building is the Salt-Masters' Hall, where the guild that controls production meets and celebrates its monopoly.

**The Economy:** Salt is life here. The Salt-Masters' Guild controls production, sets prices, and maintains the pans. Before the Passing, most salt went south to Portus Aureus and beyond. Now, it stays regional—but that's made it more valuable, not less. Every fishing village needs salt; Aberheli has salt; the math is simple.

**Post-Passing:** The town has become essential. With long-distance trade collapsed, local salt production is the only option. The Salt-Masters have become rich in real terms—not gold, but favors, goods, obligations. They're careful not to overplay their hand; monopolists who gouge during famines tend to meet unfortunate ends.

### Notable Feature: The White Road

The road from Aberheli to Porthgaer is called the White Road because salt-carts have traveled it for so long that the packed earth has become crusted with spilled crystals. On moonlit nights, the road seems to glow. Locals tell stories of travelers who follow the White Road and arrive somewhere unexpected—a village that isn't on any map, a market where the traders aren't quite human.

Since the Passing, some travelers have actually experienced this. Most won't discuss it.

---

## Carreg Wen — The White Rock

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Imperial Name** | Saxum Album |
| **Location** | A dramatic white chalk headland jutting into the sea |
| **Population** | Pre-Passing: ~2,800 / Post-Passing: ~1,900 |
| **Type** | Fishing village, pilgrimage site |

### Character

The White Rock is impossible to miss—a chalk headland that rises two hundred feet from the waves, gleaming white against the grey sea. The village huddles at its base, where a small harbor provides shelter. The chalk cliffs are riddled with caves, some natural, some expanded by centuries of use.

Before the Empire, this was a sacred site. The caves held shrines; pilgrims came to consult the sea-oracles who lived in the darkness and spoke prophecies from the waves' rhythm. The Church officially ended this practice. The caves were sealed. The oracles were... dealt with.

**The Hidden Truth:** The caves weren't fully sealed. Some passages remain, known to certain families, used for purposes the Church preferred not to examine. The oracles weren't entirely eliminated either. What lives in the deepest caves now is different from what lived there before—but something still answers when the old words are spoken.

**Post-Passing:** Pilgrims have begun returning. Not to the Church's small chapel on the headland—to the caves. The seals have been broken, officially by storm damage, actually by deliberate effort. The fishing families that always kept the old ways are becoming the village's spiritual leaders, and what they're leading toward isn't Solarian.

### Notable Feature: The Speaking Caves

The cave system within the chalk has remarkable acoustics. Whispers carry for hundreds of feet; the crash of waves creates rhythms that sound almost like words. Before the Church, oracle-priests would enter the caves, fast for days, and emerge with prophecies interpreted from the waves' "speech."

Now, people are entering again. Some report hearing actual words—names of the dead, warnings, cryptic guidance. Whether this is acoustics, psychology, or something genuinely supernatural is impossible to determine. The practical effect is the same: Carreg Wen is becoming a pilgrimage site again, and no Imperial authority exists to stop it.

## Llanmor — The Sea-Church

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Imperial Name** | Ecclesia Maritima |
| **Location** | Coastal village where an ancient church stands half in the sea |
| **Population** | Pre-Passing: ~1,600 / Post-Passing: ~900 |
| **Type** | Fishing village, religious site |

### Character

Llanmor would be unremarkable except for the church. Centuries ago—before the Empire, before memory—someone built a stone chapel on the shore. Sea level has risen since, or the land has sunk, and now the church stands half-submerged. At low tide, the nave is merely damp; at high tide, the altar drowns.

The Solarian Church never knew what to do with this place. It's clearly sacred—pilgrims have come for centuries—but sacred to *what*? The building predates the Church by unknown ages. The carvings on the walls show figures that might be saints or might be something else entirely. The altar itself is a single block of stone that *hums* at certain tides.

**The Practice:** Whatever its origins, Llanmor has developed its own rituals. Services are held at low tide. Baptisms occur as the tide rises—the congregation wades deeper as the ceremony progresses, emerging blessed and drenched. The dead are given to the sea from the church steps. None of this is orthodox. All of it feels *correct* in a way that orthodoxy struggles to match.

**Post-Passing:** The Church has stopped objecting. There's no bishop to complain to; the local priest has gone native; the villagers don't care what Vandgwyn thinks. The sea-church continues as it always has, perhaps more openly now, certainly with more visitors from other villages seeking something the regular Church can't provide.

### Notable Feature: The Humming Stone

The altar—a massive block of sea-worn granite—produces a low hum at specific tidal conditions. Local tradition holds that the hum is the voice of the sea itself, and that those who learn to understand it can know the ocean's moods: where fish school, when storms approach, which waters to avoid.

Since the Passing, the hum has changed. It's louder now, more complex. Some claim to hear words in it. Others say it responds when spoken to.

---

## Castell Môr — The Great Castle

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Imperial Name** | Castrum Magnus |
| **Location** | A dramatic sea-stack fortress, connected to shore by a natural causeway |
| **Population** | Pre-Passing: ~1,200 (garrison town) / Post-Passing: ~600 |
| **Type** | Fortress, garrison, coastal defense |

### Character

Nature built the foundation—a sea-stack rising eighty feet from the waves, connected to shore by a causeway that floods at high tide. Humans added walls, towers, and the conviction that this position could hold against any enemy. And it has. Castell Môr has never fallen to assault. The stack makes it nearly impossible to approach in force; the causeway becomes a killing ground; the walls are thick enough to ignore anything but prolonged siege.

Before the Empire, local kings fortified the stack. The Imperials expanded it into a proper coastal fortress, part of the chain meant to guard against Wylltic raiders and keep the eastern trade routes secure. A garrison of two hundred held it; a small town grew at the causeway's landward end to service their needs.

**The Isolation:** Castell Môr was always distant from the main routes. The Passing made it utterly isolated. The garrison lost contact with command, lost half their number to plague, lost any sense of mission. What remains is a fortress without a purpose—soldiers with no orders, walls with nothing to guard against.

**Post-Passing:** Garrison Commander Mira Stone keeps her people alive through a combination of discipline, fishing, and carefully managed decline. She's negotiated informal arrangements with nearby villages—protection in exchange for food—that make her effectively a minor warlord. She doesn't call herself that. She still wears Imperial insignia. But the Empire she served is gone, and everyone knows it.

### Notable Feature: The Tide Gate

The causeway floods twice daily, making the fortress genuinely inaccessible for several hours. The garrison has elaborated this into a formal ritual—the Tide Gate. At high tide, a horn sounds; the causeway guards withdraw; the fortress is sealed. Anyone caught outside must wait for low tide. Anyone caught inside must wait equally long.

This has practical security value, but it's become something more—a rhythm that defines fortress life, a ritual that gives meaning to the isolation. Commander Stone has encouraged this, recognizing that soldiers need structure when purpose fails.

# Part Three: Notable Sites

## The Drowned Forest (Y Goedwig Foddedig)

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Location** | Coastal shallows north of Porthgaer |
| **Type** | Natural feature, sacred site, dangerous zone |

### The Place

At the lowest tides, they emerge—the stumps and fallen trunks of an ancient forest, preserved in the cold sea, visible only when the water retreats far enough. The Drowned Forest stretches for miles along the northern shore, a ghost woodland that existed when sea levels were lower, or the land was higher, or the world was simply different.

Local legend holds that a kingdom once stood here, drowned by the sea in punishment for some forgotten sin. The tree stumps are all that remain of its great forest. The lumps beneath the sand are its buildings. On certain nights, they say, you can hear bells ringing beneath the waves—the bells of the drowned churches, still calling the dead to prayer.

**The Reality:** Something *did* exist here, and it wasn't simply trees. Among the preserved wood, divers have found worked stones, carved artifacts, structures that were clearly deliberate. This predates the Empire by millennia. It predates the Goleuwyr presence. Whatever kingdom drowned here belongs to a history no one remembers.

**The Danger:** The Drowned Forest is shifting. Since the Passing, the preserved wood has begun to move—not by tide or current, but *purposefully*. Fishermen report submerged logs blocking passages that were clear days before. Divers find the arrangements changed between visits. Something in the Drowned Forest is rearranging itself, and no one knows why.

### The Hook

A scholar from Lexium arrived six months ago seeking to document the Drowned Forest's ruins. She disappeared three weeks later. Her boat was found drifting, empty, her notebooks left aboard. The final entry reads: *"The trees are not random. They're a message. I finally understand what it says. I'm going to answer."*

No one has searched for her. No one wants to know what she found.

---

## The Fishermen's Shrine (Cysegr y Pysgodwyr)

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Location** | Sea-cave accessible only at extreme low tide |
| **Type** | Sacred site, pre-Imperial remnant |

### The Place

Twice yearly, at the lowest spring tides, a cave mouth opens in the cliffs south of Porthgaer. For perhaps two hours, it's possible to enter, wade through knee-deep water, and reach the shrine within—a natural chamber where fishermen have left offerings since before memory began.

The walls are covered with carvings. The oldest are worn almost smooth—fish shapes, spirals, figures with too many arms. Later carvings layer over them: Imperial-era inscriptions dedicating catches to officially approved saints, Solarian symbols that don't quite cover what lies beneath. The most recent carvings are post-Passing, and they're not Solarian at all.

**The Practice:** Before important fishing expeditions—the deep-water runs, the storm-season ventures—boats captains make the pilgrimage. They enter at low tide, leave an offering, speak their requests to whatever listens. The practice never stopped, not even during the Church's strictest periods. It simply became secret, passed from captain to captain, never written down.

**The Response:** Fishermen report that requests made in the shrine tend to be... noticed. Not always granted—the sea is capricious—but noticed. Boats whose captains visited tend to find fish more readily. Storms seem to miss them more often. Accidents happen less frequently.

Skeptics call this confirmation bias. Fishermen call it hedging bets. Something in the shrine calls it worship, and is pleased.

### The Hook

The tides are changing. The window to access the shrine has been growing longer—not minutes, but hours longer than it was a generation ago. More of the cave is becoming accessible. Deep in the darkness, where no one has been able to reach in living memory, lights have been seen moving.

---

## The Watching Stones (Meini'r Gwylio)

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Location** | A ridge overlooking the coastal road |
| **Type** | Ancient monument, liminal site |

### The Place

Seven standing stones crown a ridge above the main coastal road, positioned to be visible from miles in any direction. They're arranged in a rough arc, their flat faces all turned to watch the road below. Local tradition calls them the Sentinels, claiming they were warriors petrified for failing to defend against some ancient invasion.

The stones predate the Empire by unknown centuries. Their surfaces bear carvings worn almost invisible by weather—spirals, cup-marks, figures that might be human and might not. The Imperials, characteristically, ignored them. The Church, characteristically, tried to Christianize them with carved crosses. The crosses have worn away faster than the original carvings, as if the stone itself rejects them.

**The Effect:** Travelers report feeling watched when passing the stones—an uncomfortable sensation of being observed, evaluated, and found either acceptable or wanting. Those found acceptable pass without incident. Those found wanting... well, the stories vary. Lost travelers who walked in circles for days. Merchants whose goods mysteriously spoiled. Soldiers who arrived at their destination unable to remember why they'd come.

**Post-Passing:** The watching sensation has intensified. Some travelers now actively avoid the coastal road, adding days to their journeys. Others report the stones *speaking*—not in words, but in impressions, nudges toward certain paths or away from others. Whether this represents actual supernatural activity or collective psychological response to trauma is impossible to determine.

### The Hook

A merchant traveling the coastal road last month swears he saw an eighth stone—a new one, freshly raised, its surface unmarked. When he returned with witnesses, there were only seven. But the arc seemed different, somehow. As if the others had shifted to make room.

---

## The Wreckers' Coast (Traeth yr Ysglyfwyr)

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Location** | Treacherous stretch of shore north of Carreg Wen |
| **Type** | Dangerous waters, morally complicated history, current threat |

### The Place

The name tells the story. For generations, certain coastal communities supplemented their income by exploiting shipwrecks—some natural, some... encouraged. False lights on dangerous nights. Warnings that came too late or not at all. Boats that rushed out to "rescue" survivors who were subsequently never seen again.

The Empire tried to stop this. Garrisons were established, patrols conducted, perpetrators executed when caught. But the coast is long, the nights are dark, and the communities that depended on wrecking had centuries of practice at deception. The practice continued, more carefully.

**The Moral Complexity:** Not everyone involved was a simple murderer. Many wreckers drew clear lines—they would salvage cargo but rescue survivors, or only take from foreign ships, or only during genuine storms when vessels would have wrecked anyway. Others drew no lines at all. The same family might contain both types, and the community codes that governed wrecking were more elaborate than Imperial law ever achieved.

**Post-Passing:** The trade routes have collapsed; there's nothing to wreck. But the coast remains dangerous—rocks, currents, sudden storms—and since the Passing, the dangers have increased. Ships that shouldn't have wrecked have wrecked. Bodies that should have washed ashore have vanished. The Wreckers' Coast is earning its name through means that don't require human assistance anymore.

### The Hook

A trading ship from Tyrlóng, desperately off course, wrecked on the Wreckers' Coast three months ago. No survivors reached shore. But the wreck itself has become impossible to salvage—every attempt ends in equipment failure, injuries, or salvagers simply... turning back without knowing why. Something on that ship, or something that came with it, is guarding the wreck.

# Part Four: Key Figures

## Morwen Steelnet — Guildmaster of the Fishers' Brotherhood

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Full Name** | Morwen ferch Cadoc, called Steelnet |
| **Age** | 52 |
| **Role** | De facto ruler of Porthgaer |

### Character

Morwen earned her name young—she fell overboard in a storm and survived by clinging to a steel-cabled net for six hours in freezing water. She came out changed: harder, sharper, certain that survival is the only virtue that matters and sentiment is what drowns you.

She rose through the Brotherhood by competence and ruthlessness, becoming Guildmaster two years before the Passing. When the catastrophe hit, she was the one who made the hard decisions—rationing the grain stores, organizing the remaining boats, shooting the first looter herself. Porthgaer survived because Morwen kept it organized while larger cities dissolved into chaos.

**Personality:** Cold, practical, surprisingly fair. She doesn't play favorites; she simply identifies what needs doing and does it. Emotions are irrelevant. Complaints are irrelevant. The only question is: "Does this help us survive?"

**The Softness:** Her daughter Efa was among the first Reft victims. Morwen had her confined rather than destroyed, and visits her in the sealed room twice weekly. She reads to the thing that was her daughter, speaking as if Efa can still hear. These visits are the only time Morwen's iron facade shows cracks.

### Goal

Keep Porthgaer functioning until something better becomes possible. Morwen doesn't pretend the current arrangement is good—just that it's the best available. She dreams, privately, of reestablishing contact with the wider world, of trade routes reopening, of her city mattering again.

### Complication

The Brotherhood's younger members are restless. They see the power vacuum as opportunity, not crisis. Some want to expand aggressively—taking fishing grounds from weaker villages, establishing Porthgaer as a regional power. Others want to overthrow Morwen and implement more "progressive" policies. She juggles these factions while maintaining the exhausting pretense that everything is under control.

---

## Commander Aldric Stern — Last Imperial Officer

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Full Name** | Aldric Quintus Stern |
| **Age** | 47 |
| **Role** | Commander of the Porthgaer Garrison |

### Character

Aldric was a career soldier who never expected to matter. He served competently in minor postings, avoided politics, and was rewarded with command of Porthgaer's garrison—a backwater assignment meant as a gentle path to retirement. Then the Passing happened, and he discovered that backwaters survive when centers collapse.

He lost half his soldiers in the first month—plague, desertion, suicide. With the remainder, he sealed the Citadel, maintained discipline, and waited for orders that never came. Six years later, he's still waiting. The waiting has become the mission.

**Personality:** Rigid, melancholic, fundamentally decent. Aldric follows rules because rules are all he has left. The Empire gave him structure; without orders, he clings to the structure he knew, hoping that if he maintains form long enough, function will return.

**The Doubt:** He's increasingly certain the Empire is gone, that no orders will ever come, that his garrison serves no purpose except marking time until they die or disperse. He hasn't shared this with his soldiers. He can barely admit it to himself.

### Goal

Maintain the garrison and, through it, some fragment of Imperial order. If the Empire returns, he wants to have something to hand over. If it doesn't... he tries not to think about if it doesn't.

### Complication

His soldiers are aging out. The garrison is smaller each year—casualties, desertions, simple mortality. He cannot recruit replacements without acknowledging that the Empire isn't coming back, that he's building something new rather than preserving something old. This cognitive trap keeps him frozen, maintaining a holding pattern that cannot be sustained indefinitely.

---

## Sister Gwenith Wave-Walker — The Hidden Priestess

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Full Name** | Gwenith ferch Meredith, née Sister Gwenith of the Light |
| **Age** | 38 |
| **Role** | Keeper of the Old Ways, secretly |

### Character

Gwenith was ordained as a Solarian nun at sixteen, sent to serve at the Temple of the Light in Porthgaer at twenty. She was devout, sincere, convinced that the Church offered truth. Then she began listening to the fisherwives who came to her for confession—their stories, their beliefs, their quiet acknowledgment of powers older than the Church.

She didn't lose her faith; she expanded it. The Light is real, she believes, but it's not alone. The sea has its own divinity. The land remembers. The old gods never died—they simply waited. She serves all of them now, wearing Solarian robes while conducting rituals no bishop would recognize.

**Personality:** Serene, patient, more genuinely spiritual than any orthodoxy allows. Gwenith has found a faith that fits this coast, syncretizing Solarian teaching with folk practice and pre-Imperial tradition. She sees no contradiction; she believes all paths lead to truth.

**The Secret:** She's been teaching others. A loose network of "wave-walkers"—people who blend traditions, who serve the sea and the Light and whatever else answers when called—is growing along the coast. It's not organized enough to be called a movement. Yet.

### Goal

Guide her people through the crisis with spiritual tools that actually work. Orthodoxy failed during the Passing; the old ways didn't fail as badly. Gwenith wants to build something better—a faith that serves fishermen, that speaks to their lives, that doesn't require believing in an absent Church hierarchy.

### Complication

Father Cedric Long suspects her. He's not certain what she's doing, but he knows it's not orthodox, and his sense of duty wars with his practical recognition that what Gwenith provides actually helps people. If forced to choose between formal accusation and willful blindness, he'll struggle—and either choice will have consequences.

# Part Five: Local Conditions

## The Reft Situation

### Severity

**Rating:** Moderate, with concerning trends.

The Hintercoast's scattered population and relative isolation meant fewer initial Reft conversions than the densely populated south. The fishing communities had natural defenses—boats to flee on, sea between settlements, limited travel keeping contamination contained.

However, the Reft present in the region are *different*.

### Predominant Types

| Type | Prevalence | Notes |
|------|------------|-------|
| **Drowned Reft** | High | This coast breeds them; some seem to emerge from the sea itself |
| **Root Reft** | Moderate | Found near forest edges and in abandoned farmland |
| **Shadow Reft** | Low but increasing | More sightings in caves and deep forest |
| **Empty Reft** | Rare but present | Reported near the Drowned Forest |

### Distribution

**Concentrations:**
- The Drowned Forest and its surrounding shallows
- Abandoned fishing villages (several small communities simply vanished during the Passing)
- The forests inland from the coast
- Certain stretches of coastal road

**Safe Zones:**
- Active fishing villages (constant human activity deters Reft)
- The fortified settlements (Porthgaer, Castell Môr)
- Open water (the Reft don't swim, except the Drowned type)

### The Drowned Reft Problem

The coast produces a variety of Reft that isn't well documented elsewhere. Drowned Reft emerge from the sea—sometimes washed-up corpses of sailors, sometimes bodies that shouldn't have been in the water at all. They're slow on land but relentless in water, and they seem drawn to boats.

**Concerning Development:** The Drowned Reft are becoming more coordinated. Where they once wandered randomly, they now seem to gather at certain points, as if waiting for something. Several boats have been swarmed by groups acting in disturbing concert.

## Travel

### By Sea

The safest option, ironically. The Reft can't cross open water (the Drowned type excepted), and boats move faster than anything on land. Coastal fishing boats serve as the primary transportation network, hopping between villages, carrying passengers and cargo.

**Limitations:**
- Weather-dependent; winter storms make sea travel suicidal
- The Drowned Reft make night sailing dangerous
- Many boats were lost during the Passing; capacity is limited
- No deep-water vessels remain; travel beyond the coast is impossible

### By Land

Dangerous but sometimes necessary. The coastal road connects the settlements but passes through areas where Reft concentrate.

**The Coastal Road:** Once Imperial-maintained, now deteriorating. Passable by foot or horse; carts struggle in places. The Watching Stones stretch makes travelers uneasy. The stretch near the Drowned Forest is actively dangerous.

**Inland Routes:** Mostly abandoned. The forests have become hostile; the few remaining paths lead through territory that's no longer safe.

### Practical Patterns

- Most people stay home
- Essential travel happens by boat when possible
- Land travel occurs in groups, armed, during daylight only
- Nobody travels alone if they can avoid it
- Information spreads slowly; news from beyond the Hintercoast arrives weeks or months late

## Trade

### What the Hintercoast Produces

| Product | Source | Demand |
|---------|--------|--------|
| **Fish** | The entire coast | Universal—the primary food source |
| **Salt** | Aberheli | Essential for preservation |
| **Rope and Nets** | Porthgaer | Necessary for fishing |
| **Wool** | Inland farms (reduced) | Clothing, sails |
| **Lumber** | Coastal forests (dangerous) | Boats, building |

### What the Hintercoast Needs

| Need | Former Source | Current Status |
|------|---------------|----------------|
| **Metal goods** | Portus Aureus trade | Scarce; recycling old equipment |
| **Grain** | Heartland trade | Very scarce; small local production insufficient |
| **Medicine** | Portus Aureus | Almost nonexistent |
| **Luxury goods** | Everywhere | Irrelevant now |
| **News** | Imperial network | Sporadic, unreliable |

### Trade Networks

**Internal:** The fishing villages trade among themselves—fish for salt, salt for rope, rope for labor. A barter economy has emerged, complex and relationship-based.

**External:** Limited contact with Portus Aureus remains. Occasionally, a trader makes the dangerous coastal journey, bringing metal goods, medicine, news. These traders are received like visiting royalty, their goods worth almost anything.

**Control:** The Fishers' Brotherhood controls most trade through Porthgaer. This gives Guildmaster Morwen significant leverage, which she uses sparingly and carefully.

## Religion

### Official Practice

The Solarian Church maintains a presence. Father Cedric Long leads services at the Temple of the Light in Porthgaer; smaller chapels exist in most settlements. Attendance has actually *increased* since the Passing—crisis drives people to seek comfort.

**But:** What people actually believe has diverged from what the Church teaches. Father Cedric knows this. He's chosen to focus on pastoral care rather than doctrinal enforcement, calculating that community survival matters more than orthodoxy.

### Actual Practice

| Tradition | Status | Centers |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| **Solarian (Orthodox)** | Declining | Porthgaer Temple, official ceremonies |
| **Solarian (Adapted)** | Growing | Father Cedric's flexible approach |
| **Folk Traditions** | Resurgent | Standing Stone, sea-shrines, home altars |
| **Wave-Walker Syncretism** | Emerging | Sister Gwenith's network |
| **Atargatan Elements** | Present | Fishing communities, especially older families |
| **Ostaran Ancestor Work** | Present | The Sailors' Graveyard, home practices |

### The Theological Situation

The Passing broke something in people's relationship with the Light. The Church promised protection; protection didn't come. Now, people are exploring—quietly, carefully—what else might offer help.

The fishing communities have always maintained folk practices alongside Church attendance. Now, those folk practices are becoming primary. Offerings to sea-spirits. Consultations with the Speaking Caves. Ancestor work that the Church calls necromancy but that fishermen call "asking Grandad about the weather."

This isn't organized. It's not rebellious. It's simply practical—people doing what seems to work, doctrine be damned.

## The Scars

### The Calling Deeps

**Location:** A stretch of sea north of Castell Môr.
**Manifestation:** Sounds from beneath the water. Songs, sometimes. Voices calling names.
**Effect:** Sailors who hear the calling tend to stare into the water. Some have been found dead, drowned in their own boats, faces peaceful.
**Avoidance:** Boats sail around this stretch when possible, adding hours to journeys.

### The Still Bay

**Location:** A small inlet between Porthgaer and Aberheli.
**Manifestation:** The water here never moves. No waves, no current, no tide. The surface is mirror-smooth regardless of weather.
**Effect:** Boats that enter drift without progress, their crews reporting profound lethargy and difficulty thinking. Several boats have been found here with dead crews who simply... stopped.
**Avoidance:** Absolute. The inlet is marked on charts as forbidden.

### The Remembering Shore

**Location:** A beach near Carreg Wen.
**Manifestation:** Visitors experience intense memories—not their own. Walking the sand triggers flashes of other lives, other deaths, experiences that don't belong to them.
**Effect:** Usually distressing; sometimes useful (some claim to have learned things from the memories). Prolonged exposure causes identity confusion.
**Local Response:** The beach has become a pilgrimage site for those seeking to remember lost loved ones. Results are unpredictable.

# Part Six: Adventure Hooks

## The Messenger from Nowhere

A fishing boat pulls a drowning man from the sea. He carries a sealed message addressed to "The Authority of the Eastern Coast"—formal diplomatic language, archaic style, written on materials that haven't been manufactured in living memory. The man himself can't explain where he came from; his memories begin when he hit the water. But he insists the message is vital, that something is coming, that the coast must be warned.

**The Complications:**
- The message is in an older dialect that requires translation
- Its contents reference places and powers that don't match current political reality
- Someone else wants the message—agents have arrived from Portus Aureus, claiming Imperial authority that may or may not be real
- The messenger himself is experiencing returning memories, each more disturbing than the last

---

## The Catch of the Century

A fishing crew brings up something extraordinary in their nets—a chest, sealed with wax and bronze, clearly centuries old, containing artifacts of obvious value and unclear purpose. The crew can't agree on what to do: turn it over to authorities (which authorities?), sell it to the highest bidder, investigate what they've found, or throw it back into the sea.

**The Complications:**
- The artifacts are religious objects, but from no tradition anyone recognizes
- A symbol on the chest matches carvings in the Fishermen's Shrine
- Since the catch was landed, the crew has been having shared dreams—the same dreams, night after night
- Word has spread; interested parties are converging on Porthgaer

---

## The Empty Village

Fishermen report that Porthdulas, a small village up the coast, hasn't been showing lights at night. A cautious investigation finds the village empty—no bodies, no signs of violence, no explanation. Food sits rotting on tables; boats float unmanned in the harbor; beds are unmade as if people simply vanished mid-routine.

**The Complications:**
- One survivor is found: a child hidden in a root cellar, unable to speak and apparently in shock
- The village's nets, left in the water, have been catching strange things
- Someone—or something—has begun ringing the village's chapel bell each night
- The Reft haven't touched the village, which is itself deeply suspicious

---

## The Treaty of Old

Sister Gwenith approaches trusted individuals with an unusual request. Ancient records suggest that the pre-Imperial people of this coast signed a treaty with... something in the sea. The treaty established boundaries, obligations, protections. The Church destroyed the records, but Gwenith believes the treaty itself may still be binding—and that the sea's increasing hostility may result from humanity's forgotten obligations.

**The Complications:**
- Finding information requires delving into sites the Church suppressed—the Speaking Caves, the Drowned Forest, places no sensible person enters
- If the treaty exists, re-establishing it may require acts that modern morality considers barbaric
- Not everyone wants the treaty found; the Wreckers' descendants have their own relationship with the sea, and it doesn't involve treaties
- Something in the sea seems to be *listening*, and its attention is not comfortable

---

## The Eighth Stone

A traveler arrives in Porthgaer with a wild claim: he saw an eighth Watching Stone being raised—emerging from the earth, pushing upward, growing into position as if alive. He further claims the new stone spoke to him, giving him a message for "those who would survive what comes."

**The Complications:**
- The message is cryptic: "The forgotten sister wakes. The water remembers. Stand or drown."
- Investigating the Watching Stones reveals they've all shifted slightly, their faces now turned toward the sea rather than the road
- The traveler begins manifesting strange abilities—knowing things he shouldn't, predicting events before they happen
- The Watching Stones' new orientation points toward something in the ocean, something that wasn't there before but is approaching
