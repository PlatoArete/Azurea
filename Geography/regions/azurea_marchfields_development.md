# Azurea: Marchfields Sub-Region Development
## Regio Limitanea — The Borders

---

# Overview

The Marchfields is the Heartland's frontier zone—not a single border but rather the collective term for all the Empire's defensive buffer territories where Imperial civilization meets the wilder regions. Three distinct "marches" fall under this administration: the Western March (facing the Kingswood), the Northern March (facing the mountains), and the Southmarch (facing the transitional zone toward Dragon-kin lands).

**Imperial Name:** Regio Limitanea
**Local Name:** The Borders / The Marches
**Capital:** Castrum Novum
**City Density:** Moderate (1 major city per ~120 miles)
**Character:** Military-colonial settlements, fortress-towns, supply depots, and border watchtowers

---

# Part One: The Capital — Castrum Novum

## Overview

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Imperial Name** | Castrum Novum |
| **Meaning** | "New Fort" |
| **Local Names** | "The New Fort" (formal), "Novum" (common), "The Camp" (soldiers' slang) |
| **Location** | Strategic crossroads where roads to all three marches converge |
| **Pre-Passing Population** | ~65,000 |
| **Post-Passing Population** | ~35,000 |

## History

Castrum Novum began three centuries ago as exactly what its name suggests—a new fort. The Empire had outgrown its original frontier defenses; the old fortress at Castrum Vetus (now a ruin thirty miles east) could no longer effectively coordinate military operations across the expanding border regions.

The site was chosen for its position at the junction of three military roads: the Via Occidentalis (leading to the Kingswood border), the Via Montana (leading to the northern passes), and the Via Meridiana Militaris (the military spur toward the southern approaches). What began as a legionary headquarters gradually accumulated civilian support—merchants, craftsmen, camp followers, families. Over two centuries, the camp became a town, and the town became a city.

Unlike most Imperial cities that grew from commercial or religious centers, Castrum Novum remains fundamentally military in character. The civilian population exists to support the garrison; the garrison does not exist to protect the civilians. This distinction matters.

## Geography and Layout

The city occupies a low plateau where three valleys converge—a natural amphitheater of gently rising ground with excellent sight lines in all directions. The original fortress sits at the highest point; the city has grown down the slopes in concentric rings.

### The Four Quarters

**The Praetorium (The Command)**

The original fortress, expanded over centuries into a fortified administrative complex.

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **The Commander's Palace** | Austere military headquarters, nothing decorative |
| **The Strategium** | Map rooms, intelligence archives, communication center |
| **The Armory-Cathedral** | Combined arsenal and Church of the Military Saints |
| **The Signal Tower** | Tallest structure in the city; beacon system connecting all frontier posts |
| **The Hall of Standards** | Where the Eagles of the frontier legions are kept |

The Praetorium is technically open to civilians but practically isn't—the guards at every gate discourage casual visitors.

**The Annona (The Supply Quarter)**

The military logistics district. The name comes from the grain tax that once fed the legions.

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **The Great Warehouses** | Grain, preserved meat, military supplies |
| **The Imperial Smithies** | Arms and armor production, strictly controlled |
| **The Horse-Yards** | Cavalry stables and remount stations |
| **The Hospital of Mars** | Military medical facility, largest in the frontier |
| **The Quartermaster's Courts** | Where supply contracts are awarded (and fortunes made) |

This is where the real power lies. Whoever controls supplies controls the army.

**The Canabae (The Camp-Town)**

The civilian settlement that grew up around the fortress.

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **The Via Principalis** | Main commercial street, paved with military precision |
| **The Soldier's Rest** | District of taverns, brothels, and entertainment |
| **The Marriage Quarter** | Where soldiers' unofficial families live |
| **The Veterans' District** | Retired soldiers with land grants in the region |
| **The Refugee Camps** | Post-Passing addition; shanties outside the original walls |

The Canabae has always been rowdy, practical, and oddly egalitarian. When everyone's husband or father might die on the frontier, class distinctions seem less important.

**The Vicus Peregrinus (The Strangers' Quarter)**

Where non-Imperial peoples live and trade.

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **The Western Enclave** | Traders from the Kingswood, permitted despite suspicion |
| **The Mountain House** | Axis Faith dwarves with legitimate trade goods |
| **The Southern Compound** | Dragon-kin merchants and their human associates |
| **The Chapel of All Saints** | Church-approved worship space for foreign traditions (heavily monitored) |
| **The Interpreter's Guild** | Essential for frontier diplomacy and intelligence |

The Church never trusted this quarter, but the military insisted on maintaining it. You can't negotiate with peoples you refuse to meet.

## Landmarks

**The Triumphal Gate**

Where the three military roads converge before entering the city. Three separate arches, each carved with the victories won on its respective frontier. The Western Arch shows scenes of forest pacification; the Northern Arch depicts mountain campaigns; the Southern Arch celebrates... diplomatic achievements (the Dragon-kin were never actually conquered).

Post-Passing, the gate's ironwork has been reinforced, and the arches can be sealed independently. The carvings have been damaged by Reft attacks and pocked with the scars of desperate fighting.

**The Muster Fields**

A vast open space south of the city where armies traditionally assembled before campaigns. Large enough to hold forty thousand soldiers in formation. Now partially occupied by refugee camps and temporary livestock pens.

The Muster Fields contain the **Stone of Oaths**—a granite block where officers traditionally swore loyalty to the Emperor before marching. No one has sworn there since the Passing. The stone is said to weep in morning fog, though this is probably condensation.

**The Memorial Mile**

The first mile of the Via Occidentalis, lined with monuments to soldiers who fell in the western campaigns. Each monument is a stone pillar with the names of the dead from a particular action. There are 847 pillars.

Post-Passing, new pillars are being added. There isn't room for them all. Some are just wooden posts with names scratched in charcoal.

**The Listening Post**

A tower on the western edge of the city, built over a spring sacred to pre-Imperial peoples. The water was believed to carry whispers from the forest. The Church tried to consecrate it; the whispers continued. Now it serves as an early warning station—interpreters sit in shifts, listening to the water, reporting anything that sounds like words.

Since the Kingswood closed, the whispers have changed. They're no longer in any human language.

**The Forum Militum**

An open-air assembly space where frontier business is conducted: trials, announcements, contract awards, public punishments. A statue of the Emperor once dominated the center; it was pulled down during the chaos following the Passing and hasn't been replaced. The empty plinth remains, covered in competing graffiti claiming authority in various names.

## Who Rules

**The Official Answer:** The Praefectus Limitum (Prefect of the Borders), appointed by the Emperor to coordinate all frontier defenses.

**The Practical Answer:** That office is now meaningless. Three power centers compete:

| Power Center | Leader | Character |
|--------------|--------|-----------|
| **The Garrison Command** | Legatus Marcian Severus | Professional soldier, maintains Imperial loyalty in theory |
| **The Supply Administration** | Praefectus Annonae Lucia Granis | Controls food and material; de facto most powerful |
| **The March Commanders** | Various | Three separate officers commanding the three frontiers |

Marcian Severus officially commands the city. Lucia Granis actually runs it. The March Commanders do what they want in their own territories and visit Castrum Novum only when forced to.

## The Tension

**The Central Conflict:** The three March Commanders want autonomy to pursue their own frontier strategies. The city administration wants unified command. No one is certain the city has the authority to enforce obedience—and no one wants to find out by testing it.

**Secondary Tensions:**
- The refugee population strains resources meant for military operations
- The Church faction (Armory-Cathedral priests) claims spiritual authority over military conduct
- The Quartermaster's officers are clearly profiteering from the crisis
- Veterans with land grants are being pressured to contribute "emergency levies"
- The Strangers' Quarter residents are blamed for everything that goes wrong

## Atmosphere

Castrum Novum feels like a military camp that's pretended to be a city for so long it almost believes it. Everything is organized on a grid. Streets are numbered, not named. Buildings are functional rather than beautiful.

**Sounds:** Marching feet (constant), smith-hammers (constant), horn signals (regular), the shouting of drill sergeants (dawn to dusk).

**Smells:** Horse dung, leather oil, woodsmoke, the sulfur of the smithies, and underneath it all, the particular funk of too many soldiers in too small a space.

**The Mood:** Tense, watchful, professionally calm. These are people who've lived on the frontier long enough to know that panic kills. Problems are addressed with logistics, not emotions.

# Part Two: Secondary Settlements

## 2.1 Castra Silvae — The Forest Fort

**Location:** Western March, on the edge of the Kingswood
**Imperial Name:** Castra Silvae ("Forest Camp")
**Local Name:** Silvae, "The Trees"
**Population:** Pre-Passing ~18,000 / Post-Passing ~8,000

### Character

The westernmost fortress of the Marchfields, positioned where the Via Occidentalis meets the ancient boundary of the Kingswood. For centuries, Castra Silvae served as the checkpoint through which all legitimate traffic to and from the forest passed. Merchants, pilgrims (to older shrines, grudgingly tolerated), and occasionally diplomatic missions to the Duke of Caerderw all came through here.

The fortress itself is notably different from standard Imperial military architecture. The original builders quickly learned that pure stone walls seemed to offend something in the forest—they would crack, roots would grow through them, birds would nest so thickly that sentries couldn't see. The current fortifications are a hybrid: stone foundations with heavy timber superstructures, ivy permitted to grow (it seems to satisfy *something*), and no iron exposed to the forest-facing side.

### Layout

**The Gate-Fort** — The main fortress, straddling the road
**The Customs Yard** — Where goods were inspected and taxed
**The Interpreter's Station** — Where forest-folk dealt with Imperial authorities
**The Chapel of the Threshold** — Dual-purpose; Light services inside, offerings left outside for "local saints"
**The Watchers' Walk** — Elevated wooden platforms giving views into the tree-line

### Current State

The Kingswood closed after the Passing. The paths that worked for centuries now lead in circles or simply end. No one enters; nothing comes out.

Castra Silvae has gone from checkpoint to siege-line. The soldiers don't know what they're besieging. They don't know if anything is actually threatening them. But the forest feels *wrong* now—darker, quieter, occasionally producing sounds that don't match any known animal.

**Commander:** Tribune Caia Frondis, third-generation frontier officer. Her grandmother negotiated with the forest-folk; her mother maintained the old arrangements. Caia knows the protocols that used to work. None of them work anymore.

**The Problem:** Soldiers are disappearing. Not killed by Reft—there are no bodies. They simply walk toward the treeline and never return. It happens about once a month. Caia has ordered that no one approaches within a hundred yards of the forest edge without a tether. The tethers have been cut three times.

### Notable Feature

**The Devil's Door:** An old church, part of the Chapel of the Threshold complex, has a north-facing door that was supposed to be sealed according to Church doctrine. It never was. Forest-folk used it to attend services in the old days. Now it's the only door that doesn't jam, warp, or rot. The priests are terrified of it. The soldiers use it constantly.

---

## 2.2 Castra Montium — The Mountain Fort

**Location:** Northern March, guarding the main pass to Nordgard
**Imperial Name:** Castra Montium ("Mountain Camp")
**Local Name:** "The Heights," "Montium"
**Population:** Pre-Passing ~12,000 / Post-Passing ~6,000

### Character

Built where the Via Montana begins its climb into the Axis range, Castra Montium guards the primary route between the Heartland and the North. Unlike Castra Silvae (which managed a porous border with ambiguous neighbors), Castra Montium dealt with clear, defined relationships: dwarven traders coming down, Imperial goods going up, tolls collected both ways.

The fortress architecture is notably dwarven-influenced. Korvathrim engineers consulted on the original construction; the foundations go deep into bedrock, the stonework is precise beyond human capability, and the heating system (geothermal vents channeled through the floors) still functions after two centuries.

### Layout

**The Pass-Gate** — Massive structure blocking the valley
**The Toll-Houses** — Revenue collection and customs inspection
**The Dwarf-Quarter** — Permanent Axis Faith trading presence
**The Caravan-Yards** — Rest and resupply for mountain traffic
**The Signal Station** — Mirror-tower communication with the northern peaks

### Current State

The Axis Faith dwarves retreated to their mountains after the Passing. Trade hasn't stopped entirely, but it's reduced to perhaps a tenth of former volume. The economic basis of the town has collapsed.

What remains is pure military function. The pass still needs guarding—not from dwarves (who remain friendly, if distant) but from what might come through the mountains. The Passing affected the high peaks strangely. Travelers who make it through report wrong echoes, slopes that change angle when you're not looking, and things moving in avalanche debris.

**Commander:** Prefect Magnus Saxum, an older officer who should have retired years ago. He stayed because he genuinely likes the dwarves and thought they'd return to normal trade soon. They haven't. He's increasingly isolated, sending requests for clarification to Castrum Novum that receive contradictory answers.

**The Problem:** Something is living in the pass now. The sentries hear stone moving at night—not rockfall, but deliberate movement. The dwarves who still trade refuse to discuss it. One elderly Mukir, deeply drunk, told Magnus: "The mountain is remembering what it was before we carved it."

### Notable Feature

**The Covenant Stone:** A boundary marker established in the ancient peace between Empire and Axis Faith. The treaty is carved in both Latin and Dwarven. The Empire promised to claim no mineral rights beyond this point; the dwarves promised free passage through the mountains. Both promises have been kept.

Post-Passing, someone has added a third text in a language no one recognizes. The new carving appears each night, erasing anything done to remove it. It's growing longer. The dwarven traders claim not to know what it says. They're lying.

---

## 2.3 Finis Terrae — Land's End

**Location:** Southern March, facing the transitional zone to Dragon-kin territory
**Imperial Name:** Finis Terrae ("End of the Land")
**Local Name:** "The End," "Terrae"
**Population:** Pre-Passing ~15,000 / Post-Passing ~10,000

### Character

The southernmost Imperial settlement of the Marchfields, positioned where fertile Heartland gives way to the older, stranger lands where Dragon-kin have held sway since before humans arrived. Despite the ominous name, Finis Terrae was always more trading post than fortress. The Dragon-kin were never enemies in the way forest-folk or mountain peoples sometimes were. They were simply... other.

The architecture reflects this ambiguity. The northern half of the town is standard Imperial provincial—brick, tile, right angles. The southern half gradually transitions to Dragon-kin aesthetic: curved roofs, fire-vents, scales carved into stonework. The two halves meet at a marketplace that belongs to neither style.

### Layout

**The Market of Smoke** — Main trading space, named for the cooking fires of a dozen cuisines
**The Imperial Quarter** — Standard colonial administration
**The Scaled Houses** — Dragon-kin merchant compounds
**The Archive of Accords** — Records of every treaty, contract, and agreement between human and Dragon-kin authorities
**The Temple of the Sleeping Fire** — A joint sacred space that somehow satisfies both Solarian and Draconic theology

### Current State

The Dragon-kin withdrew after the Passing—not aggressively, simply *inward*. The great Dragon cities to the south closed their gates to human visitors. Trade continued but mediated entirely through Finis Terrae; no Imperial citizen has been permitted further south in seven years.

The town has become a listening post. What little intelligence reaches the Empire from the Dragonlands passes through here. The Dragon-kin merchants still trade, but they've become uniformly tight-lipped about conditions in their homeland.

**Commander:** Praefectus Aelia Calor, a diplomatic officer rather than a warrior. She speaks three Dragon-kin languages and has spent thirty years building relationships with southern traders. Those relationships are what's keeping the town functional.

**The Problem:** Something is wrong in the Dragon-kin lands. The traders won't discuss it directly, but Aelia has pieced together fragments: internal conflict between the Three Houses, possibly related to disagreements about how to respond to the Passing. The Mush-Nāga (priest-kings) want isolation; the Lóng-Imperiales (administrators) want engagement; the Tiān-Phanes (philosophers) want... something else. There are rumors of a schism.

If the Dragon-kin fall into civil war, the southern frontier becomes something other than a trade border.

### Notable Feature

**The Temple of the Sleeping Fire:** A unique structure built by joint human-Dragon-kin effort centuries ago. The exterior appears to be a standard Solarian church. The interior contains a fire-pit that has never been allowed to die—the "Sleeping Fire" that gives the temple its name. Dragon-kin say it's a fragment of the Deep Fire where their ancestors dream. Church doctrine claims it's a holy flame blessed by Saint Aldric. Both groups worship there on different days. Neither acknowledges the other's interpretation.

The fire has been burning differently since the Passing. It's still alight—but the color has shifted, and the shadows it casts seem to move independently.

---

## 2.4 Vigilia — The Watch

**Location:** Central Marchfields, equidistant from all three borders
**Imperial Name:** Vigilia ("The Watch")
**Local Name:** "The Hub"
**Population:** Pre-Passing ~8,000 / Post-Passing ~5,000

### Character

Not a fortress but a communication and logistics hub. Vigilia exists because messages and supplies need to move between Castrum Novum and the three march-forts, and there needed to be somewhere in the middle where routes could be adjusted, cargoes redistributed, and couriers could change horses.

The town is architecturally unremarkable—way-stations, warehouses, stables, and the necessary support services. Its importance lies entirely in its position.

### Layout

**The Signal Tower** — Central element, visible for miles
**The Courier Station** — Where message routes coordinate
**The Redistribution Yards** — Supplies sorted and redirected
**The Common Inn** — Largest building in town; everyone passes through
**The Shrine of Mercury** — Patron of travelers, communication, and (unofficially) thieves

### Current State

Vigilia has become more important since the Passing, not less. With the roads dangerous and Reft wandering the countryside, coordinated movement is essential. The town has effectively militarized—what was once a civilian logistics operation is now under army control.

**Commander:** Stationmaster Decius Velox, a former cavalry officer whose injured leg ended his field career. He runs Vigilia with the precision of a military operation and the paranoia of someone who knows exactly how exposed his position is.

**The Problem:** Someone is intercepting messages. Not all of them—just enough to notice. Couriers arrive to find their dispatch bags have been opened and resealed. Sometimes the messages inside have been altered in subtle ways. Decius has implemented new security protocols, but the interceptions continue. He suspects one of the march-forts is running its own intelligence operation against the others.

### Notable Feature

**The Shrine of Mercury:** Officially a minor Solarian chapel dedicated to the "saint" of travelers. In practice, it's a thieves' temple. The criminal networks that operated across the frontier used Vigilia as neutral ground; the shrine was where deals were made, oaths sworn, disputes arbitrated.

Post-Passing, the criminal networks collapsed along with legitimate trade. But the shrine remains—and someone still leaves offerings. Fresh offerings. Decius pretends not to notice. Whatever's using the shrine isn't causing trouble, and he has enough real problems.

# Part Three: Notable Sites

## 3.1 The Limes Occidentalis — The Western Wall

**Type:** Military fortification network
**Location:** A chain of watchtowers, signal stations, and small forts running along the Kingswood border

### Description

Not a continuous wall but a system—watchtowers visible to each other, small garrisons at day-march intervals, patrol routes connecting them. Built over two centuries as the Empire's answer to the question: "How do you contain a forest that doesn't want to be contained?"

The Limes was never meant to stop an invasion. The forest-folk don't invade. It was meant to control traffic: knowing who entered, who left, what they carried. And it worked, mostly, for generations.

### Current State

Abandoned south of Castra Silvae. The garrisons couldn't be maintained after the Passing, and the forest seemed to be eating the structures anyway—trees growing through walls, roots undermining foundations. The remaining towers north of the fortress are manned by skeleton crews who increasingly report that their relief patrols don't arrive.

**The Significance:** The Limes represents Imperial confidence—the belief that the forest could be managed, monitored, understood. Its collapse represents the loss of that confidence.

**The Mystery:** Some towers south of Castra Silvae are still signaling. Brief flashes of light at night, following the old codes. No one is supposed to be there. Tribune Frondis has forbidden response signals. She doesn't want to know who—or what—is using Imperial codes from inside the closed forest.

---

## 3.2 Castrum Vetus — The Old Fort

**Type:** Ruin
**Location:** Thirty miles east of Castrum Novum

### History

The original frontier headquarters, abandoned when Castrum Novum was built. For centuries it served as a quarry, a shepherd's shelter, a lovers' meeting place, and a cautionary example for officers who let their postings decay.

### Current State

The Reft have claimed it. Not just passing through—*inhabiting* it. Hundreds of them, perhaps thousands, milling through the ruins with terrible parodies of military discipline. They wear corroded armor pulled from old supply caches. They respond to horn signals—not modern ones, but patterns that haven't been used in centuries.

**The Commander:** There appears to be something leading them. Scouts report seeing a figure on the old gatehouse, standing motionless for hours, wearing a general's cloak that crumbled decades ago. When it moves, the Reft move with it.

**The Danger:** Castrum Vetus is only thirty miles from Castrum Novum. The Reft there haven't attacked in force yet. But they're drilling. They're organizing. Something is preparing them for something.

**The Mystery:** The Reft at Castrum Vetus are all Storm Reft—Peaks-field contamination. There's no obvious reason why this type would concentrate here, so far from any mountains.

---

## 3.3 The Giant's Fingers

**Type:** Geographic feature / possible sleeping giant remnant
**Location:** Northern Marchfields, visible from Castra Montium

### Description

Five stone pillars rising from a hillside, each roughly 200 feet tall, arranged in a pattern unmistakably suggesting a hand emerging from the earth. Local legend has always claimed it's exactly what it appears to be—a giant buried up to his wrist during the God-Giant War.

The Church officially designated the feature "The Five Saints' Markers" and attributed natural geological origin. No one in the region uses that name.

### Current State

Since the Passing, the fingers have been *moving*. Not dramatically—perhaps an inch per year. But they're uncurling. Slowly. Imperceptibly to casual observation.

The local population is terrified. The priests insist nothing is happening. The garrison at Castra Montium has quietly begun evacuating families from the surrounding villages.

**The Mystery:** A shepherd claims he fell asleep against one of the fingers and dreamed of being buried alive, crushed under mountains, filled with rage so old it had forgotten what it was angry about. He woke screaming and refuses to approach within a mile. Others have reported similar dreams.

---

## 3.4 The Burnt Offering

**Type:** Anomalous site / Passing-scar
**Location:** Southern Marchfields, three days' ride from Finis Terrae

### Description

During the Passing, one of the eldritch things passed directly over this area. It didn't stop. It didn't seem to notice the terrain. But where its shadow fell, everything burned.

A perfect circular area, half a mile across, where everything living—trees, grass, insects, people in one small village—simply combusted. The soil is fused glass. The air still tastes of ash seven years later.

### Current State

The circle won't heal. Rain falls on it but evaporates before reaching the ground. Seeds blown onto its surface burst into flame. The glass surface shows no weathering.

Animals avoid it instinctively. Reft have been observed walking to its edge and stopping, turning, finding another route. Whatever happened there repels even the corrupted.

**The Mystery:** At the exact center of the circle, something survived. A stone marker, older than the Empire, bearing inscriptions in Dragon-kin script. The Dragon-kin traders claim ignorance when asked about it, but Aelia Calor has noticed that they avoid looking in the direction of the Burnt Offering when they're in Finis Terrae.

The inscription has been tentatively translated: "Here the dreamers touched the sky."

# Part Four: Key Figures

## 4.1 Legatus Marcian Severus

**Role:** Military Commander of Castrum Novum
**Age:** 53
**Origin:** Old military family from the Lawlands

### Character

A soldier's soldier—promoted through competence rather than connections, respected by his troops, uncomfortable with politics. Marcian has served on every frontier during his career. He knows how to fight enemies. He doesn't know how to navigate the current crisis, where enemies and allies have become indistinguishable.

**Appearance:** Weathered, scarred, habitually wearing armor even in administrative settings. Gray-streaked hair cut military short. Missing two fingers on his left hand from a Kingswood campaign twenty years ago.

### Goal

Maintain Imperial military effectiveness until legitimate authority can be restored. Marcian genuinely believes the Empire will recover, that the Emperor (or a proper successor) will emerge, that orders will eventually come from Aurheim. He's holding the frontier in trust.

### Complication

His faith in the system prevents him from exercising the authority he actually has. He waits for orders that don't come, defers to institutional processes that no longer function, and allows subordinates to act independently because he lacks clear direction to constrain them.

The March Commanders increasingly ignore him. The supply administration increasingly works around him. He has power he won't use—and the power is eroding because he won't use it.

### Secret

Marcian receives dreams from the Giant's Fingers. Not as often as the shepherd, but regularly. He dreams of waking up trapped, of screaming without sound, of fingers slowly uncurling. He hasn't told anyone. He's terrified that if word spread, he'd be removed from command—and then who would hold the frontier?

---

## 4.2 Praefectus Annonae Lucia Granis

**Role:** Head of Supply Administration
**Age:** 44
**Origin:** Merchant family from Grannaria (distant relations to the Grain-Masters' Guild)

### Character

Brilliant, ruthless, utterly pragmatic. Lucia rose through the supply corps by being better at logistics than anyone else and more willing to cut necessary deals. She has no military training, no noble connections, and no patience for institutional niceties.

She controls food, equipment, and transport. In a functioning system, this would make her a powerful bureaucrat. In the current crisis, it makes her the most powerful person in the Marchfields.

**Appearance:** Well-fed (a political statement—she has access to food), expensively dressed in civilian clothing, never armed. Carries an abacus instead of a sword.

### Goal

Survive. Not just personally—survive as the head of a functional supply system that she can leverage into lasting power. Lucia sees the current chaos as an opportunity. If she positions herself correctly, she could emerge as an essential figure in whatever new order develops.

### Complication

She's profiteering—she admits this freely, claiming it's the only way to maintain supply networks. But her profiteering has enriched her family and cronies while frontier garrisons go hungry. The March Commanders hate her. Marcian disapproves but can't function without her. The common soldiers, if they ever got access to her ledgers, might riot.

She's also genuinely good at her job. Supplies flow better under her management than they ever did under her predecessors. The Marchfields would probably collapse without her. She knows this. Everyone knows this. It doesn't make them hate her less.

### Secret

She's been in contact with Grannaria. Her family connections have established a separate supply line that bypasses Castrum Novum entirely—goods moving directly between the Granary City and her personal warehouses. She's building a power base independent of the frontier military structure.

---

## 4.3 Tribune Caia Frondis

**Role:** Commander of Castra Silvae
**Age:** 38
**Origin:** Third-generation frontier officer family

### Character

Caia inherited her grandmother's understanding of the Kingswood and her mother's sense of duty. She knows the old protocols, the old agreements, the subtle signs that indicated forest-folk mood. None of this knowledge helps anymore.

The forest has become something she doesn't recognize. The careful relationships her family built over three generations appear to mean nothing. She's guarding a border against an enemy that won't negotiate, won't fight, and won't explain what it wants.

**Appearance:** Lean, watchful, habitually glances at the treeline even indoors. Wears her grandmother's ring—iron, which forest-folk avoid, but decorated with oak leaves, which they once accepted as a sign of respect. Neither symbol means anything now.

### Goal

Understand what happened to the Kingswood. Re-establish communication with whoever or whatever now controls the forest. Find some way to stop her soldiers from disappearing.

### Complication

She's emotionally invested in a forest that may no longer exist in any form she can relate to. Her expertise has become a liability—she keeps trying old approaches because she can't accept that the old relationship is dead. Every failed attempt demoralizes her command and delays more aggressive defensive measures that might actually work.

### Secret

Her grandmother's journals, which she inherited, contain references to something called the "Waking Protocol"—instructions for what to do if the forest ever "woke up." The journals are incomplete; pages have been torn out. Caia is searching for the missing sections, but she doesn't know who removed them or why.

---

# Part Five: Local Conditions

## The Reft Situation

The Marchfields experience moderate Reft presence—worse than the core Heartland but better than some border regions. The Reft here show a peculiar diversity.

| Type | Concentration | Location | Behavior |
|------|---------------|----------|----------|
| **Storm Reft** | Heavy | Castrum Vetus | Organized, drilling, under apparent command |
| **Root Reft** | Moderate | Western March | Territorial, don't leave the forest edge |
| **Shadow Reft** | Moderate | Northern March | Ambushers, attack isolated travelers |
| **Growing Reft** | Light | Southern March | Rare but spreading vegetation-corruption |
| **Mixed** | Light | Central areas | Standard wandering Reft |

The Storm Reft concentration at Castrum Vetus is the most immediate concern. No one understands why this type has gathered there or what they're preparing for.

## Travel

Movement between settlements follows military roads, travels in armed convoys, and occurs only during daylight.

| Route | Condition | Safety | Notes |
|-------|-----------|--------|-------|
| **Via Occidentalis** | Maintained | Moderate | Southern section abandoned; northern section patrolled |
| **Via Montana** | Maintained | Good | Regular patrols; dwarven cooperation on northern end |
| **Via Meridiana Militaris** | Maintained | Good | Dragon-kin presence deters most threats |
| **Secondary Roads** | Variable | Poor | Patrol coverage sporadic |
| **Cross-Country** | — | Very Poor | Not recommended under any circumstances |

Average travel times (assuming no incidents):
- Castrum Novum to Castra Silvae: 4 days
- Castrum Novum to Castra Montium: 5 days
- Castrum Novum to Finis Terrae: 6 days
- Any fortress to Vigilia: 2-3 days

## Trade

Trade flows in three directions, each with its own character:

**Western Trade (Collapsed)**

Before the Passing, significant traffic moved through Castra Silvae: timber, herbs, craft goods from the Kingswood; manufactured goods, grain, metal tools heading in. Now: nothing. The forest accepts nothing and provides nothing.

**Northern Trade (Reduced)**

Dwarven goods still flow through Castra Montium, but at reduced volume. The dwarves want less from the lowlands than they used to; they're consolidating, turning inward.

| Export (Northward) | Import (Southward) |
|--------------------|-------------------|
| Grain, preserved food | Metalwork, especially tools |
| Textiles (wool, linen) | Stonework, precision instruments |
| Wine (highly valued) | Cobalt (for spirit-seeing) |
| Paper, inks | Geothermal technology |

**Southern Trade (Stable but Strange)**

Dragon-kin trade continues through Finis Terrae with surprising normalcy. The Dragon merchants are tight-lipped about conditions in their homeland, but goods keep flowing.

| Export (Southward) | Import (Northward) |
|--------------------|-------------------|
| Grain (Dragon-kin don't farm) | Alchemical compounds |
| Finished textiles | Spices, medicinal preparations |
| Iron (they prefer bronze) | Lacquerware, artistic goods |
| Horses (they don't breed them) | Silk, precious gems |

## Religion

**Official Position:** The Solarian Church maintains authority. The Armory-Cathedral in Castrum Novum represents proper doctrine.

**Actual Practice:**

The frontier has never been properly Churched. Military pragmatism overrode religious purity decades ago.

| Tradition | Status | Concentration |
|-----------|--------|---------------|
| **Solarian Church** | Official | Castrum Novum (strong), other sites (minimal) |
| **Theosyn (Old Gods)** | Tolerated | Veterans' communities, especially Mars-worship |
| **Alysian (Folk)** | Suppressed but persistent | Rural areas, especially near Kingswood |
| **Axis Faith** | Officially foreign, practically accepted | Northern March, Castra Montium |
| **Draconic** | Foreign | Southern March, Finis Terrae |

The Devil's Door at Castra Silvae represents the frontier's religious reality: official doctrine couldn't erase older practices because those practices actually worked.

Since the Passing, religious diversity has increased. The Church's failure to protect against the catastrophe has legitimized alternatives. Tribune Frondis permits Alysian offerings at Castra Silvae; Prefect Saxum hosts Axis Faith ceremonies at Castra Montium; Praefectus Calor participates in Draconic rituals at Finis Terrae. Only Castrum Novum maintains Church primacy—and even there, the Shrine of Mercury operates openly.

## The Scars

The Passing left physical and metaphysical wounds across the Marchfields.

**The Burnt Offering:** The primary scar—a half-mile circle of fused glass where nothing lives.

**The Silent Quarter:** A section of Castrum Novum's Canabae where sound doesn't carry properly. Shouts emerge as whispers; whispers echo like screams. Officially blamed on "acoustic architecture." Actually unexplained.

**The Wrong Birds:** Since the Passing, some birds in the Western March fly backward. Not all birds, not consistently, but often enough to notice. They seem healthy otherwise.

**The Memory Holes:** Several locations where people consistently forget why they came. Small areas, easily avoided once identified. The largest is in Vigilia, which is unfortunate for a logistics hub. Decius Velox has posted signs: "REMEMBER YOUR PURPOSE."

# Part Six: Adventure Hooks

## 6.1 The General's Legion

The Reft at Castrum Vetus are drilling. Training. Preparing for something. Their apparent commander—the figure in the ancient general's cloak—hasn't moved from the gatehouse in weeks. But scouts report the Reft formations growing more sophisticated, their movements more coordinated.

**The Hook:** Someone needs to get close enough to understand what's happening. Are the Reft actually being commanded? What turned Storm Reft (normally wild and aggressive) into this mockery of military discipline? And what are they preparing to attack?

**Complications:**
- The approach to Castrum Vetus is open terrain—no cover
- The Reft seem to have sentries
- The old fortress contains tunnels that might provide another approach... but they connect to the Underworld
- Marcian Severus officially forbids reconnaissance (too dangerous); someone would have to go unofficially

## 6.2 The Missing Patrols

Tribune Frondis has lost twelve soldiers to the Kingswood in seven years. Not killed—vanished. They walk toward the treeline and don't return. Tethers are cut; tracks end at the forest edge.

**The Hook:** One of the missing soldiers returned. She walked out of the forest three days ago, confused and silent. She can't or won't speak. She writes fragmentary messages: "They're waiting." "She sent me back." "Find the pages."

**Complications:**
- The returned soldier (Vexilla Tacita, "the silent standard-bearer") may be compromised—something may have sent her back for a purpose
- Tribune Frondis's grandmother's journals are missing pages about the "Waking Protocol"—Tacita's messages suggest these matter
- The Church faction at Castrum Novum wants Tacita burned as "forest-touched heretic"
- Entering the forest is probably suicide; not entering it means never knowing what happened

## 6.3 The Supply War

Lucia Granis is building an independent power base. Her private supply arrangements with Grannaria bypass military control entirely. If she succeeds, she'll control frontier logistics without oversight.

**The Hook:** One of the March Commanders—probably Caia Frondis, who's most politically naive—has approached potential allies about exposing Lucia's private operations. But Lucia controls information flow through Vigilia; she knows about any coordinated action before it happens.

**Complications:**
- Lucia isn't just corrupt—she's genuinely competent; removing her might cause supply collapse
- Marcian Severus won't move without proof, and Lucia has been careful
- Lucia has compromising information on several garrison officers
- The criminal networks operating through Vigilia's Mercury shrine have their own interests; they might help... for a price

## 6.4 The Dragon-kin Silence

Something is wrong in the Dragonlands. Praefectus Calor has pieced together fragments: a schism between the Three Houses, possibly violent. But her Dragon-kin contacts have stopped sharing information entirely.

**The Hook:** A Dragon-kin merchant—an old contact who's traded at Finis Terrae for decades—passed Calor a message before leaving: "The Sleeping Ones dream differently now. Some want to wake them. If they do, nothing in the south survives."

**Complications:**
- No humans have entered Dragon-kin territory in seven years; the borders are closed
- The Temple of the Sleeping Fire's flame has been burning strangely—this may be connected
- The Burnt Offering's inscription ("Here the dreamers touched the sky") may reference the same "Sleeping Ones"
- If the Dragons wake—really wake, not their diminished descendants but the true Sleeping Ones—the resulting power would dwarf anything the Empire can respond to

## 6.5 The Giant's Hand

The Giant's Fingers are uncurling. An inch per year. People are having dreams of ancient rage. The Church insists nothing is happening.

**The Hook:** A dwarven delegation from Kobalthall arrives at Castra Montium with unusual urgency. The Kobalthari have been reading the new inscription appearing on the Covenant Stone. They believe they've translated part of it: "My brother is waking. Warn the small ones."

**Complications:**
- Giants hate dwarves (ancient enmity from the God-Giant War); warning might be a trap
- The Church will respond to any suggestion of giant-activity with inquisitorial attention
- Evacuating the region means abandoning the Northern March—the pass would be undefended
- If a giant actually wakes, nothing human can stop it; the only hope would be intervention from powers that no longer answer prayers
