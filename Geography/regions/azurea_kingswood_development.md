# Azurea: The Kingswood (Coillrí)
## Sub-Region Development Document

---

# Overview

**Region:** The West (Provincia Occidentalis / Gorllewin)
**Sub-Region:** The Kingswood (Regio Silva Regia / Coillrí)
**Capital:** Caerderw (Imperial: Quercum Castrum; Common: Oakhold)
**Character:** Ancient forest, Fae territory, folk traditions, liminal spaces
**City Density:** Very Low — approximately 250 miles between major settlements
**Linguistic Style:** Brythonic/Welsh

The Kingswood is the great ancient forest that was never fully tamed by the Empire. Hundreds of miles of old-growth woodland, home to Forest Elves, Fae courts, and human communities that never truly converted to the Solarian faith. The Church claimed jurisdiction; the forest disagreed. Here, the old ways never died—they simply learned to wear Church vestments when necessary.

Since the Passing, the forest has *closed*. Paths that worked for centuries now lead in circles. The Fae are in crisis, deciding what to do about humanity's failure—and perhaps more troublingly, about their own. The great question that hangs over every glade and grove: *Why didn't the spirits protect us?*

# Part One: The Capital City

## Caerderw — The Forest Capital

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Imperial Name** | Quercum Castrum ("Oak-Fort") |
| **Local Name** | Caerderw ("Fort of the Oak") |
| **Common Name** | Oakhold |

### Location

Caerderw rises from a Fae Age hill-fort in the geographic heart of the Kingswood, where the three great rivers—Coillwynn, Derwyn, and Cenwyn—come closest together before diverging toward the coast. The earthworks predate human arrival by millennia; the Fae raised these ramparts when the world was young, and the hill still remembers its first architects.

The city occupies the crown of a broad, spiraling hill some three hundred feet above the surrounding forest floor. The Coillwynn (Forest-River) curves around the eastern base, while ancient oaks—some older than the Empire itself—grow through and around the walls. The settlement is not so much built *on* the hill as grown *from* it, an organic emergence rather than a conquest.

### Scale

| Period | Population | Notes |
|--------|------------|-------|
| Pre-Passing | ~25,000 | Seasonal fluctuation with festival calendar |
| Post-Passing | ~18,000 | Many fled; some returned when the forest "closed" |

Unlike Imperial cities with their grid patterns and monuments, Caerderw's population disperses into the surrounding woods. The "city" proper holds perhaps half its population at any time; the rest live in scattered homesteads, charcoal-burners' camps, and forest hamlets within a day's walk. They come for markets, festivals, and the Duke's judgments. They leave when the forest calls them home.

### The Quarters (The Five Turns)

Caerderw's streets follow the spiral pattern of the original earthworks, creating five distinct "turns" as one ascends toward the summit. Each turn has its own character, and movement through the city is always either up-and-inward or down-and-outward.

#### 1. The Outer Turn (An Tro Allanol)

**Character:** The widest and lowest ring, where the city meets the forest.

The boundary between Caerderw and the Kingswood is deliberately unclear here. Trees grow between buildings. Gardens blend into wildwood. The Outer Turn hosts:

- **The River Gate** — Main entrance from the Coillwynn, where barges unload
- **The Market of the Leaves** — Open-air market under ancient oaks; traders from across the forest bring goods here
- **Coopers' Row** — Barrel-makers, woodworkers, carpenters; trades requiring fresh timber
- **The Pilgrim's Rest** — Large inn and stables for travelers

The Outer Turn smells of sawdust, woodsmoke, and the green breath of the forest. Animals wander freely—not just dogs and chickens, but deer that seem unafraid, ravens that watch with too-knowing eyes.

#### 2. The Second Turn (An Ail Dro)

**Character:** The craftsman's quarter; skilled trades and their guilds.

Rising above the raw materials of the Outer Turn, the Second Turn houses those who transform them:

- **Weavers' Wynd** — Cloth-makers using forest dyes and wool from the Downs
- **The Smithy Green** — Ironworkers gathered in one area; the Fae avoid this quarter
- **Apothecary Lane** — Herbalists, healers, those who know the forest's medicines
- **The Tanners' End** — Kept downwind; leather-workers using oak-bark tanning

The Second Turn has the busiest streets—too narrow for carts in places, worn smooth by generations of feet. Buildings here are older than those below, timber-framed with plaster that bears centuries of weather.

#### 3. The Middle Turn (Y Tro Canol)

**Character:** Residences for the prosperous; merchants, minor nobility, successful traders.

The Middle Turn marks the transition from commerce to governance. Streets are wider here, buildings more substantial:

- **The Guildhall Row** — Meeting houses for the major guilds
- **The Old Quarter** — Ancient stone buildings, some incorporating standing stones into their foundations
- **The Duke's Approach** — Processional way leading upward
- **The Inn of the Green Man** — Most prestigious establishment; where visiting dignitaries stay

This turn feels the most "normal" to Imperial visitors—until they notice the spiral pattern disorienting them, the way shadows fall strangely, the sensation of being watched by the carved faces on every other lintel.

#### 4. The High Turn (Y Tro Uchel)

**Character:** Aristocratic residences, administrative buildings, the Ducal Palace.

Power resides in the High Turn—or at least, power that humans can see:

- **The Ducal Palace (Llys Caerderw)** — Ancient stone halls incorporating the original Fae earthwork walls
- **The Hall of Justice** — Where the Duke hears cases; justice here follows old forest law
- **The Houses of the Forest Lords** — Residences of noble families with ancient claims
- **The Imperial Residence** — Now empty; the Imperial Governor fled during the Passing and never returned

The High Turn is quieter than those below, its streets patrolled by the Duke's household guard in their green-and-brown livery. Gardens here are carefully tended but deliberately wild-looking—cultivated wilderness.

#### 5. The Crown (Y Goron)

**Character:** The Cathedral and its surroundings; the spiritual summit.

At the peak of the spiral stands the Cathedral of Saint Derwyn, and within it, the secret that defines Caerderw:

- **The Cathedral of Saint Derwyn** — Built *around* rather than *over* the Standing Stone
- **The Standing Stone (Maen Hir)** — Ancient beyond memory, visible through the cathedral's central oculus
- **The Presbytery** — Residences for clergy
- **The Chapter House** — Church administration; increasingly irrelevant
- **The Devil's Door (Drws y Diawl)** — The famous north-facing door; now standing open

The Crown is both the holiest and strangest part of Caerderw. The Standing Stone pre-dates the cathedral by millennia; the Church built around it rather than demolish it, officially claiming it as a monument to pre-Christian saints. Everyone knows the real reason: they couldn't move it. The stone is part of the hill. Perhaps *is* the hill.

### Landmarks

#### The Standing Stone (Maen Hir)

The heart of Caerderw is not the Duke, not the Cathedral, but the Stone. 

Rising thirty feet from the hilltop, it stands in the cathedral's central nave, visible through a circular opening in the roof. The Church long ago gave up trying to explain it; official doctrine holds it as a "monument to the unnamed saints of the forest age." Everyone knows better. The stone is carved—though the carvings shift depending on who looks and when. At dawn, they seem to show trees. At dusk, faces. At midnight, on certain nights of the year, they show something else.

The Stone is warm to the touch, regardless of season. Birds nest in its upper crevices—always ravens, always in threes.

#### The Devil's Door (Drws y Diawl)

Every old church in the Empire has a north-facing door, originally meant for unconverted locals to enter without crossing the sanctified threshold. The Church later ordered them sealed. In Caerderw, the Devil's Door was sealed—for centuries—with iron bands and prayers.

Since the Passing, it stands open.

No one opened it. The iron bands remain, twisted as if by impossible heat. The prayers carved into the stone are still visible, but the door swings free, and through it comes a breeze that smells of deep forest and older things. Some nights, something comes *through* the door. It hasn't harmed anyone—yet—but the clergy no longer sleep in the presbytery.

#### The Ducal Palace (Llys Caerderw)

The Duke of Oakhold rules from a palace that is part fortress, part manor, part something older. The original Fae earthworks form the foundation; human construction rose atop them over centuries. The result is a sprawling complex where corridors don't quite connect logically, where certain doors lead to different places depending on the hour, and where the Duke's private chambers are said to have no fixed location.

The Great Hall can seat five hundred for feasts. Its beams are carved with the history of the Kingswood—including chapters the Church would prefer forgotten.

#### The Market of the Leaves

Caerderw's main marketplace operates under the canopy of seven ancient oaks that grow together at the Outer Turn's widest point. The trees form a natural roof; on rainy days, the market stays dry while the rest of the city soaks. Trading here follows old custom: no iron may be drawn, no lies told, no unfair dealing. Those who violate these rules find the forest... remembers.

The Market operates on the traditional eight-day week of the forest calendar rather than the Imperial seven-day week. Confusion about which days are market days is common among visitors.

#### The Spiral Way

The main street of Caerderw winds from the River Gate to the Crown in one continuous spiral, making seven complete circuits of the hill. Walking the full Spiral Way takes most of a day and is considered a minor pilgrimage. At each turn, shrines mark the transition—officially dedicated to saints, but their carvings tell older stories.

### Atmosphere

**Sound:** Caerderw is quiet by city standards. The forest absorbs noise. What sound carries tends to be natural—birdsong, wind in leaves, the distant rush of the Coillwynn. Craftsmen's hammering seems muffled. Voices don't carry far. Occasionally, from deep in the surrounding woods, something howls—not a wolf, not quite.

**Smell:** Green. Living wood. Woodsmoke. Wet earth after rain. The incense from the Cathedral mixes with the sharp resin of pines. In autumn, the smell of decay is rich and strangely comforting. In spring, the perfume of blossoms is almost overwhelming.

**Sight:** Everything is verdant, overgrown, organic. Buildings wear moss like clothing. Trees grow through walls and roofs. The light is filtered green, even on clear days. At night, the darkness is absolute—the forest drinks starlight—but strange phosphorescence sometimes glows in the deeper alleys.

**Touch:** The air is cool and damp, even in summer. Stone walls are slick with moisture. Wood is everywhere, and it feels *alive* in a way that city-timber doesn't. Visitors report the sensation of being touched by invisible hands—a brush across the cheek, a tug at a sleeve. Locals don't mention it.

### Who Rules

**In Name:** Duke Arthyen ap Cadwgan, seventh of his line, Lord of Oakhold, Warden of the Kingswood, Protector of the Ancient Ways.

**In Practice:** The Duke rules with the forest's permission.

Duke Arthyen is a man of perhaps fifty years, with grey-streaked dark hair and eyes the green of deep shade. He is the product of a family that has ruled Caerderw since the Imperial conquest—and ruled something here before that. His bloodline carries... arrangements. The old compact between the Fae and the first human lords of this place: protection in exchange for respect, power in exchange for service.

The Duke can walk where the forest is closed to others. The Duke's judgments are enforced by things that are not human. The Duke knows names that should not be spoken—and sometimes must speak them.

He is not a tyrant. By all accounts, he governs fairly, protects his people, and maintains what order he can in a disordered age. But he is not entirely *his own*. When the forest demands, he obeys.

**The Current Situation:** Since the Passing, the Duke has grown more withdrawn. He spends long hours in chambers no servant has ever seen. He speaks to counselors no one else can perceive. Rumor holds that the Fae are *demanding* something—some price for the forest's continued protection—and the Duke does not know how to pay it.

### The Tension

**The Forest's Demand**

The Kingswood closed after the Passing—not against the Reft, not against the plague, but against *everyone*. Travelers who once passed freely now walk in circles. Trade routes that connected Caerderw to the coast and the Heartland are severed. The city is protected but imprisoned.

The Fae are angry. The spirits are wounded. And something is being *asked* that the Duke has not yet granted.

Factions within Caerderw interpret this differently:

| Faction | Interpretation | Proposed Solution |
|---------|---------------|-------------------|
| **The Old Faithful** | The forest demands return to the old ways; the Church must be expelled | Remove all Church influence; restore the groves |
| **The Duke's Council** | The Fae seek a specific offering; negotiation is possible | Find what the forest wants; bargain carefully |
| **The Merchants** | The closure is destroying trade; force must be considered | Clear paths by fire if necessary |
| **The Cathedral Chapter** | This is demonic influence; the Stone must be destroyed | Consecrate the hilltop properly; seal the Devil's Door |
| **The Quiet Ones** | Someone must go *into* the deep forest and treat with the Fae directly | Find a willing emissary—or sacrifice |

The Duke navigates between these factions while harboring knowledge none of them share: the forest is not punishing humanity. It is *grieving*. And grief, in the Fae, takes forms that humans find difficult to survive.

# Part Two: Secondary Settlements

## 1. Nant Derwen — The Valley of Oaks

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Imperial Name** | Vallis Quercuum |
| **Type** | Sacred grove-town |
| **Population** | ~1,200 (pre-Passing); ~800 (post-Passing) |

### Character

Nant Derwen sits in a sheltered valley where a tributary of the Coillwynn flows between hills crowned with ancient oaks. This is one of the Kingswood's holiest sites—a place where the Geal-sí (Bright Fae) have been known to manifest openly, where the boundaries between the mortal world and the deeper forest grow thin.

The "town" is less a settlement than a gathering place. Permanent residents are few: the Grove-Keepers who tend the sacred oaks, the healers who gather the valley's herbs, and those who have sworn themselves to the old ways. But on festival nights—the eight points of the Wheel of the Year—thousands gather here. Or they did, before the Passing.

Buildings are few and deliberately impermanent: wattle-and-daub roundhouses, canvas pavilions, wooden platforms in the great oaks themselves. The Grove-Keepers believe that permanent construction insults the spirits. Visitors who build in stone find their structures mysteriously *rearranged* by morning.

### Notable Feature: The Circle of the Witnesses

At the valley's heart stands a ring of nine oaks, each thousands of years old, their branches intertwining to form a natural cathedral. These are the Witnesses—trees that remember when the Eldest Sister's fruit first fell, when the Fae walked openly, when the world was new.

The Church officially condemned the Circle as pagan idolatry. Three Inquisitors came to cut the trees. None returned. The Church did not send more.

Since the Passing, the Witnesses have begun to *speak*. Not in words—in dreams. Pilgrims who sleep beneath their branches receive visions. Some visions are healing. Some are warning. Some are incomprehensible. The Grove-Keepers carefully screen who may approach, and some seekers are turned away for reasons never explained.

### Current Situation

Nant Derwen was at the center of the Passing's impact on the Kingswood. The Geal-sí manifested here during those terrible days—not to protect, but to *mourn*. Witnesses describe seeing the Bright Ones weeping light, their grief manifesting as a luminescence that burned anyone who came too close.

Now the valley is changed. The stream runs colder. The oaks' leaves have turned silver at their edges—a color no oak should bear. The Grove-Keepers say the forest is in shock, and Nant Derwen is where that shock concentrates.

The valley has become a pilgrimage site for those seeking answers: *Why didn't the spirits help?* The Grove-Keepers have no answers. They only tend the trees and wait for the grief to speak its purpose.

## 2. Pont y Coed — The Forest Bridge

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Imperial Name** | Pons Silvanus |
| **Type** | Trading post and river crossing |
| **Population** | ~2,500 (pre-Passing); ~1,400 (post-Passing) |

### Character

Where the Coillwynn widens into a braided system of channels and islands, the ancient Fae built a bridge that should not stand. The Forest Bridge spans nearly half a mile of water and wetland, its supports sunk into islands that seem placed too perfectly for nature, its arches formed of living trees bent and grown into shape over centuries.

Pont y Coed grew around both ends of this crossing—a market town serving traffic between Caerderw and the coastal settlements. Before the Passing, it was the Kingswood's busiest commercial center, where forest products (timber, charcoal, herbs, furs, honey) were traded for coastal goods (salt, fish, metalwork, imports from overseas).

The town is divided between the North Bank (larger, more Imperial in character, stone buildings) and the South Bank (smaller, more traditional, wooden roundhouses). The bridge itself is considered neutral ground—no lord's authority extends upon it, and disputes settled there are binding under ancient custom.

### Notable Feature: The Toll of Leaves

The Forest Bridge cannot be crossed freely. Those who walk it must pay the *Toll of Leaves*—not coin, but an offering appropriate to the season. Spring demands flowers. Summer demands fruit. Autumn demands fallen leaves (gathered, not plucked). Winter demands a drop of blood.

Those who refuse the toll find the bridge *longer* than it should be. They walk and walk and the far end never arrives. Some have walked for days, their supplies exhausted, before finally offering what the bridge requires.

The toll is collected by the Toll-Keepers, a hereditary role going back to the bridge's construction. They are not quite human anymore—generations of service have changed them. They can see who has paid and who has not. They can see other things too.

### Current Situation

The forest's closing has devastated Pont y Coed. Traffic that once flowed freely now barely trickles. Traders who set out from Caerderw often arrive at the bridge days later than expected, confused about the route they took. Traders from the coast fare better—the paths *toward* the forest still work—but their goods pile up with no way to move them inland.

The town is economically dying. The North Bank has emptied as merchants relocate to Coedporth, hoping to survive on coastal trade. The South Bank persists, its residents too stubborn or too rooted to leave. The Toll-Keepers maintain the bridge as they always have, accepting offerings from the few who cross.

Some say the bridge itself is the key. That the ancient compact governing the toll might be renegotiated to open the forest. The current Chief Toll-Keeper, a gaunt woman named Efa Three-Eyes, says nothing at all.

## 3. Ffynnon Ddu — The Black Spring

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Imperial Name** | Fons Niger |
| **Type** | Healing shrine and hospice |
| **Population** | ~600 (pre-Passing); ~900 (post-Passing) |

### Character

In a ravine where the canopy grows so thick that twilight reigns even at noon, a spring emerges from living rock and pools in a basin of black stone. The water is clear, cold, and tastes faintly of iron. Those who drink it find their minds clarified. Those who bathe in it find their bodies healed—not instantly, not miraculously, but faster than they should.

The spring has been sacred since before human memory. The Fae came here first. Then the first human settlers, following the Fae's example. The Church eventually built a small chapel nearby and claimed the spring for Saint Meirion, but the local priests understood: they were not sanctifying a place. They were asking permission to stay.

The town that grew around the spring is a hospice-community. The sick come here seeking healing. Some are healed. Some die peacefully. Some discover that their sickness is not of the body and requires different treatment.

### Notable Feature: The Dark Water's Truth

The Black Spring heals, but it also *reveals*. Those who bathe in its waters find themselves speaking truths they intended to hide. Lies become physically painful. Deception becomes visible—a dark stain on the skin that fades only when truth is spoken.

This makes Ffynnon Ddu a site for oath-taking, treaty-making, and trials. Parties in dispute will drink from the spring and then speak; the spring judges who is truthful. This practice continues even now, perhaps more than ever—in a world where trust has broken down, a place of enforced honesty has value.

The Church's Inquisition once attempted to claim the spring for truth-detection in heresy trials. The spring refused them. Three Inquisitors drank from its waters and immediately confessed, publicly and in great detail, to crimes that saw them executed. No Inquisitor has visited since.

### Current Situation

Ffynnon Ddu's population has *grown* since the Passing—one of the few places in the Kingswood that can claim this. The sick and wounded flood in, seeking the spring's healing. The traumatized come seeking mental peace. Those afflicted by the Reft come hoping the spring might cure the soul-displacement.

It cannot. Several Reft-touched have drunk from the waters and fallen immediately into convulsions as the spring tried to force truth from beings no longer capable of it. The spring seems *distressed* by this—the water has grown colder, the healing slower.

The shrine's caretaker, an ancient priestess named Mother Ceridwen, believes the spring is trying to tell them something about the Reft. She has asked for scholars, mages, anyone who might help interpret what the waters show. Few have answered.

## 4. Coedwig Sanctaidd — The Sanctuary Wood

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Imperial Name** | Silva Sacra |
| **Type** | Monastic retreat and scriptorium |
| **Population** | ~300 (pre-Passing); ~350 (post-Passing) |

### Character

Not all who came to the Kingswood seeking the old ways rejected the Church. Some believed the two could be reconciled—that the faith of the Light might flourish here if it learned to bow to the older wisdom beneath it.

Coedwig Sanctaidd is their experiment. A monastery in the deep forest, its monks follow a strange rule: they observe the Church calendar but acknowledge the Wheel of the Year. They pray to the saints but leave offerings for the spirits. They maintain a scriptorium copying Church texts but also preserve manuscripts the Church has ordered burned.

The monastery buildings are modest stone structures in a forest clearing, deliberately humble. But underground extends the Scriptorum—a vast complex of chambers carved from living rock, where the Order of the Grey Hood preserves the wisdom of both traditions.

### Notable Feature: The Library of Reconciliation

Brother Eudaf, the monastery's founder, believed that truth was singular even when traditions divided. He began collecting texts: Church theology alongside Revnan star-lore, Ostaran death-rites next to Solarian funeral practices, Alysian seasonal wisdom bound with Imperial agricultural manuals.

The Library of Reconciliation now holds perhaps three thousand volumes, many unique. The Church knows it exists—and has, remarkably, not destroyed it. Some say this is because the monastery's location is a secret. Others say the library contains information the Church needs and fears to lose.

The monks spend their lives studying these texts, seeking the common truth beneath the surface differences. Some say they've found it. None will say what it is.

### Current Situation

The monastery has become a refuge. Scholars fleeing the Scouring, priests questioning their faith, Inquisitors who looked too closely at the wrong things—all have found their way here. The community grows, straining resources but enriching discussions.

Abbot Talhaearn, the current leader, welcomes all seekers but worries about what the influx means. Among the refugees, he suspects, are some who have not truly fled—who carry reports back to powers that would see the library destroyed. He has begun hiding certain texts deeper in the caves, preparing for the day the Church's patience ends.

The forest protects the monastery—paths to it twist away from those who mean harm—but even the forest cannot hide everything forever.

# Part Three: Notable Sites

## 1. The Grove of the Forgotten Sister

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Type** | Sacred site, liminal space |
| **Location** | Deep Kingswood, location unfixed |

### History

In the deepest Kingswood, where the canopy is so thick that no light reaches the forest floor, there exists a grove that is not always in the same place. The Fae say it was here before the forest. The oldest human tales say a goddess sleeps beneath it—not Alys (the forest knows Alys), but someone *else*. Someone forgotten.

The grove appears to those who need it, never to those who seek it. Hunters lost in the forest stumble into it and emerge three days later, though they remember only moments. The dying sometimes find it and pass peacefully into Ostara's care. The grieving enter and return with their grief... changed. Not healed, but transmuted into something bearable.

### Current State

Since the Passing, the Grove has been appearing more frequently. A desperate refugee family found it during a Reft attack and emerged unharmed—the Reft had turned in circles around them, unable to enter. A woman mourning her lost children entered and returned with the certainty that they were "home" and waiting.

The Grove-Keepers of Nant Derwen have begun tracking the appearances, trying to find a pattern. They believe the Grove is becoming more *active*—that whoever sleeps beneath it is stirring, perhaps waking. This could be salvation. It could be catastrophe. The old stories are unclear on what happens when forgotten things remember themselves.

### The Hook

A group of pilgrims enters the forest seeking the Grove, carrying something they believe will wake the sleeper. They have not returned. The Duke has forbidden official rescue—the Grove takes whom it takes—but he privately seeks adventurers willing to follow their trail, find the Grove, and determine what has happened. Payment is generous. So is the danger.

---

## 2. The Iron Hollow

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Type** | Cursed site, former mine |
| **Location** | Eastern Kingswood, near the Greenmarches border |

### History

Before the Empire, before the Church, a clan of humans discovered iron ore in the forest. The Fae warned them: iron is anathema to the old powers, and mining it would wound the land. The clan ignored the warning. They dug. They smelted. They prospered.

Then they stopped existing.

The Iron Hollow is what remains. A vast open pit, now overgrown, where no tree grows quite right. The soil is rust-colored. Water that collects in the pit is toxic. Animals that wander in do not wander out. At night, lights are seen in the hollow—not natural light, not Fae-light. Something *else*.

### Current State

The Church made several attempts to consecrate the Iron Hollow, hoping to reclaim it for productive use. Each attempt failed. The last group of priests sent to perform the ritual returned changed—they could no longer tolerate sunlight and soon after walked into the hollow and did not return.

Local people avoid it absolutely. The forest paths curve around it. Even the Reft avoid the place, as if whatever curse dwells there is inimical even to them.

Recently, however, something has emerged from the Hollow. Travelers report a figure walking the forest roads at night—humanoid, cloaked in rust-colored cloth, leaving a trail of dead vegetation. It has spoken to no one, attacked no one. It seems to be *searching* for something.

### The Hook

A village on the Greenmarches border has been found abandoned—every resident gone, their tools left mid-task, but not a drop of blood, no sign of violence. A trail of rust-colored footprints leads toward the Iron Hollow. Someone must investigate what the entity from the Hollow wants, and why it has begun taking people. The Duke offers his protection to anyone willing to follow the trail—but his protection cannot extend into the Hollow itself.

---

## 3. The Spiral of Rotmunð

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Type** | Underworld access point |
| **Location** | Heart of the Kingswood, three days from Caerderw |

### History

Deep in the forest, a grove of trees grows in a perfect spiral—mathematically precise, impossibly natural. At the spiral's center stands an oak larger than any other in the Kingswood, its trunk wide enough for six people to walk inside abreast. And inside is larger than outside.

This is the primary entrance to Rotmunð, the Underworld city of the Rot-Wendan—the Decay-Turners, fungal people who consume spiritual corruption. The stairway inside the oak descends for miles, past layers of root and stone, into chambers of living mycelium where the Rot-Wendan tend the forest's spiritual health.

You do not find the Spiral. It finds you. Those who need what the Rot-Wendan offer—cleansing of corruption, consumption of grief, dissolution of what should not persist—are led here by paths that remember where they need to go.

### Current State

Since the Passing, the Spiral has been *active*. The Rot-Wendan are gorging on corruption, expanding desperately to process the spiritual pollution flooding the world. They have sent emissaries upward—strange, fungal figures appearing in Caerderw's markets—asking for more bodies to join the Whole-Mind. They need help.

Some of those who have joined the Rot-Wendan were Reft-touched. The Decay-Turners report that consuming the corruption that made them Reft is possible—but it changes the consumer. Something in the Reft-corruption is *new*, and the Rot-Wendan are uncertain what they're becoming by eating it.

### The Hook

A beloved healer from Ffynnon Ddu has walked into the forest seeking the Spiral, intending to offer herself to the Rot-Wendan. Her apprentices followed at a distance, hoping to talk her out of it. They found the Spiral—and saw her descend. Then the entrance closed.

Three days later, a fungal figure emerged and delivered a message: the healer is not dead, but she cannot return. She asks for her books, her notes, her life's work, to be brought to her. She is writing something new, learning something vital about the Reft. She needs research materials.

Someone must gather the healer's belongings and bring them to the Spiral—and perhaps descend, and perhaps learn what she has discovered.

## 4. The Court of the Sleeping King

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Type** | Fae court, dormant |
| **Location** | Beneath a hill in the northern Kingswood |

### History

In the oldest tales, before the God-Giant War, a great Fae lord ruled the Kingswood. He was neither Geal-sí nor Dorcha-sí, but something in between—a king of the threshold, the liminal spaces, the doorways between. When war came to the realms, he withdrew. He took his court beneath a hollow hill and slept, waiting for a time when he would be needed again.

The hollow hill exists. The court exists. The Sleeping King exists—or did, when the tales were first told. No one has entered in living memory. The entrance sealed when the king withdrew, and the forest has protected it ever since.

### Current State

Since the Passing, the hollow hill has begun to *hum*. A low vibration, felt more than heard, emanating from the ground. Trees near the hill are putting out leaves in wrong seasons. Animals gather at the hill's base and stare at it for hours before wandering away. 

The Fae say the king is dreaming—and his dreams are bleeding into the waking world. They say he senses that his time may have come. They say the forest's closing is partly his doing—drawing the walls tight, preparing for something.

No one knows how to wake him. No one knows if waking him would be salvation or destruction. The oldest Fae hint that the king's last waking, during the God-Giant War, was not... gentle.

### The Hook

Duke Arthyen has received a message—how it came, he will not say—suggesting that the Sleeping King might be woken through a specific ritual. The message includes partial instructions, enough to be tantalizing, not enough to be useful. He needs someone to find the rest.

The ritual requires components from all the major sites of the Kingswood: water from the Black Spring, a leaf from a Witness-oak, rust from the Iron Hollow, a spore from Rotmunð, and something from the Grove of the Forgotten Sister. Gathering these would be a quest of a lifetime—and might wake something that changes everything.

# Part Four: Key Figures

## 1. Duke Arthyen ap Cadwgan

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Title** | Duke of Oakhold, Lord of the Kingswood, Warden of the Ancient Ways |
| **Role** | Secular ruler of Caerderw and the Kingswood settlements |

### Character

Arthyen appears a man in his middle years, with grey-streaked dark hair worn long in the old fashion, and eyes the deep green of shade beneath oaks. He dresses simply for a duke—wool and leather rather than silk, the only ornament an ancient torc of twisted gold that marks his office. He moves quietly, speaks deliberately, and listens more than he talks.

Those who know him describe a man of genuine compassion burdened by impossible responsibilities. He loves his people—all of them, human and otherwise—and grieves that he cannot protect them better. He maintains justice, keeps peace, and navigates between factions with care. Visitors from the wider Empire often find him unexpectedly reasonable; he has no interest in rebellion or independence, only in preservation.

But there is something *else* in Arthyen. Something that shows in certain lights, at certain moments. His shadow moves wrongly sometimes. Animals react to him strangely—either with immediate trust or immediate fear, never indifference. He knows things he should not know, sees things others cannot see. The forest speaks to him, and sometimes he speaks back.

### Goal

Arthyen wants to save his people—all his people, including the Fae, the forest spirits, the ancient things that most humans have forgotten. He believes the forest's closure is protective, not punitive, and that something is coming that the closure is meant to defend against. He seeks to understand what that something is and prepare for it.

More personally, he seeks to understand his own nature. His family's "arrangements" with the Fae have transformed them over generations; he is not quite human anymore, but he does not know what he is becoming. He fears that the forest's demands may eventually require him to surrender what humanity remains.

### Complication

The forest speaks to Arthyen, but it speaks in riddles. He receives impressions, urgings, fragments of vision—never clarity. He knows the Fae want *something*, but he cannot determine what. Every path he considers seems wrong: opening the forest feels dangerous, keeping it closed feels unsustainable, treating with the Fae directly might require sacrifices he is unwilling to make.

Additionally, his position is weakening. The closure has cut off trade, and his treasury is emptying. The Church faction grows louder in its demands. Merchants speak of forcing paths open. The Duke must act soon, and he does not know what action to take.

## 2. Mother Ceridwen of the Black Spring

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Title** | Keeper of Ffynnon Ddu, Healer of the Waters |
| **Role** | Religious leader and healer |

### Character

Ceridwen is old—old enough that no one remembers when she was young, old enough that the Church's records of Ffynnon Ddu's clergy list her in entries a century apart. She appears as an elderly woman, small and bent, with white hair and eyes that were once blue but have faded to something like morning mist. Her hands shake constantly except when working healing, at which point they become rock-steady.

She speaks rarely and softly, but when she speaks, people listen. Her knowledge of herbal medicine is encyclopedic. Her understanding of spiritual affliction is unmatched. She has healed wounds that should have been fatal, cured diseases that should have been incurable, and eased deaths that should have been agonizing. She has also, reportedly, refused to heal certain patients—and those patients died within days regardless of other treatment.

Those who have drunk from the Black Spring in her presence report that she glows faintly to their truth-enhanced sight—but not with the Light-field glow of sanctity. Something older. Something deeper.

### Goal

Ceridwen wants to understand what the Black Spring is trying to tell her about the Reft. She has watched Reft-touched drink from the waters and convulse as the spring attempts to force truth from beings incapable of it. She believes the spring is perceiving something about the Reft's nature—something vital—but cannot express it in terms humans can understand.

She seeks scholars of the realm-fields, practitioners of traditions beyond the Alysian, anyone who might help her interpret the spring's message. She believes the answer to the Reft might lie in the forest's waters, if only she can learn to read it.

### Complication

Ceridwen is dying. Not of any disease—of age, finally catching up. She has extended her life through the spring's gifts for too long, and the spring is gently, firmly, calling in the debt. She has perhaps a year remaining, maybe less. She needs to find or train a successor who can continue her work, and she needs to understand the spring's message before she goes.

Additionally, not everyone shares her goals. Some believe the spring's reaction to the Reft is a clear message: *these beings are beyond healing, destroy them*. A faction among Ffynnon Ddu's pilgrims has begun advocating for aggressive Reft-hunting rather than Reft-understanding. Ceridwen opposes them, but her authority is waning with her strength.

## 3. Brennin Llwyd (The Grey King)

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Title** | None acknowledged; called the Grey King by those who know of him |
| **Role** | Leader of the Dorcha-sí (Dark Fae) of the Kingswood |

### Character

Brennin Llwyd does not appear often to mortals. When he does, he takes the form of an extraordinarily tall figure wrapped in grey robes, his features never quite visible beneath a deep hood. His voice sounds like wind through winter branches. His presence makes lights dim and shadows deepen. Animals flee his approach; birds fall silent; the forest itself seems to hold its breath.

He is not evil. The Dorcha-sí are not evil—they are simply *other*, aligned with shadow and secrecy and the uncomfortable truths that light reveals. Brennin Llwyd has ruled the dark courts of the Kingswood since before human memory; he remembers when the first human refugees arrived, fleeing the God-Giant War. He remembers the compact that followed.

He speaks in riddles not because he chooses to but because his truth cannot be expressed directly. He sees deeper and darker than mortal minds can process. His warnings are genuine but incomprehensible; his advice is sound but impossible to follow.

### Goal

Brennin Llwyd wants the forest to survive. Not the trees (trees can be regrown) but the *forest*—the spiritual entity, the accumulated awareness of countless lifetimes, the memory that sleeps in root and branch. He fears the Passing has wounded the forest mortally, and the closure is its immune response—drawing in, cutting off, preserving what can be preserved.

He believes the forest needs a *sacrifice*—something given willingly, something of great value, something that will convince the wounded land that it is loved and worth saving. He has tried to communicate this to Duke Arthyen, but his riddles have not been understood.

### Complication

Brennin Llwyd is in conflict with the Geal-sí, who believe the forest should be *opened* rather than fed—that the answer is connection, not isolation. The Bright and Dark courts have not warred openly in centuries, but tension is rising. Brennin Llwyd cannot simply demand his solution; he must convince or outmaneuver the Bright court.

Additionally, his proposed sacrifice is not abstract. He has identified what he believes would most effectively heal the forest: a human child, born during the Passing, willingly offered by their parents. Such a child exists in Caerderw. The parents do not know what Brennin Llwyd wants. The Duke suspects but will not confirm. The situation is spiraling toward a confrontation that none of them want but all of them may be unable to avoid.

# Part Five: Local Conditions

## The Reft Situation

The Kingswood has *fewer* Reft than most Imperial territories—but the Reft it has are stranger.

**Distribution:** Reft are rare in settlements and common in the deep forest. The forest paths that have closed to humans remain open to the Reft, creating the unsettling situation where Reft can travel freely through territory that traps the living. They drift through the trees like leaves blown by wind, following routes that once were roads.

**Predominant Types:**

| Type | Frequency | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------|
| **Root Reft** | Common | Territorial, won't leave their place; often found at crossroads or former shrines |
| **Growing Reft** | Common | Overgrown with plant matter; in the forest, this camouflages them perfectly |
| **Shadow Reft** | Moderate | Hide, ambush; the forest's natural darkness conceals them |
| **Empty Reft** | Rare but increasing | Featureless, forgettable; locals call them "the Faded" |

**The Strange Ones:** Some Reft in the Kingswood don't match any known type. They move with purpose, seem to communicate with each other, and avoid conflict rather than seek it. Locals call them "the Wanderers" and leave them alone. Some speculate they are Reft who were Fae-touched before their transformation—and something of the Fae nature persists in them.

**Hunting and Defense:** Reft-hunting in the Kingswood is complicated by the forest's closure. Hunting parties often get lost, find their prey has vanished, or discover they've been walking in circles while Reft observe from the trees. The most effective defense is staying in settlements and maintaining the old wards—iron at doors (despite the Fae's distaste), salt circles, running water between the living and the dead.

## Travel

Travel within the Kingswood is currently almost impossible for outsiders and merely difficult for locals.

**The Closure:** Since the Passing, the forest has *closed*. Paths that worked for centuries now lead in circles. Landmarks shift position. Travelers who set out for Pont y Coed from Caerderw may arrive at Ffynnon Ddu—or may not arrive anywhere, walking for days before emerging exactly where they started.

**Who Can Travel:**
- **Duke Arthyen** and his immediate household can travel freely; the forest recognizes his bloodline
- **Those with Fae-blood** (including many Forest Elves) can navigate if they concentrate
- **Those the forest *wants* somewhere** arrive without difficulty—but rarely where they intended
- **Grove-Keepers and Shrine-Tenders** have limited passage along their traditional routes
- **Everyone else** needs a guide, and guides are expensive and scarce

**The Old Roads:** The Imperial roads—Via Silvae connecting to Caerderw—are completely blocked. Caravans that attempt them turn around after days of walking nowhere. The forest has reclaimed these routes; trees grow where paving was, and the paths themselves seem to have *moved*.

**River Travel:** The Coillwynn and its tributaries still flow to the coast, and river travel mostly works. This has made Pont y Coed crucial—the bridge is one of the few reliable connections between the forest settlements. Boats can travel downstream without difficulty; upstream is harder, as if the forest resists anything coming *in*.

## Trade

The Kingswood was never a major trading power, but what commerce existed has collapsed.

**What the Forest Produced:**
- Timber (high quality, old growth)
- Charcoal (for smelting throughout the West)
- Herbs and medicines (the Kingswood's healers were famous)
- Furs and game
- Honey and beeswax
- Rare dyes from forest plants

**Current State:** All outgoing trade has ceased. Timber cannot be harvested (the forest won't permit it). Charcoal-burning has stopped. Herbs can be gathered only from areas the forest allows. Hunters report that game has become scarce—not from overhunting but from the animals *hiding*.

The few goods reaching the coast come down the Coillwynn by boat, and even these are dwindling. Coedporth's warehouses are emptying, and the merchants there are desperate.

**What the Forest Needs:**
- Salt (cannot be obtained locally)
- Iron (the Fae hate it, but humans need it)
- Preserved food (fishing is possible, but the coast is far)
- Medicine for conditions the forest herbs can't treat
- News (perhaps most valuable of all)

**Trade Routes:** The only functional trade is by river. Boats from Coedporth can ascend the Coillwynn to Pont y Coed, where goods are transferred and carried (slowly, with difficulty) to Caerderw. This trickle keeps the settlements alive but cannot sustain them long-term.

## Religion

The Kingswood has always been syncretistic; the Passing has accelerated the shift away from the Church.

**The Official Faith:** The Solarian Church maintains the Cathedral in Caerderw and small chapels in major settlements. Since the Passing, attendance has plummeted. The standing stone at the Cathedral's heart mocks the Church's authority; the Devil's Door stands open in defiance of all consecration; the Inquisition cannot operate in a forest that actively opposes it.

**What's Actually Practiced:**

| Tradition | Prevalence | Notes |
|-----------|------------|-------|
| **Alysian (Folk)** | Dominant | The Wheel of the Year governs life; offerings to spirits are universal |
| **Fae Veneration** | Common | Open worship of Geal-sí and Dorcha-sí; shrines in every grove |
| **Ostaran** | Significant | Ancestor veneration; the dead are remembered and honored |
| **Church (Nominal)** | Declining | Some still attend services; most hedge with folk practice |
| **Grey Hood Synthesis** | Growing | The monastery's "reconciliation" approach attracts seekers |

**The Crisis of Faith:** The great question haunting the Kingswood is: *Why didn't the spirits protect us?* The Church's answer (divine punishment for sin) is rejected. The Fae's silence on the matter is troubling. Some have concluded that the spirits tried and failed, that even the old powers could not stop the Passing. This is somehow worse than believing they chose not to act.

**The Standing Stone:** The Stone at Caerderw's heart has become a pilgrimage site for those seeking answers. People leave offerings, pray, sleep in its shadow hoping for visions. The Church officially prohibits this; the prohibition is ignored.

## The Scars

The Passing left wounds on reality itself. The Kingswood has several.

### The Silence of Nant Glaslyn

A valley in the eastern Kingswood where no sound carries. Visitors can shout, ring bells, play instruments—nothing. Sound dies within the valley's bounds. This has made it useless for habitation (the deaf aren't warned of danger) but potentially valuable for those who need to speak without being overheard. The Fae avoid it; they say something *ate* the sound and is still hungry.

### The Twisting at Coed Camwyll

A stretch of forest where directions don't work properly. North becomes south mid-step. Straight paths curve. Travelers who enter rarely emerge where they expect. Before the Passing, this was a minor inconvenience; the Twisting was small and well-marked. Since the Passing, it has grown, and its boundaries are no longer stable. Some days it swallows whole hills.

### The Weeping

Not a place but a phenomenon. Throughout the Kingswood, trees occasionally *weep*—producing a clear, slightly luminescent sap that flows continuously for days before stopping. The sap has medicinal properties (excellent for wound-healing) but collecting it causes the trees to weep faster, as if in pain. The Fae forbid harvesting it; humans do it anyway when desperate.

### The Memory Grove

A small grove where time does not flow normally. Entering, visitors find themselves experiencing moments from the past—not as visions, but as reality. They relive conversations, witness events, sometimes encounter younger versions of themselves. Leaving, they may have been inside for minutes or days; there's no way to predict. The grove has been quarantined; those who enter sometimes don't come back, trapped in loops of their own history.

# Part Six: Adventure Hooks

## 1. The Child of the Passing

**Setup:** Brennin Llwyd, the Grey King of the Dorcha-sí, has identified a child he believes can heal the forest—a girl born during the Passing itself, in the exact moment when the eldritch creatures passed over Caerderw. The child's parents know something is strange about their daughter (she sees things they cannot, speaks to presences they don't perceive) but don't understand what.

**The Problem:** Brennin Llwyd cannot take the child by force—the compact between Fae and humans forbids it. He needs the parents to offer her willingly. He has begun appearing to them in dreams, showing them what the forest's death would mean. They are terrified but wavering.

**The Hook:** The parents approach outsiders—adventurers, scholars, anyone not bound by the local dynamics—seeking help. They need someone to find an alternative, to negotiate with the Grey King, or to discover whether his claim is true. Is their daughter really the key? Is sacrifice really necessary? Can the forest be saved another way?

**Complications:**
- Duke Arthyen knows about this situation but has avoided involvement; his neutrality is becoming impossible to maintain
- The Geal-sí (Bright Fae) oppose Brennin Llwyd's solution and may offer alternatives—but their alternatives have costs too
- The child herself has opinions; she has spoken with Brennin Llwyd directly and has not told her parents what was said

---

## 2. The Toll-Keeper's Bargain

**Setup:** Efa Three-Eyes, the Chief Toll-Keeper of Pont y Coed, has been contacted by something from outside the forest. It offered her a deal: open the forest paths in exchange for... something she won't name. She refused, but the offer stands.

**The Problem:** The forest's closure is destroying Pont y Coed. Efa's loyalty to the old compact—which says the Toll-Keepers serve the forest, not outsiders—is being tested. Some of her subordinates have heard the offer too and think she should have accepted.

**The Hook:** Efa needs someone to investigate who made the offer and what they really want. The entity appeared in dreams, spoke in a voice like grinding stone, and knew things about Efa that no living person should know. Was it the Sleeping King? A surviving giant? Something from beyond the Hawthorne? Efa needs answers before she can respond.

**Complications:**
- Investigating means traveling paths the forest has closed; Efa can provide limited guidance but cannot leave her post
- Some Toll-Keepers are actively considering the offer; trust within the Bridge-Keep is fracturing
- The entity has begun appearing to others, making similar offers; a network of compromised individuals may be forming

---

## 3. The Library's Secret

**Setup:** Abbot Talhaearn of Coedwig Sanctaidd has discovered something in the Library of Reconciliation—a text that shouldn't exist, written in a language none of the monks can read, that appeared on the shelves without anyone placing it there. The text depicts diagrams that seem to show the realm-fields overlapping, and one diagram in particular seems to show a *ninth* field, unlabeled and central to the others.

**The Problem:** The Abbot believes this text may contain information crucial to understanding the Passing and the Reft. He also believes it may be dangerous—that knowledge of this kind could attract attention from those who destroyed entire traditions to suppress it. He needs it translated but trusts no one.

**The Hook:** The Abbot seeks outsiders with knowledge of unusual languages, realm-field theory, or the cosmology of the sisters. He offers access to the Library's resources and sanctuary from the Scouring. In exchange, he wants translation—and he wants it kept secret.

**Complications:**
- The text appears to *change* when closely examined; readers report it saying different things on different readings
- Someone at the monastery is reporting to the Church; texts have gone missing, and the Inquisition may be closer than the Abbot realizes
- The ninth field depicted may be the Abyss—Katiari's realm—and its secrets are not meant for mortal minds

---

## 4. The Spiral Descent

**Setup:** The Rot-Wendan of Rotmunð have sent an urgent message to Caerderw: they have consumed something in the corruption that they cannot process. It is changing them, and they do not know what they are becoming. They request human advisors—people whose perspective differs from the fungal collective, who might help them understand what is happening.

**The Problem:** Descending to Rotmunð requires finding the Spiral, which appears only to those it chooses. Those who enter the Decay-Mouth are transformed by the experience; no one has ever returned entirely unchanged. The Rot-Wendan cannot guarantee safety—they are asking for help, not offering it.

**The Hook:** The Duke has authorized an expedition. Volunteers are needed—people willing to descend into the Underworld, treat with entities that are not quite alive, and potentially sacrifice something of themselves to learn what the Rot-Wendan have discovered about the Reft.

**Complications:**
- The healer who descended months ago has information but cannot communicate it directly; the expedition must find ways to understand her transformed perspective
- Some of the Rot-Wendan have become unstable, their consumed corruption expressing in unpredictable ways
- The knowledge gained may not be usable; what works for fungal collective consciousness may be meaningless to individuals

---

## 5. The King's Dreaming

**Setup:** The Sleeping King beneath the hollow hill is dreaming, and his dreams are bleeding into the waking world. Trees bloom in winter. Shadows move against the light. People near the hill experience intrusive thoughts—memories that aren't theirs, emotions without cause, visions of a war fought before humans existed.

**The Problem:** The dreams are intensifying. If the king wakes, his first act might be beneficial—or catastrophic. The last time he woke, during the God-Giant War, entire forests burned. The Fae are divided: some want him to wake, believing he can restore the old order; others want him to sleep forever, fearing what he might do.

**The Hook:** Duke Arthyen has received a partial ritual for waking the king safely—the components are scattered across the Kingswood's sacred sites. He needs someone to gather them. But the ritual's final step is unclear, and some suspects it may require a sacrifice the Duke is unwilling to name.

**Complications:**
- Each component is guarded by something that must be negotiated with, not fought
- Other factions are seeking the same components for opposite purposes—to ensure the king never wakes
- The king himself may be influencing events, using his dreams to guide the questers toward or away from success
