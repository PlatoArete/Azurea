# Azurea: The Dragonlands (Regio Draconum / Nāgadeśa)
## Sub-Region Development Document

---

# Overview

The Dragonlands represent a unique challenge in the Azurea setting: a region where humans are not masters but guests. Here, the ancient Dragon-kin maintain their autonomous civilization, and human settlements exist in the vast spaces between the ziggurat-cities, serving, trading, and surviving in the shadow of beings who remember the God-Giant War.

**Imperial Name:** Regio Draconum
**Local Name:** Nāgadeśa ("Dragon-Country")
**Region:** South (Provincia Meridiana)
**Climate:** Hot, semi-arid; cooler near mountains and rivers
**Linguistic Influence:** Latin (Imperial administrative), Sanskrit-Dragon-kin hybrid (common speech), ceremonial Dragon-kin languages
**City Density:** Very Low by design—1 major Dragon city per 300+ miles; human settlements scattered in between

# Part One: Understanding the Dragonlands

## The Nature of Human Settlement

The Dragonlands are not colonial territory conquered by the Empire and settled by humans. The relationship is inverted: Dragon-kin permitted human communities to exist within their borders for specific purposes.

**Why Humans Are Here:**

| Purpose | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Labor** | Tasks below Dragon-kin dignity but requiring mortal hands |
| **Trade** | Interface between Dragon-kin economy and the wider Empire |
| **Agriculture** | Intensive farming that Dragon-kin find tedious to manage |
| **Craftsmanship** | Human artisans produce goods Dragon-kin find pleasant but trivial |
| **Observation** | The Dragon-kin find human behavior fascinating in the way naturalists study insects—not cruel, but also not quite respect |

**The Arrangement:**

Human communities pay tribute to local Dragon-kin lords not in gold but in *attention*—information, gossip, news from the wider world. The Dragon-kin, who think in centuries, find human perspectives on current events refreshingly immediate.

In exchange, humans receive:
- Protection from external threats (including, before the Passing, the Church's more aggressive elements)
- Access to Dragon-kin markets and occasional magical assistance
- Stability that most Imperial territories lack
- Exemption from many Imperial laws (the Dragon-kin ignore Imperial authority; so do their humans)

## The Three Houses and Human Communities

Each Dragon-kin House maintains different relationships with human settlements:

**Lóng-Imperiales (Administrators):**
- View humans as useful subordinates
- Human communities near Lóng-Imperiales territory are well-organized, regulated, taxed fairly
- Administrative positions sometimes open to humans (always subordinate to Dragon-kin)
- Most "Imperial" in style—Latin names, systematic governance

**Tiān-Phanes (Philosophers):**
- View humans as interesting specimens for study
- Human communities near Tiān-Phanes territory have unusual freedoms—the philosophers want to see what humans do when left alone
- Occasional human scholars accepted into Tiān-Phanes academies (rare honor, often overwhelming)
- Greek-influenced naming conventions, experimental social structures

**Mush-Nāga (Priests):**
- View humans as spiritual participants in the cosmic order
- Human communities near Mush-Nāga territory are deeply religious (Draconic Hegemony faith)
- Humans may become acolytes in the Temple of Deep Fire (never priests)
- Sanskrit-Sumerian naming, temple-centered life

## Post-Passing Conditions

The Dragonlands were the least affected territory in the known world.

**Why They Survived:**
- Dragon-kin wards (ancient protections around their cities)
- Distance from population centers (fewer humans to become Reft)
- The Deep Fire connection (something about proximity to sleeping Dragons provided protection)
- Sheer luck (the Passing's path happened to skim the Dragonlands' edges)

**Current State:**
- Dragon-kin have *withdrawn* from wider affairs, not from damage but from deliberation
- The Consilium Draconis debates endlessly whether to help the Empire or let it fall
- Human communities are simultaneously more autonomous and more anxious
- Trade routes to the north are disrupted; the Dragonlands are increasingly isolated
- Some human communities are thriving (less Imperial interference); others are struggling (less trade)

# Part Two: The Human Capital

## Servitium (Common: The Servant-City; Dragon-kin: Dāsa-Nagara)

### Location and Geography

Servitium sits at the intersection of three Dragon-kin spheres of influence—roughly equidistant from Lóngyuán, Tiānmén, and Nāgarat. This positioning is deliberate; the city exists precisely because no single House wished to administer the unglamorous business of human coordination.

**Geography:**
- Built on a low plateau overlooking a river valley
- The Vitaflum's southern tributary (the Nāga-Dhara, "Dragon-Stream") flows past the eastern walls
- Surrounded by irrigated farmland in a ring of green against the brown semi-arid landscape
- Three roads radiate toward the three great Dragon cities—the city's entire purpose is to be a waypoint

**Why Here:**

Long ago, the Consilium Draconis required a place where human affairs could be managed without Dragon-kin having to think about them constantly. They designated this site as the "Servant-Place" and encouraged human settlement. Over centuries, it became the de facto human capital of the Dragonlands—though no Dragon-kin would use that term. To them, it remains simply "where the humans coordinate."

### Scale

| Period | Population | Notes |
|--------|------------|-------|
| Pre-Passing | ~45,000 | Largest human settlement in the Dragonlands |
| Post-Passing | ~35,000 | Relatively stable; refugees from north balanced by reduced trade |

By Imperial standards, Servitium is a modest provincial city. By Dragonlands standards, it is enormous—most human settlements here number in the hundreds, not thousands.

### The Five Quarters

**1. The Tripartite Quarter (Forum Triumphis)**

The administrative heart, where representatives of all three Dragon Houses maintain embassies—or rather, observation posts.

- **The Three Pavilions:** Identical structures (a diplomatic compromise) housing Dragon-kin officials who rarely visit but whose authority is absolute
- **The Human Prefect's Palace:** Where actual day-to-day governance happens
- **The Forum of Voices:** Public square where announcements are made and disputes settled
- **The Archive of Tribute:** Records of every payment, service, and obligation between humans and Dragon-kin

*Atmosphere:* Quiet, orderly, slightly oppressive. People speak in low voices here.

**2. The Merchant Quarter (Forum Mercatus)**

Where trade happens—goods flowing between the three Dragon cities, between the Dragonlands and the wider Empire, between humans and Dragon-kin.

- **The Triple Caravansary:** Vast courtyard complex serving traders from all three routes
- **The Scales of Balance:** Marketplace where Dragon-kin occasionally shop (or send servants)
- **The Exchanger's Row:** Currency changers, gem dealers, exotic goods brokers
- **The Warehouse District:** Storage for goods in transit

*Atmosphere:* The only noisy part of the city. Humans here act more like humans elsewhere—haggling, arguing, laughing.

**3. The Craftsman's Quarter (Forum Artifex)**

Where human artisans produce goods for Dragon-kin markets—items the Dragon-kin find pleasant but beneath their attention to make.

- **The Weavers' Street:** Fine textiles in styles Dragon-kin appreciate (humans here have developed unique aesthetic traditions shaped by Dragon-kin preferences)
- **The Potter's Hill:** Ceramics for Dragon-kin households (scaled appropriately—a Dragon-kin teacup is a human bathtub)
- **The Incense Masters:** Producing the specific scents Dragon-kin favor
- **The Pavilion of Comfortable Things:** Guild headquarters where quality standards are maintained

*Atmosphere:* Industrious, proud. These craftsmen know their work pleases beings who've existed since before the Empire.

**4. The Temple Quarter (Forum Sacrum)**

Religious district reflecting the Dragonlands' unique spiritual situation.

- **The Shrine of Deep Fire:** Draconic Hegemony temple (largest structure in the quarter; humans worship here alongside Dragon-kin, in appropriately scaled sections)
- **The Chapel of Distant Light:** Solarian Church presence (tiny, tolerated, mostly used by Imperial traders)
- **The Sun-Basker's Garden:** Tapassan meditation space (open-air, south-facing, always warm)
- **The Ancestor Niche:** Small Ostaran shrine (the Dragon-kin approve of ancestor veneration)
- **The Hidden Ways:** Whispered to exist—shrines to traditions the Dragon-kin don't officially know about

*Atmosphere:* Reverent but not oppressive. Religion here is practical—humans worship what works.

**5. The Living Quarter (Forum Vivendi)**

Where ordinary humans live—workers, farmers (when in city), servants of servants of Dragon-kin.

- **The Dormitory Blocks:** Communal housing in Dragon-kin style (humans have adopted some Dragon-kin architectural preferences)
- **The Bathhouses:** Public facilities maintained to high standards (Dragon-kin expectations have raised human standards)
- **The Gardens:** Small green spaces—precious in this semi-arid region
- **The Night Market:** Where informal economy happens after dark

*Atmosphere:* The most human-feeling part of the city. Here, away from Dragon-kin eyes, people relax.

### Landmarks

**The Tripartite Fountain:**
At the exact center of the city, where the three roads meet. Three streams of water flow from dragon-headed spouts, symbolizing the Three Houses. The water is blessed monthly by priests of all three Houses (in rotation—no one House should bless more often than another).

**The Observation Tower (Prajna-Stambha):**
A tall tower where Dragon-kin observers sometimes station themselves to watch human activity. Currently empty—the Dragon-kin haven't sent an observer in three years. The humans keep it maintained anyway.

**The Scaled Wall:**
The city walls are decorated with dragon-scale patterns—not defensively (what could human walls stop?), but as acknowledgment of whose protection the city truly relies upon.

**The Garden of Patience:**
A contemplative space designed for Dragon-kin visitors but beloved by humans. Benches built for Dragon-kin (humans feel like children sitting in them) surround a reflecting pool. The garden's name reflects Dragon-kin philosophy: patience is the highest virtue.

**The Human Prefecture:**
The administrative center where the Human Prefect governs. Built in Imperial style but with Dragon-kin proportions—high ceilings, wide corridors, scaled as if Dragons might visit (they rarely do, but the architecture maintains readiness).

### Atmosphere

Servitium feels *controlled* in a way few Imperial cities do. Streets are clean. Crime is minimal. Poverty exists but not destitution—the Dragon-kin find beggars aesthetically displeasing and have made arrangements.

But it's not a happy city. It's efficient. Orderly. Slightly anxious. The humans here know they exist at the sufferance of beings who could eliminate them without effort. They've adapted by becoming *extremely good* at not giving offense.

*Sounds:* Surprisingly quiet. People speak softly. Laughing loudly is considered bad form.
*Smells:* Incense (Dragon-kin preference), clean streets, the dry scent of semi-arid climate.
*Textures:* Smooth stone, worn by centuries of careful maintenance. Everything is well-made, nothing is flashy.

### Who Rules

**The Human Prefect: Marcus Aurelius Servius**

The Prefect is nominally appointed by the Empire but practically chosen by the Dragon-kin (who present a list of acceptable candidates and let the Empire "choose" from it).

*Current Holder:* Marcus Aurelius Servius, age 61, has served for thirty years. A career administrator who understood early that success means invisibility—problems solved before Dragon-kin notice them.

*The Awkwardness:* Since the Passing, no one is certain who should confirm the next Prefect. The Empire is fractured. The Dragon-kin are withdrawn. Servius is healthy but aging. The question of succession becomes more pressing each year.

**The Council of Quarters:**
Five representatives (one per quarter) who advise the Prefect. Real power—the Prefect rarely overrides unanimous Council decisions.

**The Dragon-kin Observers:**
Theoretically, each House maintains an Observer in the city. Currently, all three observation posts are vacant (the Dragon-kin have withdrawn to deliberate). This creates unprecedented autonomy and unprecedented anxiety.

### The Tension

The Dragon-kin have stopped watching.

For centuries, humans in Servitium knew exactly where they stood: beneath the Dragon-kin, protected by them, obligated to them. The arrangement was constraining but clear.

Now the Dragon-kin deliberate in their great cities and pay no attention to human affairs. The Observers have been recalled. The Pavilions stand empty.

This should feel liberating. Instead, it feels terrifying.

Without Dragon-kin attention, do the old protections still apply? If raiders came from the north, would Dragon-kin intervene? If plague spread, would they help? If human factions fought, would anyone stop them?

The humans of Servitium are learning something uncomfortable: they don't know how to govern themselves. They've spent centuries becoming *excellent* at serving. Now, with no one to serve, they're paralyzed.

# Part Three: Secondary Settlements

## 1. Caravanica (Common: Waystation; Dragon-kin: Pravāsa-Sthāna)

### Location and Character

On the main road between Servitium and Lóngyuán, roughly halfway. The last human settlement before entering Lóng-Imperiales territory proper.

**Type:** Fortified caravansary and market town

**Population:** Pre-Passing: ~8,000 | Post-Passing: ~5,000

**Character:**
A practical town built for travelers. Double-walled (inner for humans, outer for Dragon-kin scale), with massive gates that can accommodate Dragon-kin visitors. Everything is built twice: human-scale facilities, and adjacent Dragon-kin scale facilities.

The town exists because Dragon-kin traveling between Lóngyuán and Servitium sometimes choose to rest. They could travel the distance without stopping, but they find the human amenities *amusing*—a quaint curiosity. This creates economic opportunity.

**Atmosphere:** Hopeful, commercial, slightly frantic. Every Dragon-kin visit is a chance at fortune—they pay in gems, in information, in connections. Humans compete fiercely to provide the most pleasing hospitality.

### Notable Feature

**The Double Inn (Dvandva-Griha):**
A famous establishment with two parallel buildings—one human-scaled, one Dragon-kin scaled. The same design, the same menus (scaled appropriately), the same services. Dragon-kin find this parallelism delightful. Human travelers can drink in the "shadow" of where a Dragon might sit—there's status in that.

**Post-Passing State:**
Trade has collapsed. Few Dragon-kin travel now (deliberation keeps them in their cities). Caravanica is half-empty, its double-infrastructure a monument to better times. Some humans have left for Servitium; others stay, hoping the Dragon-kin will resume normal activity.

---

## 2. Fornax (Common: Furnace-Town; Dragon-kin: Agni-Stambha)

### Location and Character

At the edge of a volcanic zone that Dragon-kin consider sacred—the surface expression of the Deep Fire. No Dragon city is built here (too spiritually potent for casual occupation), but humans maintain this settlement to harvest what the volcanoes produce.

**Type:** Mining and processing town

**Population:** Pre-Passing: ~6,000 | Post-Passing: ~4,500

**Character:**
Humans here extract volcanic glass, sulfur, rare minerals, and most importantly, **Ignis-Stone**—a volcanic rock that naturally holds heat. The Dragon-kin prize Ignis-Stone for their inner-fire meditation practices.

Life in Fornax is hard. The heat is oppressive. The work is dangerous. But the pay is excellent (by Dragonlands standards), and there's pride in providing something the Dragon-kin actually value.

**Atmosphere:** Tough, working-class, proud. People here know they're doing meaningful work, not just "serving."

### Notable Feature

**The Eternal Vent:**
A natural volcanic vent in the town center that has burned continuously for as long as records exist. The Shrine of Deep Fire maintains a presence here, tending the vent. Some believe this particular vent connects directly to where the True Dragons sleep—that tending it earns spiritual merit with the Sleeping Ones.

**Post-Passing State:**
Demand for Ignis-Stone has decreased (fewer Dragon-kin meditation ceremonies). But the town survives because the sacred site draws pilgrims—Dragon-kin who come to meditate at the Eternal Vent, and humans who've developed their own reverence for the place.

---

## 3. Hortulania (Common: Garden-Town; Dragon-kin: Udyāna-Pura)

### Location and Character

In a river valley that receives unusual rainfall (monsoon patterns from the distant east reach here). The most fertile spot in the Dragonlands, transformed into agricultural production for Dragon-kin markets.

**Type:** Agricultural center

**Population:** Pre-Passing: ~12,000 | Post-Passing: ~10,000

**Character:**
Hortulania produces what Dragon-kin like to eat—and Dragon-kin palates are specific. Over centuries, human farmers here have become experts in exotic crops: particular varieties of citrus, specific medicinal herbs, flowers for Dragon-kin ceremonies, fruits that exist nowhere else because only Dragon-kin demand made cultivation worthwhile.

The town is beautiful in a manicured way—endless orchards, terraced gardens, irrigation channels. The humans here are farmers, but farmers who've developed into artists of horticulture.

**Atmosphere:** Green, fragrant, careful. Everything is cultivated, everything is intentional. Wild growth is aggressively pruned.

### Notable Feature

**The Dragon-Garden (Nāga-Udyāna):**
A vast formal garden maintained for Dragon-kin visitors. The scale is immense—pathways wide enough for Dragon-kin to stroll, benches sized for beings ten times human size. Humans who work here as gardeners develop strong opinions about Dragon-kin aesthetic preferences.

**Post-Passing State:**
Thriving, paradoxically. With trade routes disrupted, Hortulania has become even more important—it provides food the Dragon-kin prefer, and they're eating locally now. The town has gained population as other settlements decline.

---

## 4. Terminus (Common: End-of-Road; Dragon-kin: Anta-Pura)

### Location and Character

At the border between Dragonlands and the Jewel Hills (human-dominated territory). The last settlement before leaving Dragon-kin protection; the first settlement when entering it.

**Type:** Border town and checkpoint

**Population:** Pre-Passing: ~7,000 | Post-Passing: ~3,000

**Character:**
A town of two halves: the Dragon-kin side (orderly, quiet, well-maintained) and the Imperial side (chaotic, loud, familiar). The actual border runs through the town center—you can stand with one foot in each jurisdiction.

Before the Passing, Terminus was a bustling border post. Merchants passed through constantly. Imperial officials processed endless paperwork. Dragon-kin inspectors (the Lóng-Imperiales excel at bureaucracy) verified everything.

**Atmosphere:** Split personality. Dragon-kin side feels like stepping into calm water. Imperial side feels like every other border town—desperate, opportunistic, loud.

### Notable Feature

**The Divided Market:**
A marketplace built directly on the border. Stalls on the Dragon-kin side follow strict regulations (fixed prices, quality standards, no haggling). Stalls on the Imperial side operate by Imperial rules (or lack thereof). Watching the same merchant behave differently depending on which side of the line they're on is locally famous entertainment.

**Post-Passing State:**
Nearly abandoned on the Imperial side. What's the point of a border town when no one crosses? The Dragon-kin side maintains itself through habit, but even they admit the purpose has evaporated. Some residents have drifted to Servitium; others have crossed fully into the Dragonlands, accepting Dragon-kin ways entirely.

# Part Four: Notable Sites

## 1. The Field of Deliberation (Vivāda-Kshetra)

### Description

A vast, flat expanse approximately thirty miles from Servitium. This is where, legend holds, the Consilium Draconis met to decide whether to permit human settlement in the Dragonlands—and where they have met for major decisions ever since.

**What's There:**
Nothing. Deliberately. The field is kept completely empty—no buildings, no markers, no paths. When the Consilium meets here, they bring nothing and leave nothing. The emptiness is the point: decisions should be made without distraction.

**History:**
Every major Dragon-kin decision affecting humans has been made here, including:
- The original permission for human settlement (approximately 2,000 years ago)
- The agreement with the Empire establishing the "tribute of attention"
- The post-Passing decision to withdraw and deliberate (still ongoing)

**Current State:**
Humans are forbidden to enter the Field of Deliberation under any circumstances. The boundaries are unmarked but universally known. No human has violated this prohibition in living memory—not because of enforcement, but because the consequences are unthinkable.

**The Hook:**
Recently, humans have noticed that the Field looks *different*. Not in any way they can articulate—nothing has changed, nothing is there. But something about the quality of light, the feel of the air... The Dragon-kin are deliberating more intensely than usual. Some humans believe a decision is imminent.

---

## 2. The Monument of First Service (Prathama-Seva-Stambha)

### Description

A stone pillar approximately forty feet tall, standing alone in the semi-desert between Servitium and Nāgarat. The oldest human-made structure in the Dragonlands.

**What's There:**
The pillar itself is unremarkable stone—not carved by Dragon-kin craft, clearly human work. At its base, barely legible inscriptions in archaic Imperial Latin record the names of the first human settlers who came to serve the Dragon-kin.

Surrounding the pillar: nothing but scrubland for miles. A small well provides water. A tiny shrine holds offerings.

**History:**
The first humans arrived in the Dragonlands as refugees from Imperial persecution (followers of traditions the Church suppressed). The Dragon-kin, curious, permitted them to stay. These refugees built this pillar to commemorate their gratitude and their new beginning.

Over centuries, the pillar became a pilgrimage site. Humans facing difficult decisions come here to seek guidance from the memory of those first servants who chose this strange life.

**Current State:**
Still visited by pilgrims, though less frequently since the Passing (travel is dangerous). The well still flows. The shrine still holds offerings. Some pilgrims report visions or insights—or claim to.

**The Hook:**
A recent pilgrim returned to Servitium claiming the pillar *spoke to him*. He says the names of the first settlers whispered from the stone, warning of something coming—but he can't remember what they said, only the fear in their voices. The Prefect has quietly discouraged others from making the pilgrimage until this can be investigated.

---

## 3. The Sleeping Plaza (Supta-Vīthī)

### Description

In the eastern reaches of the Dragonlands, closer to Nāgarat than to any human settlement. A vast plaza of fitted stone where, according to Dragon-kin testimony, a True Dragon once slept upon the surface before descending into the deep earth.

**What's There:**
A circular plaza half a mile across, paved with black basalt fitted so perfectly that no joint is visible. The stone is warm to the touch at all hours—the Deep Fire rises here. In the center, a shallow depression the exact size and shape of a curled dragon.

No buildings. No walls. Just the plaza, the depression, and the warm stone.

**History:**
The Dragon-kin say this is where one of the Sleeping Ones rested before the Great Withdrawal—when the Dragons chose to descend into the earth rather than participate in the God-Giant War. The plaza was built (or found?) around the sleeping site. When the Dragon finally descended, they left behind this imprint.

Humans are not forbidden from the Sleeping Plaza, but they're not exactly welcome either. Dragon-kin come here for important meditations; human presence is considered inappropriate unless specifically invited.

**Current State:**
Since the Passing, Dragon-kin have been coming to the Plaza more frequently. They don't explain why. They circle the depression, touch the warm stone, and leave. Some humans believe they're trying to communicate with the Sleeping Ones—seeking guidance for the ongoing deliberation.

**The Hook:**
A human merchant, lost in a sandstorm, accidentally sheltered at the Sleeping Plaza. She reports that she fell asleep in the depression and dreamed of fire—and woke knowing things about the Passing she couldn't have known. She won't say what she learned, but she's sold everything she owns and moved to Fornax to tend the Eternal Vent. She says it's the only way she can be of service now.

---

## 4. The Abandoned Embassy (Parityakta-Dūtāvāsa)

### Description

Approximately midway between the Dragonlands and Khaldera, technically in Delta Lands territory but effectively no-man's-land. A complex of buildings designed for Dragon-kin scale but built in Imperial style.

**What's There:**
A compound large enough to house a Dragon-kin delegation, with adjacent human-scale facilities for staff. The buildings are well-constructed but showing decades of neglect—weathering, vegetation encroachment, structural damage from lack of maintenance.

**History:**
Two centuries ago, the Dragon-kin experimented with direct diplomatic engagement with the Empire. They built this embassy as neutral ground. For fifty years, Dragon-kin ambassadors met with Imperial officials here, attempting to formalize relationships.

It didn't work. Dragon-kin think in centuries; humans in years. Negotiations never concluded because the Dragon-kin wouldn't hurry and the humans kept dying and being replaced. Eventually, both sides abandoned the project—too frustrating for everyone.

**Current State:**
Officially, still Dragon-kin property. Practically, abandoned for over a century. Local humans avoid it (feels wrong) and bandits avoid it (fear of Dragon-kin retaliation). It sits empty, slowly decaying.

**The Hook:**
Rumors persist that the embassy contains records of negotiations, including Dragon-kin perspectives on Imperial history that no human has ever seen. The Dragon-kin presumably don't care about these records (they have perfect memories). But humans would find them invaluable—a non-human view of the past two centuries, including events the Empire prefers to forget.

# Part Five: Key Figures

## 1. Marcus Aurelius Servius — The Human Prefect

**Role:** Highest human authority in the Dragonlands

**Age:** 61

**Appearance:** Tall, thin, permanently weary expression. Moves slowly and deliberately—a habit formed over decades of Dragon-kin observation. Dresses in simple robes rather than Imperial finery (Dragon-kin find ostentation distasteful).

**Background:**
Born in Servitium to a family that has served the Dragon-kin for generations. Rose through administrative ranks by being competent and unambitious (the Dragon-kin notice ambition and discourage it). Became Prefect thirty years ago when his predecessor died and the Dragon-kin indicated he was acceptable.

**Character:**
Servius is intelligent, careful, and profoundly anxious. He has spent his entire life learning to anticipate Dragon-kin preferences and act before they have to notice problems. Now the Dragon-kin have stopped paying attention, and his entire skill set feels useless.

He is also, perhaps for the first time in his life, making his own decisions. The experience is terrifying and exhilarating.

**Goal:**
Keep Servitium functioning until the Dragon-kin finish their deliberation and resume normal oversight. He fears that if humans demonstrate any significant independence, the Dragon-kin might decide they're no longer needed.

**Complication:**
Some of Servitium's younger generation don't want Dragon-kin oversight to return. They see the current moment as an opportunity for genuine autonomy. Servius is caught between his instinct for service and a quiet, suppressed part of himself that wonders if they're right.

---

## 2. Adhira Flame-Keeper — High Priestess of the Eternal Vent

**Role:** Spiritual leader of Fornax and most influential religious figure in the Dragonlands' human communities

**Age:** 45

**Appearance:** Burn scars on her hands and forearms (occupational). Dark skin weathered by heat. Hair prematurely gray (also occupational). Eyes that seem to flicker with reflected fire.

**Background:**
Born in Fornax to vent-tenders. Showed unusual spiritual aptitude as a child. At fifteen, survived an accident that should have killed her—fell into a hot spring and emerged unburned, with visions of the Sleeping Ones.

The Mush-Nāga confirmed her as legitimately touched by the Deep Fire—a rare honor for a human. She has served at the Eternal Vent for thirty years, becoming its High Priestess ten years ago.

**Character:**
Adhira is certain, calm, and slightly unsettling. She claims to communicate with the Sleeping Ones through the Eternal Vent—not in words, but in feelings, images, warmth. She speaks about Dragon matters with a confidence that makes other humans nervous.

She is one of the few humans the Dragon-kin take seriously as a spiritual being, not merely a servant.

**Goal:**
She believes the Sleeping Ones are stirring—not waking (which would be catastrophic), but turning in their sleep, dreaming more vividly. She wants to understand what they're dreaming and whether humans should prepare for something.

**Complication:**
Her visions have become darker since the Passing. She sees fire, but also shadow—something cold intruding into the warmth. She fears the Deep Fire is threatened by whatever contamination the Passing brought. But she can't prove it, and speaking too loudly might cause panic.

---

## 3. Gaius Fabricius — Merchant Prince of Terminus

**Role:** Wealthiest human in the Dragonlands; effective ruler of Terminus

**Age:** 52

**Appearance:** Heavy-set, expensively dressed (by Dragonlands standards—which means tasteful rather than flashy). Perpetual smile that doesn't reach his eyes. Hands never still.

**Background:**
Born in the Jewel Hills to a trading family. Moved to Terminus as a young man to exploit the border trade. Built an enormous fortune acting as middleman between Dragon-kin markets and Imperial merchants.

The Passing destroyed his primary business, but Fabricius has adapted. He now trades in *information*—the one commodity that moves despite everything.

**Character:**
Fabricius is ambitious, ruthless, and dangerously smart. He is everything the Dragon-kin dislike in humans: grasping, impatient, self-interested. Yet he's survived by being useful—he knows things, facilitates things, solves problems that others can't.

He is also, secretly, terrified. His entire business model assumed trade would resume. It hasn't. His fortune is depleting. He needs a new angle.

**Goal:**
Find some way to make himself essential to whoever ends up ruling—Empire, Dragon-kin, or someone else entirely. He's exploring every option, including some that would appall the Prefect.

**Complication:**
Fabricius has made contact with Dragon-kin outside the normal channels—specifically, younger Dragon-kin who chafe at the Consilium's endless deliberation. He's playing a dangerous game, trying to position himself as useful to potential Dragon-kin reformers. If the Consilium learned of this, the consequences would be severe.

# Part Six: Local Conditions

## The Reft Situation

The Dragonlands have the lowest Reft concentration of any settled region in the known world.

**Why:**

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Dragon-kin wards | Ancient protections around Dragon cities extend partially into surrounding territory |
| Low population density | Fewer humans to become Reft in the first place |
| Deep Fire proximity | Something about the sleeping Dragons' presence seems to discourage the field-wrongness that creates Reft |
| Distance from Passing's path | The eldritch creatures barely touched the Dragonlands |

**Types Present:**
When Reft do appear, they're most commonly Burning Reft (Light-field) or Root Reft (Land-field). The Dragonlands' hot, dry environment seems to attract these types.

**Concentrations:**
- Terminus border region (where the wards are weakest)
- Along roads connecting to Imperial territory
- Near the Abandoned Embassy (something about the failed negotiations?)

**Management:**
The Dragon-kin occasionally conduct "sweeps"—a single Lóng-Imperiales officer can clear Reft that would require a human army. They do this when the Reft population becomes "aesthetically displeasing," not when humans ask. Humans have learned to tolerate more Reft than they'd prefer because requesting Dragon-kin intervention is socially costly.

## Travel

**Within the Dragonlands:**
Safer than most Imperial territory. The roads are maintained (Dragon-kin travel them occasionally). Bandits are rare (fear of Dragon-kin retaliation). Reft are scarce.

The main challenges are:
- Distance (everything is far apart)
- Heat (travel during day is exhausting)
- Water (know where the wells are or die)
- Dragon-kin etiquette (behave appropriately or face consequences)

**Leaving the Dragonlands:**
The Terminus border is increasingly dangerous. Imperial territory beyond has deteriorated since the Passing. Merchants who once made regular trips now hesitate.

**Trade Routes:**

| Route | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Servitium → Lóngyuán | Open, maintained, safe |
| Servitium → Nāgarat | Open, maintained, sacred (pilgrims) |
| Servitium → Tiānmén | Open, maintained, less traveled |
| Terminus → Jewel Hills | Degraded, dangerous beyond border |
| Terminus → Delta Lands | Degraded, somewhat safer (river traffic) |

## Trade

**What Flows Out:**
- Dragon-kin crafted goods (rare, expensive, extraordinary)
- Agricultural products (Hortulania specialties)
- Ignis-Stone (Fornax production)
- Information (the Dragon-kin's tribute-of-attention becomes trade goods)

**What Flows In:**
- News (the Dragon-kin's payment for human presence)
- Exotic goods for Dragon-kin markets (things that amuse them)
- New humans (replacing those who die, leave, or convert to Dragon-kin ways entirely)

**Current Disruption:**
Trade has collapsed. The Dragon-kin don't need Imperial goods; they're self-sufficient. They permitted trade as a convenience and curiosity, not a necessity. With deliberation occupying their attention, trade has become uninteresting to them.

Humans in the Dragonlands are discovering that their economy depended entirely on Dragon-kin participation. Without it, they're isolated.

## Religion

**What's Official:**
The Solarian Church maintains a theoretical presence, but Dragon-kin have never permitted serious missionary activity. The Chapel of Distant Light in Servitium exists as diplomatic acknowledgment, not religious authority.

**What's Actually Practiced:**

| Tradition | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| Draconic Hegemony (Deep Fire) | Dominant, especially near Mush-Nāga territory |
| Tapassan Way (Sun-basking) | Common, integrated with daily life |
| Ostaran Tradition (Ancestors) | Accepted, practiced alongside Dragon-kin faith |
| Solarian Church | Tolerated, marginal, mostly foreign traders |
| Folk Traditions | Hidden but present, especially among older families |

**The Unique Syncretism:**
Dragonlands religion has developed into something found nowhere else: a human practice of Dragon-kin faith. The Deep Fire theology was never designed for beings without inner fire, yet humans here have adapted it—finding meaning in *receiving* warmth rather than *generating* it.

The Dragon-kin find this human adaptation somewhere between touching and amusing. They don't discourage it.

## The Scars (Passing-Wounds)

The Dragonlands escaped the worst of the Passing, but they weren't untouched.

**The Cold Spot:**
Near Terminus, an area approximately two miles across where the temperature is noticeably lower than surrounding territory. No explanation. Plants grow poorly here. Animals avoid it. Humans who spend time in the Cold Spot report nightmares about vast shapes moving through darkness.

**The Silent Valley:**
Between Servitium and Nāgarat, a valley where sound doesn't carry normally. You can shout and be heard only twenty feet away. The Dragon-kin investigated and pronounced it "an echo of passage"—unhelpful but suggesting they know more than they're saying.

**The Weeping Stones:**
Near Hortulania, a rock formation that produces liquid. Not water—chemical analysis shows something unknown. The liquid is slightly warm and has a faint bioluminescent quality. Humans collect it for unknown purposes; Dragon-kin have taken samples for study.

# Part Seven: Adventure Hooks

## 1. The Empty Pavilion

The Lóng-Imperiales Pavilion in Servitium should be empty—no Observer has been assigned for three years. Yet recently, lights have been seen in its windows at night. The Prefect's guards refuse to investigate (fear of trespassing on Dragon-kin property). He needs outsiders willing to look.

**What's Actually Happening:**
A young Dragon-kin, impatient with the Consilium's deliberation, has secretly returned to observe. She's looking for evidence to support her faction's position (that humans should be more actively involved in Dragon-kin affairs). She's willing to talk to the right humans—if they can prove they're worth talking to.

**Complications:**
If the Consilium learns a Dragon-kin has broken the withdrawal, consequences could be severe. The young Dragon-kin is taking enormous risks—and she needs human allies more than she'll admit.

---

## 2. The Tribute of Attention

The traditional "payment" from humans to Dragon-kin is information—news, gossip, insight into human affairs. With the Dragon-kin withdrawn, no one has collected tribute for years.

The Prefect has been stockpiling information reports, maintaining the tradition even without recipients. Now, a Dragon-kin messenger has appeared for the first time since the Passing, demanding the backlog. But the messenger won't say which House sent them—and they seem *nervous*, which Dragon-kin never are.

**What's Actually Happening:**
A faction within the Dragon-kin is secretly gathering information to use in the ongoing deliberation. The messenger represents a group trying to understand human perspectives on the Passing before the Consilium makes its decision. They're acting without authorization.

**Complications:**
The information collected includes sensitive material—reports on human dissatisfaction, speculation about Dragon-kin weakness, things that could be interpreted as disloyalty. If this reaches the wrong Dragon-kin, the consequences for human communities could be severe.

---

## 3. The Pilgrim's Warning

A human who made pilgrimage to the Monument of First Service has returned with disturbing news: other pilgrims are camped at the site and refuse to leave. They're not hostile, but they're acting strangely—staying awake at night, whispering to the pillar, refusing to eat.

**What's Actually Happening:**
These pilgrims all independently experienced the same vision: the spirits of the first settlers warning that "something follows the fire." They've gathered at the monument trying to understand what this means—and they're convinced that leaving before they do would doom the Dragonlands.

**Complications:**
They may be genuinely experiencing prophetic visions. Or they may be victims of the same magical contamination that created the Cold Spot. Distinguishing between prophecy and madness is not straightforward, especially in a land where visions occasionally prove true.

---

## 4. The Abandoned Embassy

Gaius Fabricius has hired a team to explore the Abandoned Embassy and retrieve whatever records remain. He claims this is commercial (historical documents are valuable) but clearly has other motives.

**What's Actually Happening:**
Fabricius has learned that Dragon-kin meeting records include observations about Imperial officials—including the names of those who were secretly working against the Empire from within. He believes this information could be extremely valuable to whoever ends up ruling the fractured Imperial territories.

**Complications:**
The Embassy isn't as abandoned as believed. Something has taken up residence—not Reft, not bandits, something else. And Fabricius's "simple recovery mission" may attract attention from Dragon-kin who'd prefer those records stay lost.

---

## 5. The Deep Fire Dims

Adhira Flame-Keeper has sent urgent word to Servitium: the Eternal Vent is cooling. Not dying—that's impossible, it's connected to the Deep Fire itself—but cooling noticeably. Her thermal readings show the first decrease in recorded history.

She needs investigators who can travel to Nāgarat and warn the Mush-Nāga directly. She can't leave the Vent, and the message is too important for normal channels.

**What's Actually Happening:**
Something is affecting the Deep Fire. The Ivy—the primordial un-structure creeping into reality—has found a path into the thermal systems that connect the surface to where Dragons sleep. The Dragon-kin don't yet know; their attention is on deliberation, not maintenance.

**Complications:**
Approaching the Mush-Nāga with bad news about their most sacred phenomenon requires extraordinary diplomacy. They may shoot the messenger (metaphorically, probably). And if the information is correct, the implications are terrifying: even the Dragons' realm may not be safe from what the Passing let in.
