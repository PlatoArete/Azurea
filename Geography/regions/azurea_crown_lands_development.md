# Crown Lands (Regio Coronae): Sub-Region Development

## Overview

**Imperial Name:** Regio Coronae
**Local Name:** The Crown
**Region:** Heartland (Provincia Cordis)
**Capital:** Aurheim (secular) + Vandgwyn (spiritual) — the twin capitals
**City Density:** Very High — 1 major city per 50 miles

The Crown Lands encompass the Altheim Plateau itself, the raised tableland at the heart of the Empire. This is where Imperial power was born, where the Church established its seat, and where, for centuries, all roads led. The Mere of Crowns—a long, narrow lake of unnaturally clear water—divides the plateau between its twin capitals: Aurheim the Crowned and Vandgwyn the White.

Before the Passing, perhaps 800,000 souls lived in the Crown Lands. Now, perhaps 200,000 remain—clustered in fortified settlements, fighting over the corpse of an empire.

# Part One: The Twin Capitals

## 1.1 Aurheim — The Crowned City (Secular Capital)

### Basic Information

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Imperial Name** | Aurheim ("Gold-Home") |
| **Local Name** | The Crowned City, The Crown's Crown |
| **Location** | Upper end of the Altheim Plateau, flanked by the Reginwynn (east) and Dominwynn (west) rivers |
| **Pre-Passing Population** | ~350,000 |
| **Post-Passing Population** | ~80,000 |

### The Geography

Aurheim sits in the "V" where the Reginwynn and Dominwynn rivers come closest before curving away southward toward the Mere of Crowns. The city rises on seven hills—natural formations augmented by centuries of construction—with the Crown (the central citadel) commanding the highest point.

The Imperial Palace sits atop what officials deny is a sleeping giant's skull. The shape is unmistakable from certain angles: the curve of a cranium, the suggestion of orbital sockets beneath the foundations. Since the Passing, the denial has grown more fervent even as the evidence has grown more troubling—cracks appearing in ancient stonework, servants reporting rhythmic sounds from below, the palace dogs refusing to enter certain cellars.

### The Districts

**The Crown (Corona)**

The innermost citadel, built on the highest of the seven hills. Here stands the Imperial Palace—a sprawling complex of throne rooms, council chambers, archives, treasuries, and the private apartments of a dynasty that may no longer exist. Golden domes catch the light. Walls of white marble, now somewhat grey with neglect, rise sixty feet. The Crown is accessed through four heavily fortified gates, each named for a cardinal virtue: the Gate of Justice (north), the Gate of Wisdom (east), the Gate of Courage (south), and the Gate of Temperance (west).

*Post-Passing State:* The Palace is occupied but feels empty. The Regency Council meets in chambers designed for hundreds with barely a dozen present. Whole wings have been sealed—some because they're no longer needed, some because of what was found inside after the Passing. The Gate of Courage remains closed since the night Lord Marshal Verus attempted to seize the throne and was found the next morning, still in the saddle, neither he nor his horse showing any sign of how they died.

**The Ring (Annulus)**

The administrative district surrounding the Crown, protected by the second wall. Government ministries, military headquarters, the Imperial Courts (not to be confused with Lexium's law courts—these handle Imperial matters only), the embassies of the provinces and trading nations, and the great houses of the highest nobility. Wide boulevards designed for military parades. Monumental architecture meant to intimidate petitioners.

*Post-Passing State:* Many ministries operate with skeleton staffs, processing paperwork for an empire that may no longer exist. The military headquarters has become a contested zone—three different generals claim authority, their supporters occupying different wings of the same complex. The embassies have mostly closed, their staffs fled or dead. The noble houses are fortified residences now, each a potential faction headquarters.

**The Spokes (Radii)**

Six districts radiating from the Ring like wheel spokes, each with distinct character:

- **Radius Aureus (Golden Spoke):** Wealthy merchants, banking houses, the gold market. Still functions, though the golden standard of Imperial currency has become theoretical.
- **Radius Ferrum (Iron Spoke):** Armories, smithies, the military supply quarter. Busier now than before the Passing. Those who can forge weapons are well-compensated.
- **Radius Vinum (Wine Spoke):** Taverns, pleasure houses, theaters. Much reduced, but humans seek comfort in catastrophe. The remaining establishments cater to those with coin and those with desperation.
- **Radius Templi (Temple Spoke):** Secondary religious buildings, seminary dependencies, shrines. Contested between Church factions, each claiming different buildings as their legitimate base.
- **Radius Fori (Market Spoke):** General commerce, craft guilds, the great markets. Food prices are ruinous. Security is provided by guild-hired mercenaries.
- **Radius Domorum (House Spoke):** Middle-class residences, lesser nobility, successful professionals. Population density has collapsed as refugees fled or died.

**The Fields (Agri)**

Agricultural land outside the walls, watered by the Reginwynn and Dominwynn. Before the Passing, these were productive farms feeding a portion of the capital's appetite. Now they're dangerous—the Reft wander here, and bandit bands prey on anyone attempting to work the land. Some fields closest to the walls are still cultivated by armed work parties that go out at dawn and return before dusk.

### Landmarks

**The Imperial Palace (Palatium Imperium)**

The heart of secular authority. Throne room with the Sunburst Throne (gold and crystal, designed to catch morning light). The Hall of Provinces with mosaic maps of every Imperial territory. The Tower of Whispers where the spymaster worked. The Garden of Emperors with statues of every ruler—the most recent statue is draped in black cloth that no one dares remove.

**The Colossus of Victory (Colossus Victoriae)**

A 120-foot bronze statue overlooking the Gate of Courage, depicting a crowned warrior raising a sword toward the sun. Built to commemorate the Empire's conquest of the northern territories. Since the Passing, the sword arm has developed a noticeable droop. Engineers blame settling foundations. Others blame other things.

**The Sanctum of Imperial Memory (Sanctum Memoriae)**

The Imperial Archives, containing records from every dynasty. Supposedly complete documentation of every law, treaty, tax record, and official correspondence in Imperial history. In practice, liberally edited by each successive regime. The current archivists are scholars who refused to flee—they consider the records more important than their lives.

**The Hippodrome of Champions (Hippodromus Championum)**

Once the Empire's greatest arena for chariot racing and public spectacles. Seating for 80,000. Now mostly empty—the horses are needed for other purposes, and public gatherings invite disaster. One section has been converted to a refugee camp. Another serves as an impromptu market. The racing factions (Blues, Greens, Reds, Golds) have become something like militia units, their loyalties available to the highest bidder.

**The Hall of a Thousand Lamps (Aula Mille Lampadum)**

The premiere ceremonial space for state occasions, connected to the Palace by a covered walkway. Crystal chandeliers designed to create the impression of a starfield. Used now for Regency Council announcements, though attendance is thin and enthusiasm thinner.

### Atmosphere

Aurheim feels like a magnificent corpse. The architecture remains stunning—golden domes, marble colonnades, bronze statuary—but everything is slightly neglected. Dust accumulates in corners. Fountains that ran for centuries have been allowed to dry up (water pressure requires maintenance no one prioritizes). The streets that once thronged with petitioners, merchants, and spectacle-seekers are quiet, the crowds replaced by nervous groups moving with purpose, avoiding eye contact.

The smell is complicated: incense from temple doors left open, underlying sewage from failing infrastructure, cook-fires from improvised kitchens, and occasionally something worse from districts no one has cleared of bodies. Sound carries strangely—you might hear a shouted argument from three blocks away, or miss footsteps approaching from behind.

What remains is pride. Broken, perhaps delusional, but present. These are citizens of the Crowned City. They've survived the end of the world. They will survive whatever comes next.

### Who Rules

**The Regency Council (Consilium Regentis)**

Officially: The Council governs in the Emperor's name until his return.
Actually: Emperor Constantinus IV disappeared on the third night of the Passing. His body was never found. His heirs (two sons, one daughter) died in the chaos—or so the official story goes. The Council was meant to be temporary. Seven years later, it persists.

The Council includes:
- **Lord Regent Valerius Corbulo:** The senior surviving minister. Old, cautious, fundamentally decent but ineffective. He spends more time preventing others from seizing power than exercising it himself.
- **General Aurelia Corvinus:** Commands the 3rd Imperial Legion (or what remains of it). Probably the most competent person in the room. Frustrated that politics prevents effective action.
- **High Chamberlain Petronius Silanus:** Controls the Palace staff and, more importantly, access to whoever's in the Palace. Survived by making himself useful to everyone and threatening to no one.
- **Grandmaster Cassian Veratrus:** Head of the Imperial Exchequer. Controls what's left of the treasury, which gives him leverage. Secretly convinced the others are incompetent and only he can save the Empire.
- **Pontifex Lucerna Marcellina:** Aurheim's representative of the Church. Nominal loyalist to the Hierarchy in Vandgwyn, actually running an independent operation. Provides what spiritual legitimacy the Council can claim.

**The Reality:**

The Council governs perhaps a twenty-mile radius around Aurheim consistently, and claims authority everywhere. Their writs are acknowledged where convenient and ignored where not. The three generals arguing in the military headquarters each report to "the Council" while following their own agendas. The racing factions answer to whoever pays. The guilds maintain their own law within their quarters.

### The Tension

**The Missing Emperor**

Constantinus IV walked into the Palace cellars on the third night of the Passing and never emerged. Search parties found the cellars extensive—far more extensive than any plans showed. One searcher, the only survivor of a twelve-person party, reported stairs going down "past where stairs should go" before she lost consciousness and woke at the cellar entrance.

Since then: periodic sounds from below. Doors that won't stay locked. Palace dogs that howl at nothing. The official position is that the Emperor died heroically defending his realm against eldritch intrusion. The unofficial speculation ranges from "he's trapped below" to "he became something else" to "the giant woke and took him."

**The Succession Crisis**

If the Emperor is dead, someone should succeed. Crown Prince Lucius died defending refugees at the North Gate—his body was recovered, so that death is certain. Prince Cassian was last seen leading a cavalry sortie against Reft congregating on the eastern approach—neither he nor his unit returned. Princess Valeria was evacuated toward Lexium; the convoy was found empty, blood but no bodies.

Various claimants have emerged:
- Duke Maxentius of the Eastern Spokes claims descent from a legitimized imperial bastard
- The surviving Corvinus family argues that General Aurelia has demonstrated fitness to rule
- Rumors persist of a boy in the refugee camps who looks remarkably like the late Crown Prince

**The Vandgwyn Question**

The Church claims spiritual primacy over the entire Empire. Traditionally, this was balanced by Imperial secular authority. With Imperial authority fractured, the Hierarchy in Vandgwyn has begun asserting temporal powers—claiming that righteous governance requires religious sanction.

The Regency Council resents this. Pontifex Marcellina finds herself torn between her nominal superiors in Vandgwyn and her practical loyalties in Aurheim. War between the capitals is unthinkable—but increasingly thinkable.

---

## 1.2 Vandgwyn — The White City (Spiritual Capital)

### Basic Information

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Imperial Name** | Vandgwyn ("White-Holy") |
| **Local Name** | The White City, The City of Light, The Hallowed Seat |
| **Location** | Lower end of the Altheim Plateau, where the Solwynn and Lunwynn rivers converge |
| **Pre-Passing Population** | ~280,000 |
| **Post-Passing Population** | ~70,000 |

### The Geography

Vandgwyn straddles the confluence of two rivers: the Solwynn flowing from the east (catching morning light, hence "Sun-River") and the Lunwynn from the west (silver in evening light, "Moon-River"). Where they meet stands the Isle of Sending—a natural island now entirely occupied by the Cathedral of First Light and its dependent structures.

The city spreads across both riverbanks and the island, connected by bridges that have become choke points for controlling movement. The famous white stone of Vandgwyn's buildings comes from quarries at the plateau's edge—a creamy limestone that gleams in sunlight and glows faintly under moons. Before the Passing, the city seemed to radiate its own light. Now, the white has faded to grey in many districts, as if the city itself were grieving.

### The Quarters

**The Celestial Quarter (Quartus Caelestis)**

Northeast, between the rivers before their confluence. The spiritual heart of the Solarian Church. Here stands the Cathedral of First Light (second only to the original chapel on the Isle of Sending), the Papal Palace, the Great Seminary, the Holy Archives, and the residences of the highest clergy. Wide plazas designed for processions. Fountains (many now dry) depicting scenes from the faith.

*Post-Passing State:* The Quarter functions, after a fashion. The Hierarchy maintains control through a combination of genuine faith, institutional momentum, and the fact that alternatives are worse. The Seminary still trains priests—fewer than before, but enough. The Archives are jealously guarded; scholars require multiple permissions to enter. The Papal Palace contains a secret everyone pretends not to know: the Luminary is mad, and his pronouncements are forgeries created by the cardinals.

**The Merchant Quarter (Quartus Mercatorium)**

Southeast. Trade from the Solwynn, markets, guildhalls, banking houses. Less prestigious than Aurheim's commerce but older, with deeper roots. The Merchant Quarter feeds the Church's operations—sacred vestments need silk, candles need wax, relics need reliquaries.

*Post-Passing State:* Surviving. Commerce continues because commerce must. The guilds have become more powerful as other institutions weakened—they provide employment, security (guild-guards), and a framework for life that doesn't require believing in things that failed. Religious goods remain profitable; people still want to buy faith, even when faith fails.

**The Commons Quarter (Quartus Communis)**

Southwest. Working people, artisans, older buildings, narrower streets. The Quarter where pilgrims stayed before ascending to the Isle. Hostels, cheap food, prayer-sellers. The architecture is medieval—timber and plaster over stone foundations, buildings leaning toward each other across alley-like streets.

*Post-Passing State:* Crowded with refugees who couldn't afford better. Disease has become a problem; the narrow streets breed contagion. The local Kindlers (priests) are overwhelmed. A few neighborhood councils have formed to manage sanitation and security—practical folk faith emerging where institutional faith struggles.

**The Noble Quarter (Quartus Nobilium)**

Northwest. Aristocratic palaces, the Imperial Embassy (representing Aurheim's interests), gardens along the Lunwynn. Old families who established themselves near the Church for prestige and proximity to power. Elegant townhouses, private chapels, walls high enough to discourage the curious.

*Post-Passing State:* Half-abandoned. Many noble families fled to country estates or died. Those remaining maintain their properties as fortified islands. The Imperial Embassy is officially open but practically useless—its staff report to a Regency Council that can barely control its own capital.

**The Isle of Sending (Insula Mittendi)**

The island at the confluence. Entirely occupied by sacred structures: the First Chapel (supposedly built by Solwyn himself), the Cathedral of First Light (the largest church in the Empire), the Luminary's Sanctum, the College of Cardinals, the Crypts of the Radiant Dead.

*Post-Passing State:* Restricted. Access requires permission—officially for reasons of sanctity, actually because the Hierarchy fears what people would see. The First Chapel is closed entirely; something happened there during the Passing that the cardinals won't discuss. The Crypts are active—too many dead to process quickly—and some bodies are rejecting the Sending rites in disturbing ways.

### Landmarks

**The Cathedral of First Light (Cathedralis Primae Lucis)**

The Empire's largest church. Spires reaching toward heaven, visible for miles. Stained glass windows depicting the Light's triumph over darkness—many now cracked or hastily boarded. The Great Nave seats 15,000 for major services. The High Altar incorporates relics of Solwyn: his staff, his sandals, one of his finger bones.

Since the Passing, the cathedral feels *cold*. Not physically—though some say that too—but spiritually. The Light-field magic that once made the interior glow at all hours has faded. Kindlers must use mundane candles. The faithful whisper that God has withdrawn.

**The Luminary's Sanctum (Sanctum Luminaris)**

The residence and office of the Supreme Pontiff. Connected to the Cathedral by covered bridges. Luxurious, though the current Hierarchy maintains official austerity. The Sanctum includes the Audience Chamber (where the Luminary receives petitioners), the Conclave Chamber (where Cardinals meet), and the private apartments.

Luminary Aldric VII entered the Founder's Tomb beneath the First Chapel on the second day of the Passing. He emerged changed. His hair went white overnight. He speaks in riddles. He sometimes refers to himself in the third person, or in plural, or as someone else entirely. He is never seen by anyone outside his closest attendants. The "pronouncements" that bear his seal are written by the Conclave of Flames and read by proxies.

**The Founder's Tomb (Tumulus Conditoris)**

Beneath the First Chapel, accessible through a hidden stair. Solwyn is said to sleep here—not dead, waiting to return in the Empire's hour of need. The tomb has been opened only three times in recorded history: twice during existential crises, once during a succession dispute.

Aldric VII opened it during the Passing, seeking the Founder's aid. What he found, what happened, what he touched—the Hierarchy will not say. But the tomb is now sealed with multiple wards, and the First Chapel above it has been emptied and locked. The official explanation is "ongoing consecration." The unofficial reality is that something is *wrong* in there.

**The Great Seminary (Seminarium Magnum)**

Training institution for priests. A walled compound containing lecture halls, dormitories, libraries, practice chapels, and the infamous Correction House where difficult seminarians were re-educated. Before the Passing, 3,000 seminarians studied here. Now, perhaps 400—and the curriculum has become both more intense and more desperate.

**The Pilgrims' Bridge (Pons Peregrinorum)**

The main approach from the Commons Quarter to the Isle of Sending. Wide enough for twenty to walk abreast. Lined with statues of saints—most are now recognized to be converted Theosyn, but that knowledge is suppressed. The bridge's central span contains a mechanism for raising it during emergencies; this mechanism has been tested twice since the Passing.

### Atmosphere

Vandgwyn smells of incense even now—the Church burns it constantly, and generations of smoke have permeated the white stone. Beneath the incense: river water, fish from the riverside markets, and the pervasive damp that comes from building at a confluence. The famous white walls are greyer now, stained by years of reduced cleaning, but still catch the light in ways that seem almost holy.

The sound is bells. Vandgwyn has 347 churches, chapels, and shrines (before the Passing; some have been abandoned since). Each has bells. They ring at dawn, noon, sunset, and midnight; for deaths, births, and miracles; to summon the faithful and warn of danger. The overlapping bells create a constant background music that visitors find either comforting or maddening.

The people move differently here than in Aurheim. There's less hurry, more procession. Streets are designed for groups walking in formation—penitent marches, holy day parades, funeral cortèges. Even ordinary citizens fall into something like processional rhythm. It's a city built for ceremony, and ceremony continues even when the thing being celebrated has crumbled.

### Who Rules

**The Hierarchy (Hierarchia Sacra)**

The Solarian Church is officially led by the Luminary (Supreme Pontiff). With Aldric VII incapacitated, actual authority rests with the Conclave of Flames—twelve cardinals who elect the Pontifex and advise on doctrine.

Key figures:
- **Cardinal Augustinus Theron:** The senior cardinal, technically acting-regent for the incapacitated Luminary. Conservative, cautious, terrified of schism. Spends his energy preventing others from making things worse.
- **Cardinal Seraphina Valens:** Leader of the "Reformist" faction. Believes the Passing was a wake-up call, that the Church must change or die. Her proposals are considered radical—acknowledging the Theosyn, reconciling with folk traditions, even dialogue with the Revnan.
- **Cardinal Marcus Draconis:** Leader of the "Orthodox" faction. Believes the Passing was punishment for insufficient piety. His solution: more discipline, more purity, more burning of heretics. Commands significant support among the Inquisition.
- **Grand Adjudicator Vespera Noctis:** Head of the Office of Sacred Purity (the Inquisition). Technically reports to the Conclave; practically operates independently. Her agents are everywhere, and her definition of "heresy" has expanded dramatically since the Passing.

**The Factions:**

The Church has fragmented:
- **The Hierarchy:** Maintaining control through institutional momentum and forge-signing the Luminary's pronouncements
- **The Scouring:** Militant movement burning "heretics" and non-humans, drawing on Cardinal Draconis's theology
- **The Flagellants:** Wandering penitents seeking redemption through pain—accidentally tapping the Blood Field
- **The Monastics:** Withdrawn contemplatives preserving knowledge and authentic faith in remote monasteries
- **The Academics:** Scholars secretly questioning doctrine, some sheltered in Lexium
- **The Parish Clergy:** Heroic local priests trying to actually help their communities despite failing institutional support

### The Tension

**The Mad Luminary**

Everyone in Vandgwyn knows and no one discusses: Aldric VII is not capable of leading. His pronouncements are forgeries. The Church's supreme authority is a fiction maintained because the alternative—admitting the Luminary touched something that broke him, that God's chosen representative is mad—would destroy what remains of institutional legitimacy.

But people whisper. Some say Aldric speaks prophecy, if you know how to listen. Some say he touched the raw Light-field itself and was "opened." Some say he touched something else—something that wasn't Light at all, something that was waiting in the Founder's Tomb. Some say he IS Solwyn now, returned as promised, but in a form no one expected.

**The Schism Question**

The Church is visibly fracturing. The Scouring acts without authorization. The Flagellants follow no doctrine the Hierarchy recognizes. Local priests improvise ceremonies because official rites don't seem to work anymore. Cardinal Seraphina openly advocates changes that would have been heresy a decade ago.

Thus far, the Conclave has maintained nominal unity through deliberate ambiguity—neither endorsing nor condemning most factions. But this cannot last. Eventually, someone will demand a definitive pronouncement on doctrine. And when that happens, the Church may formally split.

**The Aurheim Question**

The secular capital has always existed in tension with the spiritual. Now that tension is becoming active conflict. Aurheim's Regency Council refuses to acknowledge Vandgwyn's authority over temporal matters. Vandgwyn's Hierarchy is increasingly asserting that righteous governance requires religious sanction—and that the Council, having failed to prevent disaster, has no legitimacy.

Pontifex Marcellina, the Church's representative in Aurheim, is supposed to bridge this gap. Instead, she's become a pressure point—both sides demanding her loyalty, her position increasingly untenable.

# Part Two: Secondary Settlements

## 2.1 Castellum Pontem — Bridge-Fort

### Basic Information

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Imperial Name** | Castellum Pontem |
| **Local Name** | The Bridge, Bridgetown, The Crossing |
| **Type** | Fortress-town controlling strategic crossing |
| **Pre-Passing Population** | ~25,000 |
| **Post-Passing Population** | ~15,000 |

### Character

Castellum Pontem exists because of geography. The Mere of Crowns stretches nearly forty miles between the twin capitals, too wide for bridges in most places, its waters too deep and strange for easy fords. At one point—roughly the midpoint—the Mere narrows to perhaps a thousand feet. Here, Imperial engineers built the Great Bridge: a quarter-mile span, wide enough for four wagons, the architectural marvel of its age.

A town grew around the bridge. Then a fortress to protect the town. Then a town to service the fortress. Now Castellum Pontem is a strange hybrid: military installation, trading post, choke point, and tax station. Whoever controls the Bridge controls movement between Aurheim and Vandgwyn.

### Layout

The town occupies both shores, connected by the Great Bridge. The eastern shore (Aurheim-side) holds the main fortress—high walls, towers commanding the bridge approach, barracks for the garrison. The western shore (Vandgwyn-side) holds the commercial district—inns, warehouses, customs houses, the establishments that profit from travelers forced to stop.

The Great Bridge itself is a double-decker construction: the upper level for traffic, the lower level containing shops, stalls, and the mechanism for raising the central span. Living on the bridge is prestigious—merchants compete for stall-rights.

### Notable Feature

**The Tollhouse (Domus Vectigalis)**

A massive structure at the bridge's exact center, straddling the road. All traffic passes through. In Imperial times, tariffs were collected for the Emperor. Now, the tolls go to whoever controls the Tollhouse.

### Current Authority

**Commander Marcella Ironhand**

A former Imperial officer who saw which way the wind was blowing. When both capitals began demanding the garrison's loyalty, she demanded neutrality—and the ability to collect tolls for the garrison's maintenance. The Bridge has effectively seceded from both authorities.

Marcella is pragmatic rather than ambitious. She doesn't want to rule the Empire; she wants to keep her people alive and the Bridge functional. She charges everyone equally, maintains the structure meticulously, and has made it clear that any attempt to seize the Bridge will result in her raising the central span and destroying it.

"If I can't have it, no one can." Both capitals believe her.

### The Tension

The Bridge's independence makes everyone nervous. Aurheim wants it to block Vandgwyn's military moves. Vandgwyn wants it to block Aurheim's. Both want the toll revenue. Neither is willing to risk the Bridge's destruction—but someone eventually will try something.

---

## 2.2 Altum Prospectum — The High Watch

### Basic Information

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Imperial Name** | Altum Prospectum |
| **Local Name** | The Watch, Highwatch, The Eyes of the Crown |
| **Type** | Fortress-observatory at plateau's edge |
| **Pre-Passing Population** | ~8,000 |
| **Post-Passing Population** | ~4,500 |

### Character

At the Crown Lands' northern edge, where the Altheim Plateau drops away in dramatic cliffs, stands the fortress of Altum Prospectum. Built originally as a military installation monitoring the approaches from the north, it evolved to include an astronomical observatory—the clearest skies in the Crown Lands, where scholars could watch the stars without urban light pollution.

The fortress sprawls along the cliff edge, its towers serving as both defensive positions and observation platforms. The observatory dome, added three centuries ago, contains the Empire's finest telescope (a gift from Tyrlóng, ironically) and extensive star-charts.

### Notable Feature

**The Celestial Library (Bibliotheca Caelestis)**

The observatory's collection of astronomical texts, including many that document the position of stars in ages past. Some scholars believe the stars have *moved* since the Passing—not in predictable patterns, but erratically. The Celestial Library holds the evidence, if anyone knows how to read it.

### Current Authority

The fortress is held by **Commandant Julianus Astris**, an old astronomer-soldier who treats the Passing as a particularly interesting celestial phenomenon worth documenting. His garrison is small but disciplined; his real loyalty is to knowledge rather than any capital.

### The Tension

The Watch has noticed something disturbing in the northern sky: lights that aren't stars, moving in formations that suggest intention. Nobody wants to send expeditions to investigate. The garrison maintains watch, documents what they see, and prays they're misinterpreting the data.

---

## 2.3 Lacus Reginae — Queen's Lake

### Basic Information

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Imperial Name** | Lacus Reginae |
| **Local Name** | Queen's Lake, The Lesser Water, Reginia |
| **Type** | Lakeside resort town turned refugee camp |
| **Pre-Passing Population** | ~12,000 |
| **Post-Passing Population** | ~20,000 |

### Character

At the southwestern corner of the Crown Lands, fed by streams from the plateau's edge, lies a smaller lake—the Queen's Lake, named for an empress who built a summer palace here six centuries ago. The town of Lacus Reginae grew to serve the palace: inns for courtiers, villas for nobles wanting proximity to power, eventually permanent residences and the infrastructure to support them.

Before the Passing, this was a place for the aristocracy to retreat from urban pressures—cooler breezes, cleaner water, views of mountains in the distance. The palace itself was maintained as a royal retreat.

### Notable Feature

**The Summer Palace (Palatium Aestivum)**

Now a massive refugee camp. When the Passing began, aristocrats fled here seeking safety. Then their servants. Then anyone who could make the journey. The palace grounds—designed for royal leisure—are packed with improvised shelters, cook-fires, and desperate people.

### Current Authority

**Lady Regent Octavia Serena**, a minor royal cousin, claims authority based on blood. Actually, power rests with **the Council of Tents**—elected representatives from each section of the refugee camp. They maintain order, distribute what food arrives, and try to prevent the diseases that mass displacement breeds.

### The Tension

The refugees include people from across the Heartland—different classes, different loyalties, different faiths. The noble families huddling in palace rooms resent the commoners camped in the gardens. The commoners resent the nobles' pretensions. Meanwhile, supplies are running low, winter is coming, and no one has a plan for what happens when they run out.

---

## 2.4 Portus Superiorus — Upper Port

### Basic Information

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Imperial Name** | Portus Superiorus |
| **Local Name** | Upper Port, The Lake Harbor, Coronport |
| **Type** | Port town on Mere of Crowns |
| **Pre-Passing Population** | ~18,000 |
| **Post-Passing Population** | ~10,000 |

### Character

The Mere of Crowns has always been navigable—its waters are eerily calm, its depth consistent, its currents predictable. Before the Via Solis road was fully developed, most traffic between capitals traveled by water. Portus Superiorus grew at the Mere's northern end, providing docks for vessels traveling to and from Aurheim.

The town is essentially a waterfront district that grew beyond its origins: wharves, warehouses, shipyards (for lake vessels), chandlers, taverns for sailors, neighborhoods for dock workers, and the estates of shipping merchants.

### Notable Feature

**The Lake Fleet**

Thirty sailing vessels that comprised the Imperial Lake Transport. Now reduced to perhaps fifteen operational ships, independently operated, competing for cargo. The Lake Fleet represents one of the few reliable ways to move goods between capitals—road travel is dangerous, but the Reft don't swim.

### Current Authority

**The Captains' Moot**—the ship-owners collectively. They elect a Port-Master annually; the current holder is **Captain Tiberius Nautica**, a veteran sailor more interested in keeping the trade routes open than in larger politics.

### The Tension

The Lake Fleet is critical infrastructure in a collapsing world. Both capitals want control. So do various factions seeking to profit from the chaos. Tiberius has maintained neutrality by being genuinely unambitious, but someone younger and hungrier may challenge him at the next Moot.

# Part Three: Notable Sites

## 3.1 The Giants' Stair (Scala Gigantum)

### Basic Information

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Name** | The Giants' Stair |
| **Type** | Geological/artificial formation at plateau edge |
| **Location** | Eastern edge of Altheim Plateau, main approach from Lawlands |

### History

The Altheim Plateau rises sharply from the surrounding lowlands—too sharply for easy approach. The Giants' Stair is a series of massive terraces carved into the cliff face, creating a road that switchbacks up the plateau's eastern edge. Imperial engineers claim credit. Local legend insists the stairs predate the Empire—that they were carved by giants, or *for* giants, or *from* giants.

The truth is unclear. The scale of the stonework is impressive even by Imperial standards. Some blocks show tool marks consistent with human construction. Others show no marks at all, as if shaped by hands large enough to mold stone like clay.

### Current State

The main route from Lexium and the eastern provinces to Aurheim. Heavily traveled before the Passing; now maintained by a garrison at the top that collects tolls (nominally for the Regency Council, actually for themselves). The road remains functional, though several terraces show concerning cracks.

### The Hook

Something has been scratching new marks on the oldest stones. Not graffiti—patterns. Geometric shapes that seem random until viewed from specific angles, whereupon they suggest... something. A message? A warning? A map? Scholars have noticed. So have others.

---

## 3.2 The Drowned Temple (Templum Submersus)

### Basic Information

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Name** | The Drowned Temple |
| **Type** | Submerged ruins in Mere of Crowns |
| **Location** | Deep center of the Mere |

### History

The Mere of Crowns is older than the Empire. Older than human settlement. According to Solarian doctrine, it was always here—a gift from God. According to older legends, the Mere covers something: a city, a prison, a grave.

On calm days, when the unnaturally clear waters are still, observers report seeing structures below: walls, columns, what might be domes. The structures are deep—too deep for diving with current technology—and attempting to reach them has proven... discouraged.

Three expeditions have tried. Two returned immediately, their divers surfacing within minutes, refusing to discuss what they saw. The third never returned.

### Current State

The Hierarchy officially denies the existence of subsurface structures. Unofficially, the Drowned Temple is a theological problem: if something was here before the Church, before the Empire, before humanity—what does that mean for doctrine claiming humanity's special place in creation?

### The Hook

Since the Passing, lights have been observed in the Mere's depths. Not constantly—occasionally, unpredictably. Faint glows that move, pause, and extinguish. The Lake Fleet captains have started navigating around the Mere's center. No one wants to sail directly over whatever is waking up.

## 3.3 The Silenced Field (Campus Silentii)

### Basic Information

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Name** | The Silenced Field |
| **Type** | Passing-wound, reality scar |
| **Location** | Northeast Crown Lands, formerly agricultural region |

### History

Before the Passing, this was unremarkable farmland—grain fields, orchards, a few villages. On the fourth night of the Passing, something happened here that no one witnessed and no one survived.

The villages are empty. The fields are untouched—crops still standing, unharvested, neither rotting nor growing. The silence is absolute: no birds, no insects, no wind. Sound doesn't travel normally; shouts fade within feet of the speaker.

### Current State

A "Scar"—a place where the Passing left permanent damage to reality. The Silenced Field covers roughly eight square miles. No one lives there. No one enters if they can avoid it.

Those who have entered report difficulty thinking—not confusion, but *flatness*. Emotions dampen. Memories become harder to access. One survivor described it as "being slowly erased."

### The Hook

Someone—or something—has begun leaving offerings at the Field's edge. Bread, wine, flowers. Always fresh. No one has witnessed who leaves them. Investigation parties dispatched by the Regency Council have not returned with answers. They have returned... quieter.

## 3.4 The Old Temple of Many Faces (Templum Multorum Vultuum)

### Basic Information

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Name** | The Old Temple of Many Faces |
| **Type** | Pre-Church religious site, now ruined and contested |
| **Location** | Western Crown Lands, hidden in a valley |

### History

Before the Solarian Church achieved dominance, other traditions worshipped other gods. The Theosyn—the "old gods"—had temples throughout the Empire. Most were destroyed, converted, or buried. The Temple of Many Faces survived—too remote to be worth demolishing, too sacred to local folk to be completely abandoned.

The temple honored the Theosyn collectively: Phaelon of the Light, Nikaea of Victory, Therapwyn of Healing, Odyssion of Journeys, and others. Each god had a face-shrine, and worshippers moved between them seeking appropriate blessings. The architecture is pre-Imperial, stone circles and underground chambers, with Solarian additions (a proper roof, mostly) layered over millennia of older work.

### Current State

Abandoned officially, visited secretly. The "Devil's Doors" phenomenon that brought people to seek old gods has manifested here—pilgrims arrive, leave offerings, pray to names the Church taught them to forget.

Since the Passing, the temple has become more active. Lights have been seen. Voices heard—conversations in languages no one recognizes. The face-shrines have been cleaned, the altars restored, though no one admits to doing it.

### The Hook

The Theosyn are waking up. The gods who were converted to saints want their names back. Someone needs to mediate between them and the Church—or prepare for a divine conflict that might make the Passing look gentle.

# Part Four: Key Figures

## 4.1 Lord Regent Valerius Corbulo

### Basic Information

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Name** | Valerius Corbulo |
| **Titles** | Lord Regent of the Empire, Guardian of the Sunburst Throne, Protector of the Realm (all claimed, not all acknowledged) |
| **Role** | Senior surviving minister, nominal head of Regency Council |
| **Age** | 73 |

### Character

Valerius is exactly what you'd expect from someone who survived sixty years in Imperial politics: careful, cautious, non-threatening, and fundamentally decent in ways he learned to hide. He rose through the bureaucracy not through brilliance but through reliability—always competent, never ambitious enough to threaten superiors.

The Passing killed everyone more powerful, more ambitious, more visibly competent. Valerius found himself in charge because no one thought he was worth assassinating. He finds this darkly funny.

He is tired. He sleeps poorly, eats little, drinks too much wine. He knows the Empire is dying and suspects nothing he does will save it. But he cannot abandon his post—that would be unthinkable—so he holds on, day by day, hoping someone more capable emerges.

### Goal

Keep the Empire from complete collapse long enough for something better to emerge. Prevent civil war between Aurheim and Vandgwyn. Find the Emperor or establish a legitimate succession. Retire to his country estate and die peacefully in bed.

### Complication

He's too decent for the job. The Empire needs someone willing to make terrible decisions—execute rivals, seize resources, sacrifice provinces. Valerius can't do that. His decency is simultaneously his greatest virtue and his most dangerous weakness.

---

## 4.2 Grand Adjudicator Vespera Noctis

### Basic Information

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Name** | Vespera Noctis |
| **Titles** | Grand Adjudicator of the Office of Sacred Purity, Guardian of Doctrine, Hammer of Heresy |
| **Role** | Head of the Inquisition |
| **Age** | 58 |

### Character

Vespera was a true believer. She still is—that's the tragedy. She entered the Church as a girl, rose through the Inquisition through genuine faith and genuine talent for investigation, and became Grand Adjudicator because she was effective.

She believed the Church protected the world from darkness. She believed heresy was a disease requiring excision. She believed, with complete sincerity, that burning people was sometimes necessary to save their souls.

The Passing shattered her certainty. The Light did not protect. The Church could not prevent disaster. Everything she believed was called into question. Some people would have changed; Vespera doubled down. If the Passing happened, she reasons, it's because people weren't faithful *enough*. The solution is more purity, more rigor, more burning.

She's become more dangerous than before. Previously, she tempered zeal with institutional restraint. Now, she believes the institution failed and only zeal remains.

### Goal

Purify the Empire. Burn away heresy, apostasy, and doubt. Create a faith so pure that no catastrophe could shake it. Prove that her life's work wasn't meaningless.

### Complication

She's looking into the abyss. The Blood Field—which feeds on suffering—has begun to notice her. Her burnings generate the kind of pain it craves. Without knowing it, she's become a servant of something worse than any heresy she's ever condemned.

---

## 4.3 Captain Tiberius Nautica

### Basic Information

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Name** | Tiberius Nautica |
| **Titles** | Port-Master of Portus Superiorus, Captain of the *Clear Sky* |
| **Role** | Leader of the Lake Fleet |
| **Age** | 52 |

### Character

Tiberius has spent thirty years on the Mere of Crowns. He knows its moods, its currents, its hidden dangers. He's watched storms appear from nowhere, navigated the strange fogs that sometimes blanket the water, and learned to feel when the Mere is *wrong*—when it's better to stay in port and wait.

He has no interest in politics. He captains ships, moves cargo, keeps trade flowing. The Empire's collapse is a problem insofar as it disrupts shipping; otherwise, it's a distant concern. His world is the Mere, the docks, the weather, the reliable rhythms of lake commerce.

This makes him uniquely valuable: he's neutral, competent, and genuinely doesn't want anything from anyone except to be left alone to sail.

### Goal

Keep the Lake Fleet operational. Maintain neutral trade between capitals. Retire eventually to a small house overlooking the water. Avoid getting involved in whatever's happening in the Mere's depths.

### Complication

He's noticed the lights below. He's noticed the water temperature changing. He's noticed that certain routes that were safe for decades now feel *watched*. He doesn't want to know what it means—but he may not have a choice.

# Part Five: Local Conditions

## The Reft Situation

**Severity:** Moderate to High, depending on location

The Crown Lands were densely populated. Dense population meant dense casualties during the Passing. Dense casualties meant many Reft. The twin capitals have established perimeters—walls, patrols, regular clearings—but beyond those perimeters, the Reft wander.

**Predominant Types:**
- **Burning Reft (Light-field):** Most common near Vandgwyn and the Isle of Sending. Drawn to sacred spaces, perhaps resonating with the Light-field energy concentrated there.
- **Bone Reft (Death-field):** Concentrated around Aurheim's failed refugee camps and anywhere large numbers died quickly.
- **Shadow Reft (Dark-field):** Found in the Silenced Field and other Scars, emerging at night.

**Concentrations:**
- The Fields outside Aurheim (former farmland)
- Roads between settlements
- Abandoned villages throughout the region
- The approaches to the Giants' Stair
- The shores of Lacus Reginae

**Management:**
Both capitals maintain Reft-clearing patrols. The garrison at Castellum Pontem clears the bridge approaches daily. Individual settlements rely on militia, walls, and vigilance. Travel between settlements is risky without armed escort.

---

## Travel

**Primary Routes:**

| Route | Type | Condition | Dangers |
|-------|------|-----------|---------|
| Via Solis (Aurheim-Vandgwyn) | Road | Maintained, patrolled | Bandits, tolls at Castellum Pontem |
| The Mere Crossing | Lake | Functioning | Weather, mysterious depths |
| Giants' Stair | Road | Functional, tolled | Reft, tolls, uncertain stability |
| Altum Prospectum Road | Road | Deteriorating | Reft, isolation |
| Western Approaches | Various | Poor | Reft, bandits, Scars |

**Travel Times (by ordinary means):**
- Aurheim to Vandgwyn via road: 2-3 days
- Aurheim to Vandgwyn via Mere: 1 day
- Aurheim to Castellum Pontem: 1 day
- Vandgwyn to Altum Prospectum: 2 days
- Either capital to plateau edge: 1-2 days

**Practical Reality:**
Most people don't travel. Those who must travel in armed groups, move quickly, and stay within walls at night. The Mere route is safest but limited by vessel availability. The Via Solis is theoretically safe but actually dangerous—bandits know that's where the cargo travels.

---

## Trade

**What Flows In:**
- Food (critical—Crown Lands cannot feed their remaining population)
- Raw materials (timber from the west, metals from the north)
- Manufactured goods (from provinces with functioning workshops)
- Mercenaries and militant order members
- Refugees (a constant stream)

**What Flows Out:**
- Government writs (increasingly worthless)
- Church pronouncements (genuinely valued by believers)
- Luxury goods (the wealthy still have things to sell)
- Contracts and legal documents (Lexium remains the legal authority)
- Skilled refugees (fleeing toward perceived safety elsewhere)

**Who Controls It:**
Trade is fragmented. The Regency Council claims authority over commerce in Aurheim; the Hierarchy claims authority in Vandgwyn; Marcella Ironhand controls what crosses at Castellum Pontem; the Lake Fleet captains control what crosses by water. In practice, commerce happens where merchants can negotiate deals and find protection.

---

## Religion

**Official Practice:**
The Solarian Church remains the established faith. Temples are open. Services continue. The Sending (funerary sacrament) remains in demand.

**Actual Practice:**
- Regular Church attendance has increased among those seeking comfort
- Flagellant bands roam, preaching repentance and self-mortification
- Folk traditions have reemerged in rural areas—the old shrines are receiving visitors
- The Devil's Doors (north-facing doors in old churches, originally for converted heathens) have been quietly unsealed in several Vandgwyn churches
- The Theosyn revival is whispered about; some believe the "saints" are remembering their true names

**The Scouring:**
Militant zealots burning "heretics"—defined broadly to include non-humans, folk-practitioners, and anyone who questions Church failure. Active in both capitals, though Vandgwyn Hierarchy officially disowns them while Cardinal Draconis unofficially supports them.

---

## The Scars

**Known Scars in Crown Lands:**

| Name | Location | Type | Effect |
|------|----------|------|--------|
| The Silenced Field | Northeast | Sensory deadening | Sound dies, emotions flatten |
| The Weeping Stones | Near Giants' Stair | Geological anomaly | Stones leak fluid resembling tears |
| The Memory Garden | Western Crown Lands | Cognitive distortion | Visitors forget why they came |
| The Cold Spot | Near Lacus Reginae | Temperature anomaly | Permanent frost despite climate |

These areas are avoided by locals. The Church claims they are being "purified" but shows no evidence of attempting purification. The Regency Council marks them on maps with "CAUTION" but has no resources to investigate.

---

# Part Six: Adventure Hooks

## 6.1 The Luminary's Truth

**Setup:** Rumors circulate that Aldric VII's madness is intermittent—that he has lucid moments in which he speaks prophecy. A faction in the Church wants to record these utterances. Another faction wants them suppressed. A third wants the Luminary "mercifully released" before he says something that destroys the Church entirely.

**The Hook:** The players are approached to gain access to the Luminary's Sanctum—either to listen, to silence, or to rescue. Each faction offers different rewards and different dangers.

**The Complication:** What Aldric knows includes truths about Katiari, the Hawthorne, and humanity's real origins. Any faction learning the full truth would be transformed—or destroyed.

---

## 6.2 The Giant Wakes

**Setup:** The giant beneath Aurheim has begun to stir. Tremors shake the Palace. Servants report voices from beneath. The cellar stairs now go deeper than they should—and something is climbing up.

**The Hook:** The Regency Council needs someone to descend, assess the situation, and either stop what's happening or evacuate before it's too late.

**The Complication:** The giant isn't entirely hostile. It's been sleeping through human occupation, tolerating the city on its skull. It might be willing to continue sleeping—if someone explains what's happening and asks politely. But it's also confused, in pain, and surrounded by centuries of accumulated human construction that feels like parasites.

---

## 6.3 The Drowned Temple Rises

**Setup:** Something in the Mere of Crowns is rising. Not quickly—but the structures that were barely visible in the depths are now closer to the surface. Ships report hulls scraping against submerged domes. The lights below are brighter, more frequent.

**The Hook:** Captain Tiberius wants someone to dive—actually enter the water and investigate what's down there—before it becomes undeniable. The Church wants someone to prove there's nothing (or prove there's something they can suppress). Various factions want whatever power or knowledge the Drowned Temple might contain.

**The Complication:** The Drowned Temple predates not just the Empire but humanity. Its builders were the Fae, or the Theosyn, or something older still. What's waking up may be an ally against the larger threats—or may be exactly as dangerous as those threats.

---

## 6.4 The Bridge War

**Setup:** Someone has decided Marcella Ironhand's neutrality is unacceptable. Assassination attempts have begun. Sabotage of the bridge mechanisms. Rival captains bribed to challenge her authority. The Great Bridge—vital infrastructure—is at risk.

**The Hook:** The players can support Marcella (maintaining neutrality), support one of the capitals (helping them seize the bridge), or work to prevent anyone from controlling it (perhaps by helping Marcella distribute the secret of the bridge's destruction so widely that seizing it becomes pointless).

**The Complication:** If the bridge falls, traffic between capitals collapses. If one capital controls the bridge, the other may consider it an act of war. If the bridge is destroyed, something in the Mere of Crowns may take interest in the increased isolation.

---

## 6.5 The Theosyn Return

**Setup:** The Old Temple of Many Faces is active. Someone—or something—is restoring the shrines. The face of Phaelon has begun to glow. Prayers left at Therapwyn's altar are being answered with actual healing. The gods are waking up, and they want their names back.

**The Hook:** Someone needs to make first contact. The players are recruited—by the Church (to suppress the revival), by the Regency Council (to assess the political implications), by believers in the old ways (to facilitate the return), or by the gods themselves (appearing in dreams, demanding champions).

**The Complication:** The Theosyn remember being converted to saints. Some are willing to forgive. Others want revenge. And the theological implications—that the Church has been wrong for centuries, that the Solarian faith is built on theft—could shatter what remains of social order.
