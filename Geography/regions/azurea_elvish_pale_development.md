# The Elvish Pale (Regio Goleuwyr)
## Sub-Region Development Document

---

# Overview

**Imperial Name:** Regio Goleuwyr
**Local Name:** Tir Golau ("Land of Light")
**Region:** The East (Provincia Orientalis)
**Capital:** Aurhalion
**City Density:** Moderate-High (approximately 80 miles between major settlements)

**Character:** The Elvish Pale is unique in the Empire—a territory where the Goleuwyr (Light-elves) maintained semi-autonomous rule under nominal Imperial sovereignty. Here, the ancient Light traditions survived more openly than anywhere else, creating an ironic situation where the Church's "heresy" was the original truth the Church claimed to worship. Human and elf populations intermingled for centuries, creating hybrid communities with distinctive architecture, festivals, and a complicated relationship with both Imperial authority and Solarian doctrine.

**The Great Irony:** The Solarian Church persecutes elves as "soulless" or "children of darkness." In truth, the Goleuwyr are *children of the Light*—born from Bronwyn's realm, more authentically connected to the principle the Church worships than any human institution. The Church worships Light but persecutes the Light's own people. Many in the Pale know this truth. Few dare speak it openly.

**Post-Passing State:** Thalaurion has closed entirely—quarantine, they say, but also deliberate withdrawal. Aurhalion debates its future: the Hidden faction counsels patience and continued discretion, while the Revealed faction argues the catastrophe proved the Church's impotence, making emergence possible. Meanwhile, human settlements navigate between Imperial collapse, Church fragmentation, and elven neighbors whose true power most humans never suspected.

# Part One: The Capital City

## Aurhalion — The Golden Hall of Light

**Imperial Registry:** Aurhalion Civitas
**Goleuwyr Name:** Aurhalion (ow-HAL-ee-on)
**Common Names:** The Golden Halls, The City of Morning, The Light-Haven

### Location

Aurhalion sits in a natural amphitheater of gentle hills opening toward the eastern sea, positioned to catch the first light of dawn. The city was built where three small rivers converge—the Solfrwd (Sun-Stream), the Lloerfrwd (Moon-Stream), and the Gwawlfrwd (Light-Stream)—creating a delta of canals and reflecting pools before the waters reach the coast three miles distant.

The hills behind the city rise in terraces, each level catching and holding light at different times of day. The highest terrace, called the Godre Goleuni (Hem of Light), receives the last evening rays and the first morning beams, remaining illuminated when the lower city falls into shadow.

**Built On:** Natural limestone formations that glow faintly golden in certain light conditions. The Goleuwyr claim the stone itself remembers their homeland—the Light realm they can no longer reach.

### Scale

| Period | Population | Notes |
|--------|------------|-------|
| Pre-Passing | ~85,000 | Majority Goleuwyr (~60,000), substantial human presence (~25,000) |
| Post-Passing | ~45,000 | Goleuwyr losses relatively low (~50,000 remain); human population halved (~15,000) |

The relative survival rate among Goleuwyr has not gone unnoticed. Some whisper their Light-connection provided protection. Others—crueler voices—suggest the plague "knew" to spare them, proving their inhuman nature.

### The Five Quarters

#### 1. The Aureate Quarter (Rhan Euraidd)

**Location:** Central, around the confluence of the three rivers
**Character:** The ancient heart of Goleuwyr Aurhalion. Towers of pale stone designed to catch and amplify light. Crystalline windows that scatter dawn into rainbow spectrums. Streets laid out in solar geometry—radiating patterns that align with solstices and equinoxes.

**Key Features:**
- **The Mirror Palace (Palas Drych):** Residence of the Light-Lord (Arglwydd Goleuni), traditional ruler of the Goleuwyr in Aurhalion. Walls embedded with polished silver and crystal that create ever-shifting patterns of reflected light.
- **The Temple of the Unconquered Sun (Teml yr Haul Anorchfygol):** The principal Goleuwyr place of worship. No statues—aniconism prevents depicting the infinite Light. Instead, the temple is a masterwork of light-architecture, where sacred geometries guide sunbeams to specific points at specific times.
- **The Library of Dawn (Llyfrgell y Wawr):** Ancient texts the Church doesn't know exist. Histories of the Light realm, theological works predating the Church by millennia, records of the God-Giant War from elven perspective.

**Post-Passing:** Quieter than before. The Light-Lord has retreated from public appearances. The Temple maintains its rituals, but the congregations have shrunk—many elves fear that their survival draws dangerous attention.

---

#### 2. The Imperial Quarter (Rhan Ymerodrol)

**Location:** Southern, built on higher ground overlooking the river-confluence
**Character:** The human administrative district, imposed by Empire during the Incorporation centuries ago. Roman-style architecture clashing with (or attempting to harmonize with) Goleuwyr aesthetics. The compromise is visible in buildings with Imperial proportions but elven ornamental work.

**Key Features:**
- **The Governor's Palace (Praetoria Luminis):** Official seat of Imperial authority in the Pale. A Roman-style complex with audience halls, administrative offices, and a garrison compound. Notably, the building incorporates Light-architecture elements—a concession to local sensibilities that the Church has always viewed with suspicion.
- **The Cathedral of Saint Aldric the Illuminator:** Built to establish Church authority in "heretic" territory. Dedicated to "Saint Aldric"—the Church's sanitized version of Phaelon, the actual Theosyn god of Light who the Church subsumed. The irony of building this cathedral in a city that remembers the *real* Phaelon is not lost on educated elves.
- **The Forum Solis:** Marketplace and public gathering space. Human and elf merchants trade here. Before the Passing, this was one of the Empire's most cosmopolitan markets—silk from Shiranui, gems from Zircon, spices from the Delta, alongside Goleuwyr crystal-work and light-woven textiles.

**Post-Passing:** The Governor's Palace houses a skeleton administration. The Cathedral has lost most of its clergy—fled, dead, or quietly reconverted. The Forum Solis still operates, but trade has dwindled to regional necessities.

---

#### 3. The Twilight Quarter (Rhan Cyfnos)

**Location:** Western, where the setting sun creates long shadows between towers
**Character:** The "between" district where humans and elves lived together most thoroughly. Mixed architecture, hybrid customs, and a population that often defies easy categorization. This quarter produced the Pale's distinctive culture—neither purely elven nor purely Imperial, but something new.

**Key Features:**
- **The Festival Grounds (Maes Gŵyl):** Site of the Festival of First Light, officially a Solarian celebration but actually a survival of far older traditions. During the festival, distinctions between human and elf blur—everyone celebrates the sun's return together.
- **The Academy of Luminous Arts (Academi Celfyddydau Goleuni):** A school teaching Light-magic to both humans and elves. Technically illegal under Church doctrine (humans shouldn't learn from "soulless" teachers), but tolerated due to the Pale's semi-autonomy. Graduates are quietly respected throughout the East.
- **The Threshold Streets (Strydoedd Trothwy):** Narrow lanes where boundary-magic is strong. Doors here sometimes open to places they shouldn't. The Uraeun snake-kin maintain a small, hidden presence here, tending the thresholds.

**Post-Passing:** The most changed quarter. Many human residents fled or died. Some elven families have expanded into vacated homes. The Academy operates with reduced enrollment—those who remain are intensely dedicated.

---

#### 4. The Port Quarter (Rhan Porthladd)

**Location:** Eastern, extending toward the coast
**Character:** The commercial district connecting Aurhalion to broader trade networks. More human than elven in character, though Goleuwyr merchants have always participated. Warehouses, shipyards, and the sort of establishments that appear wherever sailors gather.

**Key Features:**
- **The Golden Wharves (Ceiau Euraidd):** Docks constructed from the same golden limestone as the city's sacred buildings—even commerce happens in Light's embrace here. The approach by sea is famous: the city appears to rise from the water in tiers of glowing stone.
- **The Lighthouse of Morning (Goleudy'r Bore):** A tower incorporating Sunhold technology—crystals that absorb Light-field energy during the day and release it at night. The lighthouse has never gone dark, even during the Passing.
- **The Merchant Consortium Hall:** Where trading houses coordinated. The Consortium included both human and elf merchants, an arrangement that worked better than anyone expected. Now reduced to a handful of determined traders maintaining connections to Portus Aureus and the Eastern Islands.

**Post-Passing:** Trade reduced but continuing. Ships from Portus Aureus arrive regularly. Ships to Thalaurion no longer permitted—the island-city has closed its waters.

---

#### 5. The Hill Quarter (Rhan y Bryn)

**Location:** Northern, climbing the terraced hills
**Character:** Residential district for wealthy elves and ambitious humans. Gardens cascading down terraces. Estates positioned to catch specific qualities of light. The further up the hill, the more exclusively Goleuwyr the population becomes.

**Key Features:**
- **The Godre Goleuni (Hem of Light):** The highest terrace, sacred ground. Here stands the Dawn-Stone, a menhir of unknown age that predates the city. At equinoxes, the first ray of sun strikes this stone before touching anything else in the Pale.
- **The Gardens of Reflection (Gerddi Myfyrdod):** Contemplative spaces with pools, mirrors, and crystalline sculptures designed for meditation on Light's nature. Human philosophers have occasionally been permitted to study here.
- **The Enclave of the Revealed (Cysegr y Datgeledig):** Meeting place for the faction that believes elves should emerge from hiding. Their arguments have grown bolder since the Passing.

**Post-Passing:** The upper terraces have become more exclusive. Some humans who lived here have retreated to the lower city, sensing that the old arrangements are shifting.

### Landmarks

#### The Mirror Palace (Palas Drych)

The residence of the Light-Lord is not merely beautiful—it is *functional*. Every surface is calibrated to channel light in specific ways. Corridors become sundials. Chambers illuminate only at times appropriate for their purpose. The throne room receives direct sunlight only at high noon on the summer solstice, when the Light-Lord traditionally grants audiences to those seeking justice.

The Palace's defenses are equally light-based. Intruders find themselves blinded, disoriented, or simply unable to see doors that should be there. During the Passing, the Palace's light-wards *held*—the eldritch creatures passed through Aurhalion causing devastation, but could not enter the Palace grounds. No one is certain why.

#### The Sunhold Arrays (Heliophora)

Throughout the city, massive crystal arrays absorb Light-field energy during the day and release it at night. The largest—the Aureolis atop the Temple of the Unconquered Sun—creates a permanent golden glow visible for miles. These arrays represent technology the Church has never understood and has alternately coveted and condemned.

Since the Passing, some arrays have cracked or clouded. The light they emit has taken on subtly wrong hues. Engineers from Tyrlóng have offered to help repair them; the Light-Lord has not responded.

#### The Devil's Door of Saint Aldric's

Like many old churches, the Cathedral of Saint Aldric has a north-facing "Devil's Door"—originally built to admit "heathens" who wished to observe without polluting the congregation. In most Imperial cities, these doors were sealed centuries ago.

In Aurhalion, the Devil's Door was never sealed. It remains open. Through it, elves who wish to observe Church services may enter. The arrangement is unofficial, unacknowledged, and has persisted for four hundred years. What happens after dark, when certain humans slip through the Devil's Door to attend services in the Temple of the Unconquered Sun, is even less acknowledged.

---

### Atmosphere

**By Day:** Aurhalion shimmers. Light bounces between towers, fragments through crystals, dances on water. Even overcast days seem brighter here—something in the stone itself seems to glow. The effect is beautiful and slightly disorienting for newcomers. Sounds carry strangely; conversations in the Aureate Quarter can seem to echo from unexpected directions.

**By Night:** The Sunhold arrays activate, and the city becomes a constellation reflected on earth. Streets glow with soft golden light. The upper terraces blaze like a crown of stars. Sailors say you can navigate by Aurhalion's light from twenty miles out.

**The Smell:** Clean stone after rain. The faint ozone of active magic. Flowers from the terraced gardens—jasmine, honeysuckle, species that bloom for light rather than season.

**The Sound:** Bells—not the iron bells of Church towers, but crystalline chimes that ring with the wind, marking time by resonance rather than mechanism. The soft splash of the canals. Conversations in two languages, often shifting mid-sentence between Imperial Latin and Goleuwyr.

---

### Who Rules

**Officially:** The Imperial Governor, appointed by the Emperor to oversee the Pale's administration. The position was always more symbolic than substantive—real power belonged to the Light-Lord, and Imperial authorities maintained a polite fiction of sovereignty.

**The Current Governor:** Lady Serena Valerius Lux, a noblewoman from a family that has held the governorship for three generations. Her grandmother negotiated the current arrangement; her mother maintained it; Serena inherited it just before the Passing. She is fifty years old, practical, and exhausted. She knows the Empire that appointed her no longer exists in meaningful form. She knows her authority extends exactly as far as the Light-Lord permits. She's trying to keep people alive.

**Actually:** The Light-Lord, Caradoc Goleufer (ka-RA-dok goh-LAY-ver), rules the Pale. He is ancient by human standards—over eight hundred years old—and remembers when the Church was young, when "Saint Aldric" was still called Phaelon, when humans first arrived in the Pale seeking refuge from Imperial expansion. He has seen many crises. He is unsure this one will pass like the others.

**The Complication:** The factional divide among Goleuwyr. The Hidden argue for continued discretion—survival requires not drawing attention. The Revealed argue that the Passing proved the Church impotent; now is the time to reclaim their heritage openly. The Bitter, a smaller faction, argue that humans should be expelled entirely. Caradoc must balance these voices while maintaining the fragile arrangement with Lady Serena.

---

### The Tension

The Pale operates on a centuries-old compromise: elves maintain their traditions quietly, humans don't look too closely, the Church pretends its cathedral matters, and everyone benefits from the resulting stability and trade. The Passing has stressed this arrangement to breaking point.

**The Immediate Crisis:** Refugees. Humans from the devastated Heartland have arrived seeking safety. Some are desperate and grateful; others bring Church attitudes and cannot hide their disgust at living among "soulless" creatures. Tensions in the Twilight Quarter have led to violence.

**The Theological Crisis:** Word has spread that elves survived the Passing better than humans. The Church interprets this as proof of their demonic nature ("the plague was divine punishment—of course demons were spared"). More thoughtful observers wonder if perhaps the elves' Light-connection provided genuine protection—which would imply the Church's theology has been wrong about everything.

**The Political Crisis:** The Revealed faction has gained support. Young elves—those who have spent their lives hiding their nature, pretending to be less than they are—want to reclaim their heritage openly. If they push too hard, they may provoke the sort of persecution that the Hidden have successfully avoided for centuries.

# Part Two: Secondary Settlements

## 1. Portus Solis — The Sun-Port

**Imperial Registry:** Portus Solis
**Local Name:** Porthhaul (PORT-hile)
**Common Names:** Sun-Port, The Golden Gate

### Location

Three miles east of Aurhalion, where the combined rivers reach the sea. Portus Solis handles the commercial shipping that would overwhelm Aurhalion's smaller Golden Wharves. A causeway road connects the two cities, lined with warehouses, taverns, and establishments catering to sailors.

### Type

Major trading port and commercial hub.

### Scale

| Period | Population | Notes |
|--------|------------|-------|
| Pre-Passing | ~25,000 | Primarily human, with significant elf merchant presence |
| Post-Passing | ~12,000 | Trade reduced but continuing |

### Character

Where Aurhalion is ethereal and beautiful, Portus Solis is practical and profitable. The architecture is Imperial standard—warehouses, customs houses, shipyards—with little Goleuwyr influence beyond the golden limestone used in construction. This is where the Pale connects to the wider world: merchants from Portus Aureus, traders from Shiranui, occasional Dragon-kin factors from Tyrlóng, and representatives of a dozen smaller ports.

The human population here has always been more comfortable with elves than most Imperial citizens. Generations of profitable cooperation breed tolerance. But they've also been more exposed to Church teaching, and the tension between business sense and religious conviction creates complicated attitudes.

### Notable Features

**The Consortium Docks:** Twenty major berths plus countless smaller moorings. Before the Passing, ships waited weeks for dock space. Now, many berths sit empty—but trade continues. The Pale's relative stability makes it attractive to merchants willing to brave the sea-routes.

**The Customs House of Light:** An Imperial building with Goleuwyr additions—Sunhold crystals illuminate the interior, reducing the traditional corruption of dark-corner deals. Merchants joke that you can't hide anything from the tax collectors here, not even in shadow.

**The Sailor's Rest:** An enormous inn-and-tavern complex serving the port. Rooms for every budget, food from a dozen cuisines, and a back room where information trades as freely as goods. The proprietor, a one-armed former captain named Marcus Brightwater, knows everything that moves through the port.

### Current Situation

The port survives because the sea-routes remain safer than overland travel. Ships from Portus Aureus arrive weekly; occasional vessels from Shiranui still make the crossing. The Consortium—reduced from twenty trading houses to seven—maintains operations through grim determination.

The main problem is labor. The plague killed many dockworkers; others fled to Aurhalion seeking the city's apparent protection. The remaining workers demand higher wages, and there aren't enough of them anyway. Ships sometimes wait days for unloading.

**The Thalaurion Question:** Ships used to sail regularly between Portus Solis and the island-city of Thalaurion. The island has closed its waters—vessels approaching are turned back by light-magic that blinds crews and confuses navigation. No one from Thalaurion has visited the mainland since. The merchants who specialized in that trade are ruined.

---

## 2. Goleufryn — Light-Hill

**Imperial Registry:** Lucis Collis (rarely used)
**Local Name:** Goleufryn (goh-LAY-vrin)
**Common Names:** The Bright Town, Little Aurhalion

### Location

Twenty miles inland from Aurhalion, where the coastal hills rise toward the interior highlands. Goleufryn sits atop a hill that catches the setting sun, creating a beacon visible for miles. The town commands the main road connecting the Pale to the eastern Heartland.

### Type

Mixed human-elf market town and waystation.

### Scale

| Period | Population | Notes |
|--------|------------|-------|
| Pre-Passing | ~8,000 | Roughly equal human and elf populations |
| Post-Passing | ~5,000 | More elf survivors than human |

### Character

Goleufryn is what centuries of coexistence produces: a genuinely hybrid community where the distinction between "human quarter" and "elf quarter" has blurred into irrelevance. Families here are often mixed—not half-elves (which are rare and complicated) but humans and elves who have lived as neighbors so long they've adopted each other's customs.

The architecture reflects this blending. Human-style timber frames support roofs angled to catch light in Goleuwyr fashion. Market stalls sell both Imperial goods and elven crystal-work. The local festival calendar includes both Church holidays and Light-traditions, often celebrated by everyone regardless of heritage.

### Notable Features

**The Sunset Stone (Carreg Machlud):** A standing stone at the town's highest point, predating both human and elf settlement. Local tradition holds it was placed by Fae in the distant past. At sunset on certain days, the stone casts a shadow pointing toward something—no one agrees what, but theories range from hidden treasure to the entrance to Faerie.

**The Waystation Market:** A weekly market drawing farmers, herders, and traders from the surrounding countryside. Before the Passing, caravans from the Heartland stopped here to trade for Pale goods before continuing to Aurhalion or Portus Solis. Now the caravans are fewer, but the market continues—local agriculture has become more important as long-distance trade falters.

**The House of Welcome (Tŷ Croeso):** An inn-temple hybrid run by a joint human-elf family. The building serves as waystation, neutral meeting ground, and worship space—services honor both Light tradition and (quietly) the Theosyn gods the Church absorbed. The current proprietor, Grandmother Eluned, has mediated disputes in Goleufryn for sixty years.

### Current Situation

Goleufryn has become a refuge for those who don't fit elsewhere. Humans uncomfortable with Church persecution of elves. Elves too integrated with human society to feel at home in purely Goleuwyr settlements. Mixed families who faced suspicion in Imperial cities. The town has grown slightly despite the Passing, absorbing those who need a place that doesn't demand clear categories.

The challenge is resources. More people mean more mouths, and the agricultural hinterland wasn't developed to support this population. Food prices have risen. Some newcomers have taken to farming abandoned lands nearby, but clearing the Reft from those lands is dangerous work.

**The Road Problem:** The Via Orientalis, connecting the Pale to the Heartland, passes through Goleufryn. The road has become dangerous—Reft in the passes, bandits in the valleys, no Imperial patrols. Trade caravans now require armed escort. Some merchants have stopped coming entirely.

---

## 3. Sanctum Lucis — The Sanctuary of Light

**Imperial Registry:** Sanctum Lucis
**Local Name:** Cysegr Golau (kuh-SEG-ur GOH-lie)
**Common Names:** The Sanctuary, The Monastery Town

### Location

Fifteen miles north of Aurhalion, in a valley where hot springs create year-round warmth. The springs feed pools that steam in winter and remain warm in summer, creating a microclimate that supports unusual vegetation. The valley was sacred to Light-tradition long before the Church arrived.

### Type

Monastery town and pilgrimage site.

### Scale

| Period | Population | Notes |
|--------|------------|-------|
| Pre-Passing | ~6,000 | Monastery (~500), support population (~5,500) |
| Post-Passing | ~3,500 | Monastery reduced (~200), town contracted |

### Character

Sanctum Lucis represents the Church's most successful attempt to establish authority in the Pale—and its most complete theological failure. The monastery was founded three centuries ago to bring "true light" to the "benighted" elves. Instead, the monks gradually absorbed more Light-tradition than they spread Church doctrine.

Today, the monastery practices a faith that would horrify Vandgwyn. They venerate Saint Aldric, yes—but they also know his true name was Phaelon. They perform Church liturgy, but their understanding of the Light draws from sources the Church has tried to suppress. They maintain cordial relations with the Temple of the Unconquered Sun in Aurhalion, much to the scandal of more orthodox churchmen.

The town that grew around the monastery serves pilgrims, patients seeking the healing springs, and the various enterprises a monastery generates (breweries, scriptoria, gardens). The population is primarily human, but elves visit regularly—often officially seeking healing, actually conferring with sympathetic monks about theological matters.

### Notable Features

**The Monastery of the Illuminated Way (Mynachlog y Ffordd Oleuni):** A sprawling complex of chapels, dormitories, healing halls, and libraries. The architecture mixes Imperial church style with clear Goleuwyr influences—pointed arches that direct light, windows oriented to catch dawn and dusk. The main chapel contains a crystal that was *definitely* made by elven craftsmen, whatever the official records claim.

**The Healing Springs (Ffynhonnau Iachau):** Natural hot springs believed to have Light-healing properties. Patients come from across the East seeking cures for ailments ranging from physical wounds to spiritual corruption. The waters do seem to help—whether through natural minerals, Light-magic, or simply hope.

**The Archive of Reconciliation:** A hidden library within the monastery containing texts that attempt to reconcile Church doctrine with Light-tradition. Many of these texts are technically heretical. The Abbess keeps them locked away, available only to trusted scholars.

### Current Situation

The Passing devastated the monastery. Many monks died; others lost faith. The current community is smaller but paradoxically more honest—those who remained did so because their faith was real, not because they had nowhere else to go.

**Abbess Celestine:** The monastery's leader is a remarkable woman of seventy who has spent her life walking the line between Church orthodoxy and Light-truth. She survived the Passing by leading her community in prayers that drew on both traditions. She will not discuss what she saw during those terrible days, but she no longer pretends that Church doctrine explains everything.

**The Healing Demand:** The springs attract desperate survivors—people wounded by Reft, people seeking purification from plague-fear, people simply needing hope. The monastery cannot accommodate everyone. They've had to turn people away, and some of those turned away have grown resentful.

**The Inquisition Shadow:** The Scouring has not reached the Pale in force—yet. But Abbess Celestine knows that her monastery's *accommodating* theology makes it a target. She's quietly preparing: hiding the most dangerous texts, establishing escape routes for scholars, building relationships with elves who might offer sanctuary.

---

## 4. Caer Heulwen — Sun-Fort

**Imperial Registry:** Castrum Solis
**Local Name:** Caer Heulwen (kire HAY-loo-en)
**Common Names:** Sun-Fort, The Eastern Shield

### Location

Thirty miles south of Aurhalion, where the coastal road enters the Pale from Golden Coast territory. The fortress commands a pass between coastal hills and interior highlands—anyone approaching Aurhalion from the south must pass through Caer Heulwen's territory.

### Type

Fortress town and garrison.

### Scale

| Period | Population | Notes |
|--------|------------|-------|
| Pre-Passing | ~4,000 | Garrison (~800), civilians (~3,200) |
| Post-Passing | ~2,500 | Reduced garrison (~400), contracted town |

### Character

Built by the Empire to remind the Pale that Imperial authority existed, Caer Heulwen has always had an uncomfortable position. The garrison was supposed to enforce Imperial law; in practice, they mostly kept the peace and collected modest tolls from travelers. The soldiers came to appreciate the Pale's relative tolerance—many married local women, some converted (quietly) to Light-tradition.

The fortress itself is impressive: thick walls, well-designed towers, a position that would make siege extremely difficult. But it was built to defend against armies, and armies aren't the problem now.

### Notable Features

**The Sun Gate (Porth yr Haul):** The fortress's main entrance, oriented east to catch the rising sun. The gate's design incorporates Light-elements—crystalline inlays that flash blinding light at attackers, arrow-slits that somehow never seem to let defenders be silhouetted. Nobody is certain whether these features were part of the original Imperial design or added later by elf engineers.

**The Signal Tower (Tŵr Arwydd):** A lighthouse-style tower using Sunhold technology to signal warnings. Before the Passing, the tower coordinated with similar towers along the coast, creating a communication network spanning the East. Most of the network is now dark; Caer Heulwen's tower still burns.

**The Veteran's Quarter:** A district where retired soldiers settled. Many are second or third generation garrison families, more Pale than Imperial in their loyalties. They've become the backbone of local defense, organizing patrols and training younger fighters.

### Current Situation

Commander Gaius Aurelius Tertius commands a garrison that answers to... no one, really. The Emperor is gone. The regional military command has collapsed. Gaius has decided his duty is to protect the people who live here, regardless of what symbols they pray to.

**The Reft Patrol:** The garrison's primary mission now is keeping the roads clear. Reft concentrate in the hills south of the fortress—Burning Reft and Shadow Reft, a dangerous combination. Patrols go out daily; not all come back.

**The Refugee Flow:** Survivors from the devastated Golden Coast trickle through, heading for Aurhalion. Gaius processes them: basic health check (looking for plague signs), questions about origin and intention, warning about local customs. Some refugees are grateful; others resent being examined by soldiers who *clearly* have elf-lovers in their ranks.

**The Toll Question:** Traditionally, the fortress collected tolls from merchants using the road. Should that continue? The merchants who remain are barely surviving. But the garrison needs supplies, and their Imperial pay certainly isn't coming anymore. Gaius has instituted a sliding scale—wealthy merchants pay; desperate refugees don't—but the system satisfies no one completely.

# Part Three: Notable Sites

## 1. The Mirror Mere (Llyn Drych)

### Location

Seven miles inland from Aurhalion, in a valley cupped between three hills. The mere is small—perhaps half a mile across—but unnaturally still. Its surface reflects the sky so perfectly that first-time visitors have walked into the water thinking it was solid ground.

### Type

Sacred site (Light-tradition), natural wonder

### History

The Mirror Mere predates Goleuwyr settlement. When the elves first came to this land, fleeing the devastation of the Light realm, they found the mere already here—already sacred to someone. Fae memory suggests the site was significant even before the God-Giant War.

The Goleuwyr adopted the mere as their holiest natural site. They believe its perfect reflection represents the Light realm as it once was: pure, undistorted, complete. They come here to remember what they lost.

### Current State

The mere remains perfectly still despite wind, despite rain, despite any natural force that should disturb water. Visitors report that looking into the mere shows not just reflection but *possibility*—glimpses of how things could be, how they should be, how they might have been.

Since the Passing, the mere has changed. The reflections are still perfect, but sometimes they show things that aren't in the sky—structures, faces, places that shouldn't exist. Some elves believe the mere is showing them the Light realm itself. Others fear it's showing something worse.

**The Guardians:** A small community of Goleuwyr maintains the site. They permit respectful human visitors but discourage anyone from touching the water. Those who have touched it report dreams of blinding light and overwhelming loss.

### The Hook

Someone has been visiting the mere at night. Tracks lead to the water's edge but not away—as if visitors walked into the mere and didn't return. The guardians are frightened. They've sent word to Aurhalion, but the Light-Lord hasn't responded. They're looking for outsiders discreet enough to investigate without causing panic.

---

## 2. The Sunken Spires (Tyrau Suddedig)

### Location

Offshore from Portus Solis, visible at low tide as dark shapes beneath the waves. At extremely low tides—occurring perhaps twice a year—the tops of ruined towers break the surface.

### Type

Submerged ruins (ancient Goleuwyr), maritime hazard

### History

Before Aurhalion existed, before the Pale was settled, another Goleuwyr city stood here. The Sunken Spires are all that remains.

Records differ on what happened. Some accounts say the city was destroyed during the God-Giant War. Others suggest it sank during the great earthquake that reshaped the eastern coast centuries ago. A few texts hint at something darker—that the city was deliberately drowned by its own inhabitants to prevent something from escaping.

### Current State

The spires are a navigation hazard; ships that stray too close risk tearing their hulls on submerged masonry. Local sailors know the safe channels.

More concerning are the lights. At night, faint illumination sometimes rises from the depths—too steady for bioluminescence, too bright for natural reflection. The lights move. They pulse. Sometimes they form patterns that older elves recognize as words in a language no longer spoken.

Since the Passing, the lights have grown more frequent. Fishermen report seeing shapes moving among the spires—not fish, not seals, something humanoid. One boat captain claims he heard singing from beneath the waves, unbearably beautiful and deeply wrong.

**The Archaeologist's Request:** A scholar from the Academy of Luminous Arts wants to dive the Sunken Spires and recover artifacts. She's assembling a team—divers, security, someone who can read ancient Goleuwyr script. The Light-Lord has refused to sponsor the expedition. She's looking for independent backing.

### The Hook

A ship recently wrecked on the Sunken Spires during a storm. Survivors report that *something* came up from the ruins—humanoid shapes that glowed with golden light. The shapes rescued some sailors, pulling them from the water and depositing them on shore. Other sailors vanished, carried down into the depths, and haven't been seen since.

---

## 3. The Cathedral of Saint Aldric the Illuminator

### Location

Imperial Quarter, Aurhalion. The largest Church structure in the Pale.

### Type

Cathedral (Solarian Church), theological irony

### History

Built four centuries ago to establish Church authority in "heretic" territory. Named for Saint Aldric—the Church's sanitized version of Phaelon, an actual Theosyn god of Light whom the Church subsumed into their monotheistic framework.

The cathedral was designed to impress: towering spires, magnificent windows, all the architectural vocabulary of Church power. But the builders were local, and many were elves or humans sympathetic to Light-tradition. They incorporated elements the Church commissioners didn't recognize—solar geometries, Light-channeling architecture, proportions drawn from elf rather than human bodies.

The result is a building that *should* be a monument to Church authority but instead serves as inadvertent proof that Light-tradition preceded and will outlast the Church.

### Current State

The cathedral still functions, though much reduced. The pre-Passing clergy of thirty priests has dwindled to eight. Most of the congregation fled or died. Services continue—partly from habit, partly because the remaining priests don't know what else to do.

Bishop Alaric Sunbright, the cathedral's leader, is having a crisis of faith. He's spent forty years preaching Church doctrine in a city where everyone knows the doctrine is wrong. He justified this to himself by focusing on shared truths—surely both traditions worship the same Light? But the Passing has forced harder questions. If the Church's theology was correct, why couldn't the Church prevent the catastrophe? Why did elves survive better than humans? What if everything he taught was not merely incomplete but *backwards*?

**The Devil's Door:** The cathedral's north-facing door remains unsealed. By ancient agreement, elves may enter through this door to observe services. The arrangement is unofficial, unacknowledged, and everyone knows about it. Some nights, the door serves opposite purpose—humans slip through to attend services at the Temple of the Unconquered Sun.

### The Hook

Bishop Alaric has approached the Academy of Luminous Arts with an extraordinary request: he wants to learn Light-tradition from elven teachers. This would be heresy of the highest order—but what does that mean when the Office of Sacred Purity can't reach the Pale? The Academy is divided. Some see an opportunity for reconciliation; others see a trap. They're looking for someone to investigate the Bishop's sincerity.

## 4. The Veiled Grove (Llwyn Orchudd)

### Location

Hills behind Aurhalion, past the highest terraces. A small valley hidden by a ridge, accessible only by paths the Goleuwyr have never mapped.

### Type

Fae site, threshold location

### History

The Veiled Grove belongs to the Fae—specifically, to a small community of Geal-sí (Bright Fae) who made their home in this land before elves or humans arrived. They remember things others have forgotten.

The Goleuwyr know the Grove exists. They leave offerings at its borders—flowers, crystals, small light-objects. In return, the Fae occasionally share knowledge: warnings of danger, hints about forgotten magic, cryptic guidance that usually proves useful in retrospect.

Humans learned of the Grove only recently. A few—very few—have been permitted to enter. Those who return speak of conversations with beings who think in timescales that make even elves seem hurried.

### Current State

Since the Passing, the Fae have been more active. They've appeared in Aurhalion itself—something that hadn't happened in centuries. They seem agitated, worried about something they won't name directly.

The Grove's borders have shifted. Paths that once approached the ridge now loop back on themselves. The Fae are either strengthening their defenses or preparing for something.

**The Message:** A Fae messenger recently appeared in the Mirror Palace, demanding audience with the Light-Lord. The message was delivered but has not been shared. Caradoc Goleufer has been even more withdrawn since receiving it. Rumors suggest the Fae warned of something coming—something that the Passing disturbed or awakened.

### The Hook

A young elf researcher has made contact with the Veiled Grove's inhabitants. They've offered her knowledge of something called "the Forgetting"—but the price is service. She needs help fulfilling what they've asked: retrieving an object from the Sunken Spires. She can't do it alone, and she's not sure she should do it at all.

---

# Part Four: Key Figures

## 1. Caradoc Goleufer, Light-Lord of Aurhalion

**Full Name and Titles:** Caradoc ap Eirlys Goleufer, Light-Lord of Aurhalion, Guardian of the Morning, Keeper of the Dawn-Stone, Elder of the Assembly of Lights

**Role:** Traditional ruler of the Goleuwyr in Aurhalion and nominal sovereign of the Elvish Pale

### Character

Caradoc is ancient—over eight hundred years old, with clear memory of times most humans consider myth. He watched the Solarian Church rise from an obscure cult to continental dominance. He negotiated the Incorporation that brought the Pale under Imperial authority while preserving elven autonomy. He has outlived human empires, human religions, human certainties.

He is tired.

Not physically—Goleuwyr age slowly and maintain their faculties almost until the end. But spiritually, Caradoc feels the weight of centuries. He has made so many compromises to keep his people safe. He has watched so many human generations rise, flourish, fade. He has pretended not to know truths that would have destroyed careful arrangements.

**Appearance:** Tall even for an elf, with silver-gold hair and eyes that shift from pale gold to deep amber depending on light. His skin has the luminous quality all Goleuwyr share, but seems to glow more intensely—as if long life has concentrated his Light-nature. He moves with deliberate grace, each gesture economical and precise.

**Manner:** Formally courteous, guardedly warm. He speaks Imperial Latin perfectly but prefers his native tongue. He asks questions more than he makes statements. He remembers everything but acknowledges little.

### Goal

Survival. Not just his own survival—the survival of his people, his city, the fragile arrangement that has protected them for centuries.

Caradoc knows the old balance is broken. The Empire that guaranteed elven autonomy is gone. The Church that could have destroyed them is fragmenting but not dead. The Passing has revealed truths that were safer hidden.

He wants to navigate this chaos without losing everything his predecessors built. He wants to find a path that doesn't require choosing between hiding forever and emerging into violent backlash.

### Complication

The factions pull him in incompatible directions.

The Hidden urge patience—wait, watch, maintain discretion. This is what Caradoc knows best. But the Hidden strategy depends on outside threats remaining stable enough to manage. The Passing destroyed that stability.

The Revealed urge emergence—the Church is broken, the Empire is gone, now is the time to reclaim their heritage openly. Caradoc sympathizes but fears the consequences. Human fear of elves hasn't disappeared with the institutions that channeled it.

The Bitter urge withdrawal—expel humans, close the borders, let the outside world destroy itself. Caradoc considers this both immoral and impractical. The Pale cannot survive in isolation.

And now the Fae have sent a message. Something about the Forgotten Sister. Something about what the Passing disturbed. Something that makes all his careful political calculations seem irrelevant.

---

## 2. Lady Serena Valerius Lux, Imperial Governor

**Full Name and Titles:** Serena Valerius Lux, Governor of the Elvish Pale by Imperial Appointment, Lady of House Valerius, Consul Hereditaria

**Role:** Official Imperial authority in the Pale (largely ceremonial); practical administrator of human affairs

### Character

Serena inherited a position designed to be symbolic and has been forced to make it functional. Her family served as Governors for three generations, maintaining the polite fiction of Imperial sovereignty while the Light-Lord actually ruled. Serena expected to continue this arrangement—attend ceremonies, sign documents, enjoy the comfortable life of a noble administrator.

The Passing changed everything.

Now she coordinates refugee management, mediates disputes between human factions, maintains what's left of law enforcement, and pretends to authority she doesn't have. She does this while knowing that her legitimacy died with the Empire, that the Church that might have supported her claims views the Pale as heretic territory, and that the elves tolerate her only because she's useful.

**Appearance:** Fifty years old, graying dark hair usually pinned severely back. She wears Imperial formal dress—a deliberate choice, maintaining the appearance of authority even as its substance evaporates. Her face shows the strain: lines around eyes and mouth that weren't there three years ago.

**Manner:** Briskly competent, carefully neutral. She's learned not to express opinions about elven nature, Church theology, or factional disputes. She focuses on practical problems—food distribution, road security, plague prevention—because practical problems have practical solutions.

### Goal

Keep people alive. All the people, human and elf, who depend on the Pale's continued function.

Serena has no illusions about her position. She's useful to the Light-Lord because she handles human problems that would otherwise distract from elven concerns. She's useful to humans because she provides a familiar authority figure in unfamiliar times. The moment she stops being useful, she becomes irrelevant.

So she remains useful. She solves problems. She mediates disputes. She keeps the administrative apparatus functioning when everywhere else it's collapsed.

### Complication

The Scouring is coming.

Serena's contacts in the Golden Coast have warned her: the militant Church faction that's burning "heretics" throughout the Empire has noticed the Pale. They see a territory that shelters "soulless" elves, practices "heathen" Light-worship, and harbors a monastery of "accommodating" theology. They see targets.

The Scouring hasn't arrived yet—they're busy elsewhere, and the sea voyage is dangerous. But they're coming. When they arrive, Serena will have to choose: maintain her careful neutrality (and watch people burn), openly oppose the Church (and destroy her remaining legitimacy), or flee (and abandon everyone who depends on her).

She's been having quiet conversations with the Light-Lord about defensive preparations. She's not sure he takes the threat seriously enough.

---

## 3. Eira Goleli, Light-Singer

**Full Name:** Eira ferch Gwydion Goleli (AY-ra verch GWID-ee-on goh-LEL-ee)
**Common Name:** Eira Light-Singer
**Epithet:** The Voice of Morning

**Role:** Artist, cultural figure, and (increasingly) factional symbol

### Character

Eira is young for an elf—barely two hundred years old, which in Goleuwyr terms means she's just reaching full maturity. She grew up entirely within the compromise, never knowing the Light realm, never practicing her heritage openly, always hiding what she was behind careful neutrality.

She is done hiding.

Eira is a singer. Her voice channels Light-magic in ways that shouldn't be possible—when she sings, objects glow, wounds heal, despair lifts. She discovered this ability as a child and was immediately taught to suppress it. Public display of such obvious elf-magic would draw dangerous attention.

She suppressed it for decades. Then the Passing came, and her singing was the only thing that kept her neighborhood from falling to despair during those terrible days. She sang in the streets, openly, defiantly, and people—human and elf—gathered around her light.

She hasn't stopped since.

**Appearance:** Young-looking by elf standards (appearing perhaps twenty-five in human terms), with copper-gold hair and amber eyes that glow visibly when she sings. She dresses in ways that emphasize rather than hide her heritage: flowing garments in sunrise colors, crystal jewelry that catches light, nothing that could be mistaken for human fashion.

**Manner:** Passionate, impatient, charismatic. She speaks the way she sings—with intensity that makes listeners feel they're receiving something precious. She has limited patience for political calculation and even less for what she calls "performative human-ness."

### Goal

Recognition. Not for herself—for her people.

Eira believes the Goleuwyr have hidden long enough. She wants elves to practice their traditions openly, to walk through cities without pretending to be something less than they are, to be known for what they actually are: children of the Light.

She's become the visible face of the Revealed faction, though she holds no formal position. Her songs draw crowds. Her public performances in the Festival Grounds have become rallies for emergence. Young elves flock to her; older ones worry.

### Complication

Eira's gifts come from somewhere she doesn't understand.

Her Light-magic is stronger than it should be. She can do things no living Goleuwyr can match—things from the old stories, abilities that supposedly died with the Light realm. She doesn't know why.

The Fae have taken an interest. They've sent her dreams—visions of the Forgetting, hints about the Youngest Sister, fragments of a story that seems to concern her specifically. She's told no one about these dreams because they frighten her.

And lately, when she sings, she sometimes hears another voice harmonizing. A voice that isn't in the room. A voice that feels like hope given sound.

# Part Five: Local Conditions

## The Reft Situation

### Prevalence

The Elvish Pale has **lower Reft concentration** than most Imperial territory. This relative safety has drawn refugees and prompted uncomfortable questions about elven nature.

| Area | Density | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| Aurhalion city | Very Low | Wards, patrols, Light-magic |
| Within 10 miles of Aurhalion | Low | Regular clearing, defended roads |
| Pale countryside | Low-Moderate | Higher than cities, lower than Empire average |
| Border regions | Moderate | Concentrations at passes and roads |
| Sunken Spires area | Unknown | Reports of something, not clearly Reft |

### Predominant Types

| Type | Frequency | Location |
|------|-----------|----------|
| Burning Reft | Common | Hills, passes—drawn to Light-sites |
| Shadow Reft | Moderate | Darker valleys, especially near borders |
| Empty Reft | Rare | Near Fae sites—disturbing implications |
| Other types | Occasional | Refugees bring them from elsewhere |

The predominance of Burning Reft creates a theological problem. These Reft are drawn to light, corrupted by the Light-field itself. Does this mean the Light can be corrupted? Or does it mean the plague attacked what the people of this land valued most? Scholars debate; ordinary people just want them gone.

### Clearing Efforts

The garrison at Caer Heulwen conducts regular patrols. Aurhalion maintains a defensive perimeter. Individual towns organize their own protection.

The most effective Reft-clearers are Goleuwyr who combine martial training with Light-magic. Their techniques seem to *purify* rather than merely destroy—suggesting the plague victims might actually be healed if anyone understood the process better. Research is ongoing at the Academy of Luminous Arts.

---

## Travel

### The Roads

| Route | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Aurhalion to Portus Solis | Good | Causeway road, regular traffic |
| Aurhalion to Caer Heulwen | Moderate | Military patrols, tolled |
| Aurhalion to Goleufryn | Fair | Local maintenance, some risks |
| Via Orientalis (to Heartland) | Dangerous | Reft in passes, bandits |
| Coastal road (south to Golden Coast) | Moderate | Better since Caer Heulwen garrison |

### Maritime Routes

| Route | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Portus Solis to Portus Aureus | Active | Weekly sailings, expensive |
| Portus Solis to Eastern Islands | Reduced | Piracy concerns, irregular |
| Portus Solis to Thalaurion | Closed | Island has sealed its waters |

### Movement Patterns

- **Locals:** Travel between settlements is manageable with basic precautions
- **Refugees:** Arrive via sea (from Golden Coast) or overland (from Heartland); both routes dangerous
- **Merchants:** Reduced but continuing; sea transport strongly preferred
- **Pilgrims:** Traffic to Sanctum Lucis continues; healing springs draw desperate seekers

---

## Trade

### Exports

| Good | Volume | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Crystal-work | Reduced | Luxury market collapsed, but demand continues |
| Light-textiles | Reduced | Woven with Light-magic; valuable for magical properties |
| Preserved fish | Steady | Sea routes maintain coastal trade |
| Scholarly services | Increased | Academy expertise in demand |

### Imports

| Good | Volume | Source | Notes |
|------|--------|--------|-------|
| Grain | Critical | Heartland (overland), Delta (sea) | Food security major concern |
| Metals | Reduced | Various | Weapon and tool production limited |
| Medicines | Increased | Tyrlóng, Shiranui | Plague responses, healing supplies |
| Refugees | Increasing | Everywhere | Human capital, also burden |

### Trade Control

The Merchant Consortium—reduced from twenty houses to seven—coordinates major commerce. Individual merchants handle smaller trade. Tariffs have been reduced to encourage supply chains. Lady Serena's administration manages customs at Portus Solis.

---

## Religion

### What's Official

The Solarian Church is the Empire's official religion. The Cathedral of Saint Aldric represents Church authority in the Pale.

### What's Actually Practiced

| Tradition | Practitioners | Status |
|-----------|---------------|--------|
| Light-tradition (Goleuwyr) | All elves, some humans | Openly practiced; officially "heresy" |
| Solarian Church | Many humans, few elves | Declining presence and authority |
| Theosyn worship | Underground | Growing since Passing; the "Saints" remembered as gods |
| Folk/Fae practices | Rural areas | Always present, increasingly open |
| Hybrid practices | Mixed communities | Common in Twilight Quarter, Goleufryn |

The Cathedral maintains services. The Temple of the Unconquered Sun conducts its rituals. Many residents attend both, or neither, or practice private devotions that draw from multiple sources. Theological consistency matters less than survival.

### The Theological Crisis

The Church taught that Light would protect the faithful. The Passing proved this wrong. Meanwhile, elves—who the Church calls "soulless"—survived better than humans. The theological implications are explosive, which is why no one discusses them openly.

Some humans have quietly converted to Light-tradition. Some have lost faith entirely. Some cling more fiercely to Church doctrine, blaming elven "corruption" for their suffering.

The Inquisition has not reached the Pale in force. When it does, these simmering tensions will ignite.

---

## The Scars

The Passing left marks on reality—places where the fabric of existence tore and hasn't fully healed.

### The Silence of the Deep Road

A stretch of the Via Orientalis, about three miles long, where no sound can be heard. Travelers pass through in eerie quiet—their footsteps, their voices, even their heartbeats inaudible. The silence does no physical harm, but many refuse to cross it.

The silence appeared during the Passing. Some think an eldritch creature passed through here and the sound hasn't recovered. Others think the silence is a mercy—that something happened in those three miles that should never be heard.

### The Reflection Fault

A valley inland from Portus Solis where reflections don't behave properly. Mirrors show slightly different images than their sources. Water reflects skies that don't match the actual sky. People who linger too long report seeing their reflections move independently.

Since the Passing, some reflections have started showing places that don't exist—or places that exist but shouldn't be visible from here. One traveler claims to have seen the Light realm in a puddle. She hasn't been the same since.

### The Singing Hill

A promontory near Goleufryn that produces musical tones when the wind blows. This happened before the Passing, but the music has changed. The old tones were pleasant, even beautiful. The new tones are discordant, unsettling, like an instrument struggling to remember how it used to sound.

Locals avoid the hill now. Those who've climbed it report finding crystal formations that weren't there before—growths that pulse with inner light and feel warm to the touch.

---

# Part Six: Adventure Hooks

## 1. The Consortium's Dilemma

**Situation:** The Merchant Consortium needs to reestablish trade with the Heartland, but the Via Orientalis has become too dangerous for regular caravans. They're considering an alternative: a northern route through the Hintercoast that would bypass the worst Reft concentrations.

**The Problem:** The northern route passes through territory nobody's mapped since before the Passing. It also passes near the Veiled Grove, and the Consortium needs to know if the Fae will permit commercial traffic through their sphere.

**The Hook:** The Consortium offers substantial payment for a team to scout the northern route, assess its dangers, and make contact with the Veiled Grove's inhabitants. Success could transform the Pale's economic position. Failure might mean never returning.

**Complications:** The Fae don't think in commercial terms. They might demand strange prices for passage rights. And the northern territory may contain surprises nobody anticipated.

---

## 2. The Bishop's Confession

**Situation:** Bishop Alaric of Saint Aldric's Cathedral has requested a private audience—not with Church authorities (there aren't any functioning ones nearby), but with scholars of Light-tradition. He wants to understand what he's been getting wrong all his life.

**The Problem:** If this is sincere, it represents an extraordinary opportunity for reconciliation. If it's a trap—designed to identify heretics for future persecution—it could destroy the fragile tolerance the Pale has maintained.

**The Hook:** The Academy of Luminous Arts wants independent parties to assess Bishop Alaric's sincerity before committing their scholars. They need people who can read human motivations, withstand Church authority, and keep their mouths shut regardless of what they discover.

**Complications:** Bishop Alaric is sincere—but not everyone in his cathedral shares his crisis of faith. Some of his remaining priests are true believers who would report heresy if they discovered their Bishop's intentions. And the Inquisition has agents the Bishop doesn't know about.

---

## 3. Songs from the Sunken Spires

**Situation:** Fishermen report increasing activity around the Sunken Spires—lights, movement, singing from beneath the waves. A ship recently wrecked on the spires; survivors describe being rescued by glowing humanoid figures, while other sailors were taken below and haven't returned.

**The Problem:** Nobody knows what lives in the Sunken Spires. The ruins predate current Goleuwyr settlement—records suggest the original city was deliberately destroyed. Whatever's waking up may not be friendly.

**The Hook:** A scholar from the Academy has assembled funding for an expedition to investigate the Spires. She needs divers, security, and ideally someone who can read pre-Incorporation Goleuwyr script. The Light-Lord has refused to sponsor the expedition, which may mean it's too dangerous or may mean the elves are hiding something.

**Complications:** The entities in the Spires seem to be Goleuwyr—or something that was Goleuwyr, long ago. They may have answers about elven history that current elves don't want discovered. And they seem to be calling to something—or someone—on land.

---

## 4. The Fae Message

**Situation:** The Fae have sent a message to the Light-Lord that has left him deeply disturbed. He won't share its contents, but his behavior has changed—he's withdrawn from public affairs and seems to be preparing for something.

**The Problem:** Caradoc Goleufer has ruled Aurhalion for centuries. If he's frightened, everyone should be frightened. But without knowing what the message said, no one can prepare appropriately.

**The Hook:** Someone needs to either convince the Light-Lord to share what he knows, or find another way to learn what the Fae communicated. The Veiled Grove might answer questions—but the Fae never answer directly, and their prices are unpredictable.

**Complications:** The Fae message concerns the "Forgetting"—Katiari, the Youngest Sister, the goddess who erased herself to protect the world. The Light-Lord knows fragments of this secret because Goleuwyr history remembers things humanity has forgotten. He's terrified because the Fae suggested that something about the Passing has disturbed Katiari's hiding place.

---

## 5. The Singer's Shadow

**Situation:** Eira Light-Singer has become the most visible figure of the Revealed faction. Her public performances draw huge crowds. Her songs have effects that exceed any known Light-magic. She's become a symbol of elven emergence—which makes her a target.

**The Problem:** Someone is following Eira. She's noticed shadows that shouldn't be there, heard footsteps that stop when she turns around. She suspects agents of the Scouring have reached the Pale ahead of their main force, scouting targets for future action.

**The Hook:** Eira needs protection, but she refuses to stop performing—hiding is exactly what she's rebelling against. She needs people who can guard her without making her look weak, investigate who's following her, and help her understand the strange dreams she's been having about a voice that harmonizes with her song.

**Complications:** The followers aren't from the Scouring. They're from a faction Eira doesn't know exists—the Bitter, radical elves who believe her emergence movement will bring catastrophe on their people. They're not trying to hurt her (yet), but they're watching, gathering evidence, preparing arguments for why she should be stopped.

Meanwhile, Eira's dreams are real. Something is trying to communicate with her through her music. That something might be hope itself—or might be something wearing hope's face.

---
