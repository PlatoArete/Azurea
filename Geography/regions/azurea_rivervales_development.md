# Azurea: Rivervales Sub-Region Development
## Regio Fluvialis — The Vales

---

# Overview

The Rivervales occupy the transitional zone between the elevated Crown Lands and the flat expanses of the Grainmarch. Here, multiple river valleys descend from the Altheim Plateau through increasingly gentle terrain, converging at natural junction points that have served as trade crossroads since before the Empire's founding. The region functions as the Empire's commercial arteries—where goods from the Crown Lands meet those bound for Grannaria and beyond, where upstream meets downstream, where highland meets lowland.

**Imperial Name:** Regio Fluvialis  
**Local Name:** The Vales  
**Capital:** Confluencia  
**City Density:** Moderate-High (1 major city per ~80 miles, linear along rivers)

---

# Part One: The River System

## The Waters of the Vales

The Rivervales are defined by three primary rivers descending from the Altheim Plateau, which meet at Confluencia before continuing as the great Vitawynn toward Grannaria and the broader Grainmarch.

### The Three Tributaries

| River | Meaning | Source | Character |
|-------|---------|--------|-----------|
| **The Clarawynn** | "Clear-River" | Northern edge of Altheim Plateau | Cold, fast, fed by mountain springs; carries mineral-rich water prized by dyers and alchemists |
| **The Arianwynn** | "Silver-River" | Central Altheim Plateau | The largest tributary; major trade artery from Aurheim; wider, slower, bearing heavy barge traffic |
| **The Glaswynn** | "Green-River" | Southern plateau edge near Lawlands | Slower, shallower; passes through older settled territory; water tinted by algae in summer |

### The Outflow

**The Vitawynn** ("Life-River"): Below Confluencia, the three rivers merge into a single broad waterway that flows south through increasingly flat terrain toward Grannaria. This is the Empire's main commercial artery—wider than any road, never blocked by snow, and (until the Passing) safer than any overland route.

# Part Two: The Capital City

## Confluencia — The Meeting of Waters

### Identity

**Imperial Name:** Confluencia  
**Older Name:** Tryffrwd ("Three-Streams" in the old Brythonic tongue, from before Imperial times)  
**Common Names:** The Meeting, The Fork, Three-Waters  

**Location:** Where the Clarawynn, Arianwynn, and Glaswynn converge to form the Vitawynn, approximately 120 miles downstream from the edge of the Altheim Plateau.

**What It's Built On:** The city sprawls across a triangular delta formed by millennia of sediment deposits. The ground is soft, the water table high. No building stands more than four stories without sinking. Instead, the city spreads horizontally across the delta and the low hills on either bank. The oldest districts sit on artificial mounds called *tumuli*—platforms of packed earth and rubble raised above flood level, connected by causeways and bridges.

### Scale

| Measure | Pre-Passing | Post-Passing |
|---------|-------------|--------------|
| **Population** | 95,000 | ~35,000 |
| **Area** | ~4 square miles | Same (but much abandoned) |
| **Annual Trade Value** | Second only to Grannaria in the Heartland | Perhaps 20% of former levels |

### The Five Quarters

Confluencia is divided by water. Bridges connect the districts, but each quarter has its own character.

#### 1. The Delta (Insula Deltae)
The original settlement, built on the highest tumulus where all three rivers meet. Now the administrative and religious center.

**Character:** Ancient, dense, institutional. Stone buildings older than the Empire crowd against each other. The Cathedral of the Flowing Light dominates—its spire visible from every quarter, its bells marking the trading hours.

**Notable Features:**
- **The Trifluvium:** The sacred confluence point itself, where priests once blessed departing cargoes. A stone platform extends into the water where all three rivers touch.
- **The Governor's Hall:** Sprawling administrative complex; nominally still Imperial authority, effectively powerless.
- **The Exchange House:** Where prices were set for goods passing through. Now contested between merchant factions.

#### 2. North Bank (Ripa Borealis)
The quarter facing the Clarawynn, built on the north bank of the Arianwynn.

**Character:** Industrial, practical, grimy. Dyers, tanners, metalworkers—anyone whose trade requires water and produces waste. The Clarawynn's mineral-rich waters made it ideal for certain crafts; the north bank became where those crafts concentrated.

**Notable Features:**
- **The Dye-Works:** Extensive complexes where cloth was colored using Clarawynn minerals. Half-abandoned since the Passing.
- **The Chains:** A slum district named for the chain-ferry that crosses here. Home to day-laborers and the desperate.
- **The Clearwater Shrine:** Ancient spring-fed pool sacred to a pre-Imperial water spirit. Still visited quietly.

#### 3. South Bank (Ripa Australis)
The quarter facing the Glaswynn, built on the south bank of the Arianwynn.

**Character:** Older money, established families, quiet wealth. Merchant houses with generations of history. Gardens running to the water's edge. The district most insulated from chaos—walls went up quickly after the Passing.

**Notable Features:**
- **The Merchant Halls:** Grand houses of the trading dynasties. Some abandoned; others defended like fortresses.
- **The River Gardens:** Public gardens along the Glaswynn, now walled and private.
- **The Quiethouse:** An Ostaran hospice that accepts the dying, regardless of faith. The only building that opens its doors to all.

#### 4. Upriver District (Via Ascendans)
The quarter straddling the Arianwynn above the confluence, on both banks.

**Character:** Warehouses, wharves, and the workers who serve them. Where goods arrive from the Crown Lands. Transient, rougher, more diverse than other quarters. Half the Empire's cultures have representation here among the barge crews.

**Notable Features:**
- **The Stone Wharves:** Massive stone quays extending into the Arianwynn, built to handle heavy cargo.
- **The Barge-Masters' Hall:** Guild headquarters for those who control river traffic. Actual power center of the city.
- **The Pole District:** Named for the bargemen's poles; a maze of cheap lodgings, taverns, and worse.

#### 5. Downriver District (Via Descendans)
The quarter below the confluence, where the Vitawynn begins its journey to Grannaria.

**Character:** Shipyards, repair facilities, chandlers—everything needed to equip vessels for the longer journey downstream. Less wealthy than the Upriver District because goods are *leaving*, not arriving.

**Notable Features:**
- **The Yards:** Where river barges are built and repaired. Skilled labor still available; raw materials scarce.
- **The Counting House:** Where cargoes were assessed for taxation before departure. Now a contested checkpoint.
- **The Silt Temple:** A small shrine to Alys, built on a sandbar that appears and disappears with the river's mood. The sandbar has been stable since the Passing. People find this ominous.

### Atmosphere

**What You See:** Water everywhere. Bridges arching in every direction. Buildings that lean away from waterlogged foundations. Boats of every size from one-person coracles to massive grain barges. Abandoned warehouses with moss climbing their walls. Active warehouses with armed guards. The Cathedral's spire catching morning light.

**What You Smell:** River-mud, always. Fish and rot from the markets. Smoke from workshops still operating. Something sweet and wrong from the abandoned Dye-Works where vats were left full when workers fled.

**What You Hear:** Water—lapping, rushing, dripping. Bridge-traffic footsteps. The cry of river-birds that have grown bold in the quiet. Occasional bells from the Cathedral, marking hours that matter less than they did.

### Who Rules

**In Theory:** Imperial Governor Quintus Marcellinus, appointed fifteen years before the Passing and never replaced.

**In Practice:** Three factions contest control:

1. **The Barge-Masters' Guild:** Led by Guildmaster Helena Varus; controls river traffic, the Upriver District, and most working infrastructure. The closest thing to functional government.

2. **The Merchant Consortium:** An alliance of South Bank trading houses led by the Catullus family. Wealthy, walled, increasingly desperate as trade dries up.

3. **The Flame-Keepers:** A militant religious order claiming to maintain "true faith" in the Cathedral. Not officially part of the Scouring, but trending that direction. Controls the Delta and makes trouble for everyone.

**Governor Marcellinus** maintains nominal authority by being harmless. He signs papers, hosts empty ceremonies, and drinks heavily. All three factions prefer a weak governor to the uncertainty of replacing him.

### The Tension

The rivers still flow—but the goods don't.

Before the Passing, Confluencia existed because trade existed. Grain from the Grainmarch, manufactured goods from the Crown Lands, raw materials from everywhere—all passing through, all paying tolls, all keeping thousands employed.

Now:
- The Crown Lands barely govern themselves; luxury trade has collapsed
- The Grainmarch hoards its grain; shipments are fraction of former levels
- The roads are death; only river transport remains viable
- The population has collapsed but the remaining citizens still need to eat

The city is slowly strangling. The Barge-Masters control what little trade remains, which makes them powerful but hated. The Merchant Consortium has wealth but nothing to buy. The Flame-Keepers preach that suffering is divine punishment, which wins converts among the desperate.

Something has to give. Everyone knows it. No one knows what.

# Part Three: Secondary Settlements

## 1. Pons Altus — The High Bridge

### Identity

**Imperial Name:** Pons Altus  
**Local Name:** Hefelbrwg ("High-Bridge")  
**Type:** Fortress-town controlling river crossing

**Location:** Where the Arianwynn descends through a narrow gorge before entering the Vales proper, approximately 80 miles upstream from Confluencia.

### Character

Pons Altus exists because of the bridge—a massive stone span crossing the Arianwynn at its narrowest point for fifty miles in either direction. The gorge walls rise steeply; the bridge is the only crossing. Whoever holds the bridge controls traffic between the Crown Lands and the Vales.

The town clings to both sides of the gorge, connected by the bridge and by carved stairways descending to river-level wharves. The air is always damp with spray from the rapids below. The sound of rushing water never stops.

**Pre-Passing Population:** 12,000  
**Post-Passing Population:** ~7,000

### Notable Feature: The Toll Tower

A fortified tower at the bridge's midpoint where tolls were collected. Now occupied by Commander Gaius Petronius, a former Imperial officer who has declared himself "Warden of the High Bridge" and charges extortionate rates to anyone crossing.

He's made enemies of everyone—the Barge-Masters, the Merchant Consortium, even the Flame-Keepers. He survives because taking the bridge would cost more than anyone wants to pay, and because he maintains absolute order within his territory. Under his rule, Pons Altus has zero Reft—he executes anyone showing early symptoms.

This is monstrous. This is also effective. People debate which matters more.

---

## 2. Molendinum — The Mill-Town

### Identity

**Imperial Name:** Molendinum  
**Local Name:** Melinfa ("Mill-Place")  
**Type:** Industrial town

**Location:** On the Clarawynn where it descends through a series of rapids, approximately 60 miles upstream from Confluencia. The drop provides exceptional water-power.

### Character

Molendinum was the Heartland's milling center—not just grain-mills, but paper-mills, fulling-mills, saw-mills. Dozens of waterwheels lined both banks, their constant rotation driving machinery of every kind. The town hummed with industry.

Now perhaps a third of the wheels still turn. The grain supply is irregular. The paper-mills sit idle (who needs paper when nobody's writing?). But the saw-mills... those have found new purpose. The demand for coffins has never been higher.

The town is grimmer than it was. The millworkers who remain are gaunt, practical people. They don't waste words. They measure everything—water levels, flour weights, board-feet, bodies.

**Pre-Passing Population:** 18,000  
**Post-Passing Population:** ~8,000

### Notable Feature: The Millmaster's Academy

A training institution for engineers and mechanics established in more prosperous times. Still operating, though barely. Master Lucius Cervinus maintains that knowledge must survive—that someday, someone will need to know how to build mills again. He accepts students who can work; he doesn't ask about their past.

The Academy has become an odd refuge: escaped serfs, disgraced scholars, refugees who understand gears better than swords. They keep the remaining mills running and quietly document everything they can about pre-Passing technology.

---

## 3. Portus Viridis — The Green Port

### Identity

**Imperial Name:** Portus Viridis  
**Local Name:** Porth Glas  
**Type:** River port and market town

**Location:** On the Glaswynn where it emerges from the Lawlands territory, approximately 70 miles upstream from Confluencia.

### Character

Portus Viridis sits at the junction between the scholarly Lawlands and the commercial Rivervales. Historically, it was where ideas met money—where scholars from Lexium's University found investors for their projects, where merchants hired educated factors, where the theoretical and practical shook hands.

The Glaswynn's lazy current made it perfect for leisurely travel. Scholars would book passage on comfortable barges, working on manuscripts while they drifted toward Confluencia and the wider world.

Now the river still runs green with summer algae, but the barges are fewer. Lexium maintains ties—the University Chancellor considers Portus Viridis strategically important—but the traffic is a shadow of what it was.

The town has an odd character: half-empty wine-shops and discussion-halls beside working wharves and warehouses. Faded academic posters alongside cargo manifests. The ghosts of intellectual life haunting a commercial present.

**Pre-Passing Population:** 15,000  
**Post-Passing Population:** ~9,000

### Notable Feature: The Symposium House

A grand building combining lecture hall, library, and tavern—designed for scholars to debate, drink, and occasionally exchange money. The wine cellars are depleted, but the library remains intact. Lady Calpurnia Severa, the current proprietor, has declared it neutral ground: no faction may recruit here, no violence may occur, all are welcome who come in peace.

This neutrality has made it valuable. Quiet negotiations happen here. Information changes hands. Rumor holds that the Lady knows everyone's secrets and sells them selectively.

---

## 4. Bivium — The Two-Roads

### Identity

**Imperial Name:** Bivium  
**Local Name:** Dauffordd ("Two-Paths")  
**Type:** Crossroads market town

**Location:** Where the old Imperial road from the Midlands crosses the Vitawynn below Confluencia, approximately 40 miles downstream.

### Character

Bivium exists at the intersection of river and road. The bridge here is wooden, old, and constantly requiring repair—but it's the only crossing for thirty miles in either direction. The town sprawls on both banks, more sprawl than town, with inns and stables and warehouses arranged around the bridge-approaches.

Before the Passing, it was a transfer point—goods arriving by road could shift to river transport here rather than going all the way to Confluencia. Now the roads are dangerous, but some traffic still moves. Brave or desperate merchants still bring wagons. The bridge still matters.

The town has attracted survivors of every kind. Former farmers whose fields are Reft-haunted. Refugees who got this far and couldn't go farther. A surprising number of entertainment professionals—actors, musicians, prostitutes—who find that people still need distraction even (especially) now.

**Pre-Passing Population:** 8,000  
**Post-Passing Population:** ~5,000

### Notable Feature: The Constant Inn

An enormous coaching inn, more like a small fortress, dominating the western bridge-approach. Run by the Tullius family for six generations. "Constant" because the fires never go out, the doors never close, and the family survives everything.

Grandmother Tullia is the current matriarch—an ancient woman who claims to have survived two plagues before this one. She runs the Constant Inn as a law unto itself. Her house-guards maintain order with ruthless efficiency. Her prices are fair but non-negotiable. Her hospitality extends to anyone who can pay and obey her rules.

The Constant is the closest thing Bivium has to government. When disputes arise, people say "take it to Grandmother." Usually, they do.

# Part Four: Notable Sites

## 1. The Drowned Shrine

### Nature

A pre-Imperial temple to an unknown water deity, now largely submerged in the Arianwynn.

### Location

Approximately 25 miles upstream from Confluencia, where the Arianwynn passes through a marshy section. The river is shallow here but the channel shifts unpredictably.

### History

The shrine predates human settlement—Fae construction, possibly, or something older. When humans arrived, they avoided it. When the Empire came, they attempted to demolish it. The attempt failed. The workers died in accidents. The shrine remained.

Over centuries, the river silted around it. Now only the upper portion is visible—smooth stone pillars rising from the water, carved with symbols no one can read, green with algae that won't scrape off.

### Current State

Local bargemen leave offerings before passing—a splash of wine, a tossed coin, a murmured word. They don't know who they're honoring. They know that boats which don't pay respect... sometimes have accidents.

Since the Passing, the water around the shrine has remained clear when the rest of the river turned muddy. Some call this miraculous. Others note that things are visible in clear water—and some things visible in this water should not be.

**The Hook:** Someone has been leaving elaborate offerings. Not splash-and-go acknowledgments—carefully arranged objects, rare materials, evident ritual. Someone is trying to wake whatever sleeps there.

---

## 2. The Silence of Melder's Ford

### Nature

A stretch of the Glaswynn where no sound carries.

### Location

A shallow ford approximately 50 miles upstream from Confluencia, once used by travelers avoiding tolls. Named for a farmer whose lands bordered it.

### History

During the Passing, something happened at Melder's Ford. The farmer, his family, and everyone within half a mile died. Not from Reft-plague—just stopped. Found where they fell, expressions peaceful, no marks, no cause.

And sound stopped too.

### Current State

The Silence extends about a quarter-mile along the river. Within that zone, sound doesn't travel. You can see your companion's mouth move, but you hear nothing. Your own footsteps are silent. The water flows soundlessly.

Crossing is possible—it's just unsettling. Most people go around.

Those who have crossed report odd experiences: clarity of thought, a sense of being observed without threat, a strange peace. Some have walked in and refused to leave. They sit by the river, mouths moving in soundless conversation with... something.

**The Hook:** A scholar from Lexium believes the Silence is a manifestation of the Null Field—the theoretical emergent phenomenon. They've hired guides to help them study it. They don't understand what they're dealing with.

---

## 3. The Broken Lock

### Nature

An Imperial engineering marvel, catastrophically failed.

### Location

On the Vitawynn, approximately 30 miles downstream from Confluencia. This was the first of a series of locks that once allowed barge traffic to navigate to the Grainmarch regardless of water level.

### History

The Vitawynn drops significantly between Confluencia and Grannaria. Imperial engineers built a series of locks—chambers that could raise or lower water level, allowing boats to "step" down the river. It was an extraordinary achievement, maintained by a dedicated corps of lock-keepers.

During the Passing, something happened to the first lock. The mechanisms jammed, then released catastrophically. The resulting flood destroyed everything downstream for miles. Grannaria itself might have been threatened if the subsequent locks hadn't absorbed the energy.

The lock-keeper corps was devastated. Without maintenance, the remaining locks are failing one by one.

### Current State

The Broken Lock is a ruin—shattered stone chambers, twisted bronze gates, the skeleton of Imperial engineering. The river flows freely through the gap, uncontrolled, uncontrollable.

Below the ruin, the Vitawynn is newly wild. Water levels fluctuate unpredictably. Sandbars form and shift. Navigation is hazardous where it was once safe.

Some say the lock didn't just break—it was *broken*, deliberately, by someone who understood the system intimately. The lock-keeper assigned to that section has never been found.

**The Hook:** The Barge-Masters' Guild in Confluencia is desperate to restore river navigation. They're offering substantial rewards for anyone who can help repair even one lock—or explain what actually happened to this one.

---

## 4. The Silt-Giant

### Nature

A colossal humanoid form composed of river sediment.

### Location

In the marshy delta below the confluence, where the Vitawynn first begins to deposit its burden of silt.

### History

During the Passing, when the eldritch things moved through reality, something happened in the marshes. The silt... rose. Shaped itself. Formed a figure approximately forty feet tall, vaguely humanoid, standing knee-deep in the delta.

It has not moved since. It has not crumbled. Rain and flood should have dissolved it. It remains.

### Current State

The Silt-Giant stands where it formed, facing upriver toward Confluencia. Its features are indistinct—suggestions of eyes, a mouth, arms at its sides. Birds nest in its shoulders. Plants grow from its surface.

Nobody knows what it is. Alysian tradition holds it's a land-spirit awakened by the Passing. Ostaran priests say it's the ghost of the drowned marshes given form. The Flame-Keepers call it an abomination to be destroyed (but haven't tried).

Local bargemen navigate around it carefully. Some swear its head has shifted, tracking their passage. Others dismiss this as imagination.

The delta communities have developed a small cult. They bring offerings—flowers, fish, shiny stones. They ask for protection. They don't know if anyone is listening.

**The Hook:** The Silt-Giant has moved. Only a few inches. Only once. But it definitely moved. Its head turned toward the sea. What is it looking at?

---

# Part Five: Key Figures

## 1. Guildmaster Helena Varus

### Role

Leader of the Barge-Masters' Guild, de facto ruler of Confluencia's working districts.

### Character

Fifty-three years old, stocky, weathered, with rope-calloused hands and a bargeman's instinct for reading currents—both watery and political. Helena grew up on the barges, rose through the Guild ranks, and took leadership two years before the Passing when her predecessor drowned (accident, murder, or suicide—nobody knows; she doesn't discuss it).

She's pragmatic to the point of coldness. The Guild survives; therefore, Confluencia survives; therefore, what keeps the Guild strong is right. This logic has led her to uncomfortable alliances and harder decisions. She has made enemies. She doesn't sleep well.

### Goal

Restore river trade. Not to pre-Passing levels—she's not a fool—but enough to support the remaining population. This requires functional locks downstream (engineering challenge), reliable supplies upstream (political challenge), and peace in Confluencia (social challenge).

### Complication

Helena is dying. Something in her lungs—the Dye-Works' toxic legacy, probably, from years spent on the Clarawynn. She has perhaps two years, maybe less. She needs to secure the Guild's future before she goes, but her preferred successor was killed in a warehouse fire (definitely murder), and the remaining candidates are either incompetent or ambitious in dangerous ways.

She's looking for someone outside the Guild's existing power structure. Someone capable but controllable. Someone who owes her.

---

## 2. Paterfamilias Cassian Catullus

### Role

Head of the Catullus trading house, leader of the Merchant Consortium.

### Character

Sixty-one years old, thin, elegant, with the refined manners of old money and the ruthless instincts of a survivor. The Catullus family has traded in the Rivervales for twelve generations. Cassian grew up learning that commerce is war by other means.

He's not cruel—cruelty is inefficient. He's not kind—kindness is a vulnerability. He's calculating, patient, and utterly devoted to his family's survival. He has fourteen living relatives inside the Catullus compound; he would sacrifice any number of outsiders to protect them.

Since the Passing, he's pulled the South Bank trading houses into alliance through a combination of marriages, loans, and implicit threats. The Consortium is his creation—and his trap. He needs it to survive, but it's filled with ambitious people who would love to replace him.

### Goal

Control Confluencia's grain supply. Whoever controls food controls everything. Helena Varus controls the transport; the Flame-Keepers control public sentiment; but Cassian wants to control what's actually being transported. He's been quietly buying storage rights, hoarding reserves, and positioning for a moment of maximum leverage.

### Complication

His granddaughter Lucia has joined the Flame-Keepers. Not as a spy—genuinely, devotedly joined. She believes the Passing was divine punishment and the family's mercantile values are sinful. Cassian loves her. He also knows she's feeding information to his enemies. He cannot bring himself to act against her, and his inaction is eroding his position.

---

## 3. Father Brennius of the Flowing Light

### Role

Senior priest at the Cathedral, leader of the Flame-Keepers faction.

### Character

Forty-five years old, tall, gaunt, with the burning eyes of a true believer. Brennius was a minor priest before the Passing—competent, unremarkable, destined for a comfortable obscurity. The catastrophe changed him.

He saw the Passing firsthand. He was administering last rites on a barge when the sky tore open. He should have died; others around him did. He didn't. He emerged with absolute conviction: he was spared for a purpose. He would purify Confluencia.

His theology is extreme but internally consistent. The Passing was judgment for sin. Survival indicates potential for redemption. Suffering purifies. The old Church was corrupt; true faith requires fire—literal and metaphorical. He's not stupid; he's something more dangerous: intelligent, devoted, and certain he's right.

### Goal

Make Confluencia holy. Drive out the faithless (which includes most merchants, the Guild, anyone practicing "pagan" traditions). Establish proper worship. Prepare for "the Second Passing" he believes is coming.

### Complication

Brennius is not with the official Scouring movement, and he knows the Scouring's brutality alienates potential converts. He wants purity but he also wants *effectiveness*. This creates tension with his more extreme followers, who want blood now. He's walking a line between inspiring faith and losing control of his own movement.

There's also the matter of his visions. He has them—frequent, vivid, detailed. They guide his decisions. They've been accurate enough to cement his authority. But lately, the visions have been... different. Darker. Showing him things he doesn't want to see. He's beginning to wonder if what speaks to him is actually what he thought it was.

# Part Six: Local Conditions

## The Reft Situation

### Density

Moderate within settlements; severe in rural areas and abandoned districts.

### Predominant Types

| Type | Prevalence | Notes |
|------|------------|-------|
| **Drowned Reft** | High | Natural given the waterways; often found in marshy areas, along riverbanks, in flooded basements |
| **Root Reft** | Moderate | In the overgrown areas where vegetation has reclaimed abandoned structures |
| **Shadow Reft** | Moderate | In the half-abandoned warehouse districts; ambush predators |
| **Burning Reft** | Low | Associated with the Flame-Keepers' territory, disturbingly |

### Concentration

The worst areas are:
- **The Dye-Works** (North Bank, Confluencia): Abandoned industrial district; Drowned Reft congregate in the flooded vats
- **The River Road** (along the Arianwynn): Overland route, now nearly impassable; mixed Reft types
- **Melder's Ford area** (the Silence): Those who entered the Silence and didn't leave became... something. Not quite Reft. Worse.

### Defense

Each settlement has its own approach:
- **Confluencia:** Each quarter handles its own defense; the South Bank is walled; other areas rely on patrols and vigilance
- **Pons Altus:** Commander Petronius's zero-tolerance policy; brutal but effective
- **Molendinum:** Mill-wheels running at night create noise that seems to deter some Reft; night-shifts maintain them specifically for this purpose
- **Bivium:** Grandmother Tullia's guards; town huddles around the Constant Inn for protection

---

## Travel

### By Water

Still the safest method. The rivers flow; boats still run (though fewer). The Barge-Masters' Guild controls traffic and provides what passes for security.

**Challenges:**
- Lock system failing: Travel downstream toward Grannaria is increasingly hazardous
- Tolls at Pons Altus are extortionate
- Drowned Reft can emerge from the water, particularly in slow-moving stretches

### By Road

Dangerous. The old Imperial roads exist but are unmaintained and haunted.

| Route | Condition | Risk |
|-------|-----------|------|
| **River Road (along Arianwynn)** | Overgrown, bridges failing | Very High |
| **Via Fluvialis (main east-west)** | Patrolled near towns, wild between | High |
| **Local tracks** | Variable | Moderate to Severe |

### Practical Reality

Most people don't travel. Those who must travel take boats. Those who can't afford boats form groups, hire guards, and pray.

---

## Trade

### What Flows In (Barely)

- **Grain** from the Grainmarch (controlled, rationed, expensive)
- **Manufactured goods** from the Crown Lands (luxury items that nobody can afford)
- **Fish** from local rivers (the one reliable food source)
- **Timber** from upstream forests (in demand for repairs and coffins)

### What Flows Out (Barely)

- **Dyed cloth** from the Dye-Works (production collapsed; existing inventory still valuable)
- **Milled goods** from Molendinum (flour, paper, lumber)
- **River services** (piloting, transport, repair)

### Who Controls It

The Barge-Masters' Guild controls transport, which gives them leverage over everything. The Merchant Consortium has capital but nothing to spend it on. Father Brennius periodically calls for "fair distribution" which everyone interprets as "seize merchant property."

---

## Religion

### Official Position

Solarian Church, administered from the Cathedral of the Flowing Light.

### Actual Practice

| Tradition | Status | Location |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| **Solarian Orthodox** | Dominant in theory; fractured | Cathedral, Delta quarter |
| **Flame-Keeper Movement** | Growing rapidly | Cathedral, spreading to other quarters |
| **Alysian Folk Practice** | Reviving openly | Rural areas, the Silt-Giant cult |
| **Atargatan Elements** | Never suppressed, given the rivers | Bargemen, waterfront communities |
| **Ostaran Veneration** | Quiet but persistent | The Quiethouse on South Bank |

### The Cathedral's Problem

The Flame-Keepers control the Cathedral but don't represent mainstream faith. Many citizens resent their extremism but have nowhere else to go. A moderate alternative could split the movement—but who would lead it?

---

## The Scars

The Passing left specific wounds:

### The Silence of Melder's Ford
Described above. A Null Field manifestation, probably—where meaning itself was damaged.

### The Wrong Waters
For weeks after the Passing, the rivers ran *backward*. This should be impossible. It happened. The current eventually returned to normal, but some stretches of water remain... odd. The Drowned Shrine's clear water. A bend in the Glaswynn where reflections don't match what's above them.

### The Memorial Stones
Throughout the Vales, people died where they stood during certain moments of the Passing. Some have left marks—outlines in stone, as if their shadows were burned into the ground. These "Memorial Stones" are treated with uneasy reverence. Some families bring flowers. Others avoid them entirely.

---

# Part Seven: Adventure Hooks

## 1. The Lock-Keeper's Legacy

**Setup:** The Broken Lock didn't fail—it was sabotaged. The lock-keeper who did it left notes, hidden somewhere, explaining why. The notes also contain technical information essential for restoring the remaining locks.

**Complication:** The lock-keeper's family still lives in Confluencia. They know something but they're not talking. Someone else is looking for the notes—someone willing to kill for them.

**Stakes:** If the locks fail completely, river transport below Confluencia becomes impossible. The city starves.

## 2. The Silt-Giant Wakes

**Setup:** The Silt-Giant has definitely moved. It's taken three steps toward Confluencia. At this rate, it will reach the city in six months. Nobody knows what will happen when it arrives.

**Complication:** The delta cult believes it's coming to save them. The Flame-Keepers believe it's a demon to be destroyed. The Guild just wants it stopped before it blocks river traffic.

**Stakes:** Is the Silt-Giant threat, salvation, or something beyond either category? The answer might determine Confluencia's fate.

## 3. The Quiethouse Secret

**Setup:** Lady Calpurnia Severa of the Symposium House and the Ostaran priests at the Quiethouse are working together on something—late-night meetings, unusual shipments, hired guards for something. Father Brennius suspects heresy.

**Complication:** They're actually preparing a refuge—a plan to evacuate civilians if violence erupts. But the preparations look suspicious, and investigating them risks exposing the plan to those who would sabotage it.

**Stakes:** If the Flame-Keepers discover and destroy the refuge plan, many innocents will have no escape when the inevitable conflict comes.

## 4. The Drowned Shrine Awakens

**Setup:** Someone is conducting rituals at the Drowned Shrine—serious rituals, with genuine power. The bargemen are frightened. The water around the shrine has begun to *glow*.

**Complication:** The ritualist is Lucia Catullus, Cassian's granddaughter, the Flame-Keeper convert. Except she's not practicing Church ritual. She's found something older, and it's answering.

**Stakes:** What sleeps in the Drowned Shrine? Is Lucia summoning it, feeding it, or becoming it? Her grandfather will pay anything for answers—but can he afford the truth?

## 5. The Price of Passage

**Setup:** Commander Petronius at Pons Altus is demanding impossible tolls. Trade is strangling. Someone needs to do something.

**Complication:** Petronius can't be bribed—he has principles, of a sort. He can't easily be assassinated—he's paranoid and competent. And his zero-tolerance Reft policy means that removing him might doom Pons Altus to the same fate as other towns.

**Stakes:** Find another solution. Negotiate, threaten, find leverage, discover a secret—something that changes the equation without destroying what Petronius has built.
