# Part One: The Capital City

## Zircon — The Jewel City

### Names and Titles

| Form | Name | Meaning |
|------|------|---------|
| **Imperial** | Zircon | From the gem |
| **Local** | Ratnanagara | "Gem-City" |
| **Formal** | Urbs Gemmarum | "City of Gems" |
| **Epithet** | The White Crown | For its whitewashed terraces visible from the delta |

### Location and Geography

Zircon is built into a south-facing hillside overlooking the great Vitaflum delta. The city rises in dramatic terraces from the piedmont zone at 800 feet to the acropolis at 2,200 feet elevation. Three seasonal streams—the Maniflumen (Ruby Stream), the Nilaflumen (Sapphire Stream), and the Viridflumen (Emerald Stream)—cascade down through the city in channels lined with colored stone, their waters tinted by mineral runoff from the mines above.

The city commands the primary pass between the delta lowlands and the gem-rich hills beyond. Caravans ascending from Khaldera must pass through Zircon's gates; caravans descending from the Dragon-kin territories must do the same. This position made Zircon wealthy long before the Empire arrived.

**The Terrace System:**
The city is organized into seven major terraces, each approximately 200 feet higher than the one below. Connecting them are the famous **Stairways of Light**—broad white marble steps set with gem fragments that catch the sun. Visitors describe ascending Zircon as "climbing a ladder of rainbows."

### Scale

| Period | Population | Notes |
|--------|------------|-------|
| **Pre-Passing** | 35,000 | Thriving gem trade, wealthy summer visitors |
| **Post-Passing** | ~25,000 | Crystal-tech boom offsetting trade collapse |

The population loss was less severe than in many Imperial cities. The Jewel Hills' isolation and elevation provided some protection, and the pivot to crystal-tech research has attracted new residents—including a significant influx of Kobalthari advisors and Tiān-Phanes scholars.

### The Seven Terraces

#### First Terrace: The Arrivals (Adventus)

The lowest terrace, where the road from Khaldera enters through the **Gate of the Setting Sun**—so named because travelers ascending from the blazing delta enter into the cooler shadow of the hills.

**Character:** Caravanserai, warehouses, assessment offices, temporary housing. The smell of pack animals and sweat. Workers sorting rough stones. The noise of commerce.

**Notable Features:**
- **The Weigh House** — Where gems are assessed for tariff. Pre-Passing, this was one of the Empire's most important customs posts.
- **The Caravanserai of Seven Stars** — The largest inn-complex, built around a courtyard with a fountain in each corner representing the seven terraces. Now half-empty.
- **The Teamsters' Shrine** — A small Tapassan chapel where cart-drivers bask in the morning sun before beginning the long descent.

#### Second Terrace: The Workshops (Officinae)

Where raw stones become finished gems. The cutting, polishing, and setting districts.

**Character:** Constant sound of cutting wheels. Fine dust in the air. Craftsmen bent over their work. The gleam of gems at every stage of transformation.

**Notable Features:**
- **The Gem-Cutters' Guildhall** — A fortress-like structure where the guild maintains its secrets. The great cutting wheels are inside, powered by water from the streams.
- **The Street of Small Fortunes** — Where lesser gem-cutters work in open-front shops. Once packed with artisans; now many shops stand empty.
- **The Crystal-Tech Workshops** — New additions since the Passing. Experimental facilities where Kobalthari and human researchers attempt to replicate Tyrlóng's crystal technology.

#### Third Terrace: The Markets (Mercatura)

The commercial heart of Zircon. Where finished gems are sold, where merchants negotiate, where fortunes change hands.

**Character:** Covered arcades protecting precious goods from sun and rain. Hushed negotiations. Private viewing rooms. Armed guards at every corner.

**Notable Features:**
- **The Arcade of Colors** — The main gem market, a covered street where each section specializes in a different stone. Rubies at the east end, sapphires at the west, emeralds in the middle.
- **The Counting House of Aurelius** — The oldest banking house, established before Imperial conquest. Still operates, though its vaults are less full.
- **The Factor's Quarter** — Where representatives of distant powers maintain offices. The Dragon-kin factor's house is the largest; the Tyrlóng factor's is the most heavily guarded.

#### Fourth Terrace: The Residences (Habitationes)

The primary residential district for Zircon's permanent population.

**Character:** Whitewashed houses with gem-inlaid doorframes (a tradition declaring the household's trade or patron stone). Narrow streets providing shade. Neighborhood fountains where residents gather.

**Notable Features:**
- **The Street of Master Cutters** — Where the guild's senior craftsmen maintain their households. Each doorframe displays the master's signature cut.
- **The Tiān-Phanes Quarter** — A recent development where Dragon-kin scholars have established residences. Their buildings incorporate distinctive curved roofs and fire-vents.
- **The Shrine of the Received Sun** — A Tapassan community temple where the cold-blooded kin gather to bask on heated stones.

#### Fifth Terrace: The Villas (Villae)

Summer estates of delta aristocracy and wealthy gem merchants.

**Character:** Larger properties with gardens, private courtyards, commanding views of the delta below. Many now empty or converted to other uses.

**Notable Features:**
- **The Sunset Villas** — A row of aristocratic summer homes on the western edge, famous for their views. Several now house refugees from Khaldera.
- **The Artificer's Manor** — Formerly a merchant prince's estate, now converted to a crystal-tech research facility under Kobalthari direction.
- **The Healing Gardens** — A villa converted to hospice use, where those suffering lingering effects of the Passing are cared for. Run by a quiet order of Ostaran-aligned healers.

#### Sixth Terrace: The Temples (Sacra)

The religious district, though "religious" in Zircon has always been a complicated term.

**Character:** Temple facades competing for attention. The smell of incense. Priests of various traditions passing each other with varying degrees of politeness.

**Notable Features:**
- **The Cathedral of St. Aurelius the Illuminator** — The official Solarian church, built on the site of an older Tapassan sun-temple. The conversion was never entirely successful; the architecture still speaks of basking.
- **The Hidden Temple** — An open secret: a shrine to the Theosyn goddess Eroswen (desire, beauty) maintained behind the facade of a "meditation house." The gem trade always generated prayers to the goddess of beautiful things.
- **The Kobalthari Reading Chamber** — Not technically a temple, but functions as one. A place where Kobalthari read the patterns in crystal and ore, seeking guidance.

#### Seventh Terrace: The Acropolis (Arx)

The heights. Administrative center, military garrison, and the homes of the truly powerful.

**Character:** Cool breezes, commanding views, an atmosphere of power and paranoia. Walls within walls.

**Notable Features:**
- **The Governor's Palace** — A sprawling complex built around the ancient citadel. Currently occupied by the Prefect, though her authority is increasingly contested.
- **The Garrison** — Imperial troops once; now a mix of mercenaries and local militia. Loyalty unclear.
- **The Crystal Observatory** — A new addition: a tower equipped with crystal lenses for studying the realm-fields. The Tiān-Phanes consider it crude but promising.

### Atmosphere

Zircon smells of dust—mineral dust from the cutting workshops, carried on the warm updrafts from the delta below. The light is extraordinary: at certain hours, the gem-inlaid buildings catch the sun and scatter rainbows across the white walls. The sound is the hiss of cutting wheels, the splash of water in fountains, and the constant negotiation—everything in Zircon is for sale, everything has a price, and the price is always negotiable.

The heat of the delta doesn't quite reach here, but the sun is fierce. Awnings cover most streets. Siesta is observed strictly. The city wakes at dawn, sleeps through midday, and comes alive again in the evening, when the gem markets conduct their most important business by lamplight that makes the stones glow.

Since the Passing, there's a new undertone: the hum of crystal-tech experiments, the excited chatter of scholars discussing applications, the occasional flash of a new discovery being tested. Zircon has always transformed raw material into something precious. Now it's trying to transform gems into something more—power, protection, survival.

### Who Rules

**The Prefect: Lady Cornelia Aurata**

Technically, Zircon is administered by an Imperial Prefect appointed by the Governor at Khaldera. Lady Cornelia Aurata has held the position for twelve years—appointed before the Passing, surviving through it, now navigating a world where Imperial authority means little.

She is a pragmatist. When Dragon-kin advisors began arriving, she welcomed them. When Kobalthari researchers requested facilities, she provided them. When the Gem-Cutters' Guild demanded more autonomy, she negotiated rather than commanded. When refugees from Khaldera appeared, she found space.

Her actual power depends on maintaining the balance between factions: the traditional gem trade (declining), the crystal-tech research (rising), the Kobalthari influence (growing), and the remnants of Imperial authority (fading). She is good at this balance. She is not certain how long it can last.

**The Gem-Cutters' Guild**

The Guild controls access to the cutting workshops and, by extension, to the finished gem trade. Pre-Passing, they were powerful but subordinate to Imperial authority. Now they're one of three legs on which Zircon's stability rests.

Guild Master Severus Crystallus is old, cautious, and suspicious of the crystal-tech newcomers. He sees them as potential rivals—people who want gems for power rather than beauty. He's not entirely wrong.

**The Kobalthari Advisor Council**

The blue-skinned interpreters from the mountain deeps have established a quiet but significant presence. They came initially to advise on the crystal-tech research—their expertise in reading power-patterns in stone is unmatched. They've stayed because they sense something important happening here.

Their nominal leader is **Sage Azuris the Pattern-Reader**, though Kobalthari don't really have leaders in the human sense. She speaks for them, interprets their consensus, and maintains relations with the Prefect.

### The Tensions

**Traditional Trade vs. Crystal-Tech**

The old gem merchants made their fortunes selling beauty. The new researchers want to sell power. These goals aren't entirely compatible. A ruby that might sell for a small fortune as jewelry might be more valuable ground into crystal-tech components—but grinding it destroys the beauty the traditional trade prizes.

Some craftsmen have adapted, learning to cut stones for magical properties rather than aesthetic ones. Others resist, seeing crystal-tech as a corruption of their art.

**Imperial Authority vs. Local Autonomy**

Lady Cornelia technically represents the Empire. But what Empire? Khaldera's authority is fragmenting. The Governor there has enough problems without worrying about the Jewel Hills. The Prefect's legitimacy depends on Imperial authority that barely exists.

Some factions want to declare outright independence. Others fear that without even nominal Imperial protection, the Dragon-kin might simply absorb the region into their territories.

**Human vs. Dragon-kin Influence**

The Kobalthari are helpful. The Tiān-Phanes scholars are brilliant. But they're not human. Their presence raises uncomfortable questions. Is Zircon becoming a human city with Dragon-kin advisors, or a Dragon-kin outpost with human workers?

The Dragon-kin themselves seem content to advise rather than rule. But the Consilium Draconis is watching, and no one knows what they're planning.

# Part Two: Secondary Settlements

## 2.1 Rubrum — The Ruby Town

### Names

| Form | Name |
|------|------|
| **Imperial** | Rubrum |
| **Local** | Padmarāganagara ("Ruby-Town") |
| **Common** | Red Hill |

### Location and Type

A mining town 45 miles northeast of Zircon, situated where the richest ruby deposits emerge from the hills. The town occupies a narrow valley between two ridge lines, with the mines tunneling into the eastern ridge and the processing facilities in the valley floor.

### Population

| Period | Population |
|--------|------------|
| **Pre-Passing** | 8,000 |
| **Post-Passing** | ~5,500 |

### Character

Rubrum is a working town with no pretensions. The buildings are practical stone and timber, stained red by the dust that gets into everything. The rhythm of life follows the mining shifts: the morning crews descending, the night crews emerging, the constant rumble of ore carts.

The town's mood has shifted since the Passing. Ruby mining continues—the stones are valuable for crystal-tech as well as jewelry—but there's a defensive quality now. The mines go deep, and deep mines connect to... other places. The mining guild has sealed several tunnels that "went wrong," and no one talks about what was found there.

### Notable Feature: The Blood Seam

Three years before the Passing, miners broke into a vein of rubies so rich they called it the Blood Seam. The stones were extraordinary—deep red, internally flawless, larger than any found before.

Then miners started dying. Not in accidents—just dying. Found in the morning, cold in their beds, with expressions of perfect peace. The Blood Seam was sealed. Anyone who'd worked it directly was quietly retired with generous pensions. The stones already extracted were... disposed of.

Since the Passing, the sealed tunnel has started bleeding. Red liquid seeps through the barriers—not blood exactly, but something that looks like it. The Mining Guild Master claims it's mineral-rich water. No one believes her. The Church wanted to investigate; they were politely but firmly refused access.

**The Kobalthari Opinion:** The Pattern-Readers examined the seepage from a safe distance. Their assessment: "The mountain remembers being wounded. This is not malice. This is grief." They recommended leaving it alone.

## 2.2 Prasinum — The Emerald Deep

### Names

| Form | Name |
|------|------|
| **Imperial** | Prasinum |
| **Local** | Marakatagarba ("Emerald-Womb") |
| **Common** | Greendeep |

### Location and Type

A fortress-mine complex 70 miles west of Zircon, where emerald deposits run in narrow veins through particularly hard stone. Unlike the ruby mines' horizontal tunnels, the emerald workings go straight down—shaft after shaft descending into darkness.

### Population

| Period | Population |
|--------|------------|
| **Pre-Passing** | 6,000 |
| **Post-Passing** | ~4,000 |

### Character

Prasinum exists in permanent twilight. The valley is narrow enough that direct sunlight reaches the floor for only a few hours each day. The miners work by lamplight more often than not. The emeralds they extract are famous for their depth of color—a green so pure it seems to glow from within.

The town is vertically organized: wealthy merchants and administrators on the sunlit ridge tops, workers in the shadowed valley, and the mines going down, down, down below everything. The class divisions are literal here.

Since the Passing, Prasinum has become strange. Not dangerous exactly—but strange. People report vivid dreams. Some claim to see figures in the peripheral vision that vanish when looked at directly. The deepest shafts have been sealed, not because of specific threats but because workers refused to descend past certain points. They say the darkness down there is "too thick."

### Notable Feature: The Verdant Oracle

At the lowest point of the oldest shaft—sealed for over a century—is a chamber called the Verdant Oracle. According to records, early miners broke into a natural cave filled with emerald formations. In the center stood a perfect crystal spire, taller than a man, that seemed to *respond* to questions.

The Empire sealed it during consolidation. The Church declared it demonic. But the records suggest the Oracle never gave harmful advice—just advice that disturbed those who received it. One miner asked if his son would survive a fever. The Oracle reportedly said, "He will survive the fever. You will not survive his survival." The son recovered and became a Flagellant who beat his father to death during a zealous episode.

The Tiān-Phanes have petitioned for access. They believe the Verdant Oracle might be a naturally-formed crystal-tech artifact—proof that the principles they're developing were discovered by the earth itself. The Prefect has not decided whether to allow it.

## 2.3 Adamantum — The Hard Place

### Names

| Form | Name |
|------|------|
| **Imperial** | Adamantum |
| **Local** | Vajrakshetra ("Diamond-Field") |
| **Common** | The Hard Place |

### Location and Type

A fortified mining settlement 60 miles south of Zircon, where diamonds are extracted from an ancient volcanic pipe. The pipe itself is the remains of a long-dead volcano, its core now a cylinder of diamond-bearing stone called **kimberlite**.

### Population

| Period | Population |
|--------|------------|
| **Pre-Passing** | 4,500 |
| **Post-Passing** | ~3,800 |

### Character

Adamantum is the most militarized of the mining towns. Diamonds are too valuable to leave unguarded, and the mine's unique geology—a single deep pit rather than dispersed tunnels—makes it a natural fortress. Walls surround the pit; guards watch every wagon; workers are searched entering and leaving.

The town that serves the mine is practical and paranoid. Everyone knows everyone. Strangers are noticed immediately. The miners form a closed community, intermarrying, keeping secrets, maintaining traditions that predate Imperial rule.

Unlike the other mining towns, Adamantum was barely touched by the Passing. The Reft came—but they couldn't enter the diamond pit. Something about the geometry of the place, or the nature of the stones, or the wards the miners have maintained for generations. The Kobalthari studied the phenomenon and concluded: "Diamonds remember pressure. They remember being formed. Nothing false can survive that memory."

### Notable Feature: The Pressure Temple

At the bottom of the diamond pit, the miners maintain what they call the Pressure Temple—a shrine to Gwenaelle (Peaks) that acknowledges both the Axis Faith of the northern dwarves and the Tapassan traditions of the south. The theology is heterodox: they worship pressure as sacred, the force that transforms carbon into diamond, the suffering that creates beauty.

The temple contains the **Heart of Adamantum**—a diamond the size of a man's head, uncut, still embedded in its matrix of kimberlite. The miners believe that cutting it would end the protection that keeps the pit safe. Crystal-tech researchers have suggested it might be a natural power-focus. The miners have made clear that anyone attempting to study it will find out what the bottom of the pit looks like from very close range.

---

## 2.4 Auricollis — The Golden Height

### Names

| Form | Name |
|------|------|
| **Imperial** | Auricollis |
| **Local** | Suvarnashikhara ("Gold-Peak") |
| **Common** | Goldtop |

### Location and Type

A wealthy market town 50 miles northwest of Zircon, situated at the highest navigable point on the hill road toward Dragon-kin territory. Not a mining town itself, but the transshipment point where southern gold meets northern gems.

### Population

| Period | Population |
|--------|------------|
| **Pre-Passing** | 12,000 |
| **Post-Passing** | ~7,000 |

### Character

Auricollis has always been about connections. Dragon-kin caravans descend from the north, human caravans ascend from the south, and everything changes hands in Auricollis's famous markets. The town grew wealthy as a neutral ground—a place where human and Dragon-kin merchants could negotiate without the complications of entering each other's territories.

The architecture reflects this dual identity: human buildings with Dragon-kin decorative elements, Dragon-kin-designed storehouses built by human labor, and the famous **Golden Bridge**—a span across the gorge that marks the traditional boundary, decorated with gold leaf paid for jointly by both peoples.

Since the Passing, Auricollis has struggled. Trade is reduced. The Dragon-kin come less frequently. The human caravans from Khaldera have nearly stopped. But the town survives because it's still the best place for the two peoples to meet, and meeting is still necessary.

### Notable Feature: The Hall of Fair Dealing

In the center of Auricollis stands the Hall of Fair Dealing—a market building constructed jointly by human and Dragon-kin architects before the Empire existed. The Hall is neutral ground in the most absolute sense. Violence within its walls is punishable by both human and Dragon-kin law, simultaneously and without appeal.

The Hall contains the **Golden Scales**—a set of balance scales made from Dragon-forged gold that are said to weigh not just material but *intent*. Deals made on the Golden Scales cannot be broken without consequence. What consequence? The stories vary. Disease. Misfortune. The death of things the oathbreaker loves. No one has tested it in living memory.

The Hall is now the site of delicate negotiations. The Dragon-kin want something from the Jewel Hills—probably the crystal-tech research. The humans want assurances of protection. Neither side trusts the other enough to speak plainly. The Hall of Fair Dealing may be the only place where trust can be built.

# Part Three: Notable Sites

## 3.1 The Sleeping Mines (Fodinae Dormientes)

### Location and Type

A complex of abandoned mines in the hills 30 miles east of Zircon, sealed for over three centuries. The mines predate Imperial rule—possibly predate human settlement in the region.

### History

The Sleeping Mines were ancient when humans first arrived in the Jewel Hills. Early settlers found the tunnel entrances already carved, the shafts already dug, the veins already partially extracted. Who had mined here? The style suggested neither human nor Dragon-kin work. The tunnels were too regular for natural formation, too organic for dwarven precision.

The settlers extracted considerable wealth before discovering why the mines had been abandoned. Deep in the primary shaft, they found the Sleepers—enormous figures carved from stone, or perhaps *growing* from stone, resting in niches carved into the walls. The figures seemed to be sleeping. Their faces were almost human. Their proportions were wrong.

Nothing happened immediately. But over the following years, miners in the Sleeping Mines began having identical dreams—dreams of waking up, of stretching limbs that had been still too long, of hunger after ages of sleep. The miners sealed the deep shafts. Then they sealed the upper shafts. Then they sealed the entrances entirely.

### Current State

The seals held for three centuries. Then the Passing came, and something shifted. The seals are intact—but sounds emerge from behind them. Scraping sounds. Movement sounds. Not frequent. Not loud. But present.

The local population avoids the area. The Prefect has posted guards—not to prevent something from getting out (they wouldn't be able to), but to monitor whether the sounds are getting louder.

### The Hook

The Kobalthari believe the Sleeping Mines might contain artifacts from before the God-Giant War—possibly Giant-made, possibly older still. The potential value is incalculable. The potential danger is also incalculable. Someone will eventually attempt to investigate. The question is whether they'll do so wisely or foolishly.

---

## 3.2 The Sunbask Plateau (Planities Solaris)

### Location and Type

A broad plateau 25 miles south of Zircon, at the highest elevation in the Jewel Hills accessible by road. Sacred to the Tapassan tradition—one of the holiest sun-basking sites in the Empire.

### History

The Sunbask Plateau receives more direct sunlight than anywhere else in the region. The air is thin enough that the sun's heat penetrates more intensely. For the cold-blooded Tapassan kin—lizard-folk, croc-kin, and their smaller cousins—this is paradise.

Before Imperial rule, the plateau was maintained as a shared sacred space. Multiple Tapassan communities made pilgrimages here, basking together during the summer solstice, renewing their connection to the Received Sun. The Empire tolerated the practice as "native superstition," and the Church attempted conversion with limited success.

### Current State

Since the Passing, the Sunbask Plateau has become a refuge. Tapassan communities from the delta, displaced by chaos and Reft, have gathered here in unprecedented numbers. The summer solstice gathering that once drew hundreds now draws thousands.

The community is organizing. What was a religious gathering is becoming a permanent settlement—the first majority-Tapassan town in the Jewel Hills. They call it **Tapaspur** ("City of Warmth"). They're building heated stone structures for winter survival. They're establishing farms on the plateau's edges. They're creating something new.

The Prefect is uncertain how to respond. The Tapassan aren't hostile—they've actually been helpful, their scouts reporting Reft movements, their warriors defending caravan routes. But their presence changes the demographic balance of the region, and some human settlements are uncomfortable with thousands of lizard-folk as neighbors.

### The Hook

The Tapassan elders say the Sunbask Plateau was sacred long before their people arrived. They speak of the **Sun-Scar**—a mark on the plateau's stone that appeared "when the sun touched the earth." They believe it's a gateway, though to where they won't say. The mark is real: a vitrified circle, 100 feet across, where stone has been fused into glass by impossible heat. Something happened here. Something might happen again.

---

## 3.3 The Cathedral of the Broken Sky (Cathedralis Caeli Fracti)

### Location and Type

A ruined cathedral in the hills 40 miles north of Zircon, destroyed during the Passing. The site has become a place of dark pilgrimage.

### History

The Cathedral of the Broken Sky was built five centuries ago at the highest point reachable from the northern road. The name referred to its famous ceiling: a dome painted to represent the heavens, with crystal skylights positioned so that sunlight would strike different parts of the painting at different times of day, creating the illusion that the sky itself was inside the building.

The cathedral was dedicated to the Light—a Solarian structure built to overawe the local population and demonstrate the Church's power. It succeeded. For centuries, it was the most impressive religious building in the Jewel Hills, drawing pilgrims from across the South.

### Current State

During the Passing, something came through. Not the Eldritch creatures themselves—they were too vast to fit—but something trailing behind them, caught in their wake. It entered through the skylights, shattering the crystal, cracking the dome, and leaving destruction in its passage.

The priests and pilgrims present died. Their bodies were found frozen in postures of ecstasy—arms raised, faces upturned, expressions of terrible joy. The Church declared the site desecrated and ordered it sealed.

The seal lasted three years. Then the Flagellants came.

The Flagellant orders see the Cathedral as proof of their doctrine: the sky literally broke, the Church literally failed, and only suffering can atone for whatever sin brought the Passing. They've established a permanent camp among the ruins. They hold their most extreme rituals where the altar once stood.

The Prefect cannot dislodge them—they're too numerous and too willing to die. The Church's official position is that they're heretics. But the Church's official positions carry less weight each year.

### The Hook

The Flagellants aren't the only ones interested in the Cathedral. Something remained after the Passing—a residue, an echo, a *presence*. The Flagellants' suffering seems to feed it. Some of the more extreme practitioners have begun manifesting abilities: healing wounds instantly, seeing through walls, speaking in voices not their own.

The Blood Field is crystallizing here. The Flagellants don't know it—they think they're receiving divine gifts. Someone needs to investigate before the crystallization becomes permanent.

---

## 3.4 The Merchant Prince's Folly (Stultitia Principis)

### Location and Type

A half-completed palace complex 15 miles east of Zircon, abandoned before the Passing, now occupied by refugees and opportunists.

### History

Twenty years before the Passing, the wealthiest gem merchant in Zircon—a man named Aurelius Geminus—decided to build himself a palace that would rival the Governor's. He purchased a hilltop with commanding views, hired architects from Tyrlóng, and began construction on a sprawling complex featuring Crystal-Tech innovations decades ahead of their time.

He ran out of money seven years in. The partially-constructed buildings stood empty for years, slowly deteriorating. Local people called it the Folly and avoided it.

### Current State

The Passing changed everything. Refugees from Khaldera needed somewhere to go. The Folly had walls (some of them), roofs (most of them), and space (plenty of it). People moved in. Then more people. Then people who saw opportunity in the gathering population.

The Folly is now a chaotic semi-settlement of perhaps 3,000 souls. It has no official authority—the Prefect pretends it doesn't exist—but it has *de facto* governance: the **Council of Opportunists**, a shifting coalition of refugee leaders, criminals, merchants too marginal for Zircon's markets, and anyone else who's carved out a niche.

The settlement is dangerous but functional. Markets operate (unregulated). Services exist (informal). Law is kept (by whoever has the most armed followers at any given moment). It's a shadow Zircon—everything the official city won't acknowledge happening in plain sight.

### The Hook

The Tyrlóng architects built crystal-tech systems into the Folly's foundations—heating, lighting, communication systems that were cutting-edge for their time. Most were never activated because the construction was never finished. But the infrastructure is there, buried under cheap additions and refugee shantytowns.

Someone with the right knowledge could activate these systems. The Folly could become the first crystal-tech-enabled city in the Empire—or a disaster waiting to happen, depending on who does the activating and what they actually activate.

# Part Four: Key Figures

## 4.1 Prefect Lady Cornelia Aurata

### Role
Imperial Prefect of the Jewel Hills, nominal governor of the sub-region.

### Character

Lady Cornelia is fifty-two, silver-haired, and possessed of a calculating intelligence that has kept her alive and in power through twelve years of increasing chaos. She was appointed Prefect as a sinecure—a comfortable retirement post for a mid-level administrator. Then the Passing made comfortable retirement impossible.

She has no great vision, no ideological commitment, no burning ambition. What she has is survival instinct refined to an art form. She reads people well, negotiates better, and never commits to a position until she's certain which way the wind is blowing. Her critics call her a weathervane. Her supporters call her adaptable.

She maintains the fiction of Imperial authority because it's useful—it gives her legitimacy without requiring her to actually do anything the Empire would demand. She welcomes the Kobalthari because they're useful—their knowledge gives Zircon advantages. She tolerates the Flagellants because opposing them would cost more than ignoring them.

### Goal

Survival—for herself, for Zircon, for the system that keeps her in power. She has no plans for five years from now. She's focused on getting through the next month.

### Complication

The Consilium Draconis has sent a formal envoy requesting a permanent Dragon-kin presence in Zircon—not just advisors, but administrators. They're offering protection. They're implying that refusing would have consequences. Lady Cornelia must decide whether to accept (and possibly become a Dragon-kin puppet) or refuse (and possibly lose Dragon-kin support entirely).

---

## 4.2 Guild Master Severus Crystallus

### Role
Master of the Gem-Cutters' Guild, de facto ruler of Zircon's traditional economy.

### Character

Severus is seventy years old and looks every day of it. His hands, once the steadiest in the trade, now tremble too much for fine cutting. His eyes, once capable of spotting flaws invisible to others, have dimmed. But his mind remains sharp, and his grip on the Guild remains firm.

He came up through the traditional path: apprentice, journeyman, master, eventually Guild Master. He believes in the old ways—gems cut for beauty, value measured in aesthetics, the craft as an end in itself. The crystal-tech researchers offend him at a deep level. Gems are not *tools*. They're art.

He's fighting a rearguard action against a future he doesn't want. The traditional trade is dying. Young cutters want to learn crystal-tech applications because that's where the money is. The Guild's monopoly on finished gems means nothing when the finished gems sit unsold in warehouses.

### Goal

Preserve the Guild's position. Keep the old ways alive. Prevent Zircon from becoming a manufacturing center for crystal-tech components.

### Complication

His granddaughter, **Lucia Crystallus**, has defected to the crystal-tech researchers. She's brilliant—perhaps the most talented cutter of her generation—and she's convinced that the future lies in magical applications. Severus refuses to speak to her. But she's also his heir, and the Guild is watching to see how he handles the situation.

---

## 4.3 Sage Azuris the Pattern-Reader

### Role
Senior Kobalthari advisor, spokesperson for the Dragon-kin presence in Zircon.

### Character

Azuris is difficult to age—Kobalthari lifespans are long, and she's been reading patterns in stone since before the current Prefect was born. Her skin has the blue-grey tinge of heavy cobalt exposure; her fingers are stained permanently blue. When she looks at you, you get the sense that she's seeing things you'd rather keep hidden.

She speaks carefully, using fewer words than humans expect, each one chosen precisely. She doesn't lie—Kobalthari consider deception a corruption of the pattern—but she's extremely skilled at saying true things that lead listeners to false conclusions.

She came to Zircon because the patterns told her to. Something is happening here, something important, something that will shape the future of the relationship between Dragon-kin and humans. She's here to watch, to advise, and to ensure that whatever happens serves the interests of her people.

### Goal

Understand what's happening with the crystal-tech research and ensure that Dragon-kin benefit from it. Specifically, she wants to determine whether humans have accidentally discovered something the Dragon-kin missed—and if so, whether it can be safely shared or must be controlled.

### Complication

The patterns she reads are becoming unclear. Something is interfering—something from below, from the old mines, from the deep places. The same something that's making the Sleeping Mines stir. She needs to investigate, but doing so would require revealing how much the Kobalthari are paying attention to Zircon's secrets.

# Part Five: Local Conditions

## The Reft Situation

### Overall Assessment

The Jewel Hills are **moderately affected** by the Reft—less than the lowlands, more than the Dragon-kin territories. The elevation and isolation provided some protection. The mining tunnels provided hiding places. The fortified mining towns were easier to defend.

**Reft Density by Area:**

| Area | Density | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| Zircon proper | Very Low | Walls, patrols, organized response |
| Mining towns | Low | Fortified, armed workers, sealed tunnels |
| Hill roads | Moderate | Caravan routes cleared regularly |
| Abandoned mines | High | Concentrated in sealed areas |
| Wilderness | Moderate | Scattered, territorial |

### Predominant Types

**Root Reft** are most common in the hills—territorial beings bound to specific locations, often found in and around abandoned mine shafts. They don't pursue prey but will attack anything that enters their territory. Mining communities have learned to recognize the boundaries.

**Bone Reft** are present near the Cathedral of the Broken Sky and other sites of mass death. They're drawn to grief and dying—not ideal in a region where mining accidents still happen regularly.

**Storm Reft** occasionally descend from the heights during lightning seasons. They're rare but dangerous—the elevation and exposed terrain make them more likely to encounter travelers.

### Local Responses

The mining towns have developed a system of **Tunnel Wardens**—specialized fighters who clear Reft from mine workings. The profession is dangerous, well-compensated, and respected. Most Wardens don't survive more than a few years.

Zircon maintains a **Bright Company**—Light-field practitioners (nominally Solarian, practically eclectic) who can destroy Reft through truth-revelation magic. They're stretched thin but effective.

The Tapassan community at Tapaspur has contributed **Sun-Hunters**—cold-blooded warriors who've discovered that their basking-focused magic can "warm" the Reft into quiescence. It doesn't destroy them, but a quiescent Reft can be safely transported and disposed of.

## Travel

### Major Routes

| Route | From | To | Condition | Dangers |
|-------|------|-----|-----------|---------|
| **Via Gemmarum** | Khaldera | Zircon | Fair | Bandits, occasional Reft |
| **Dragon Road** | Zircon | Auricollis | Good | Minimal (Dragon-kin patrol) |
| **Ruby Track** | Zircon | Rubrum | Poor | Rough terrain, Root Reft |
| **Emerald Way** | Zircon | Prasinum | Fair | Narrow, steep, Shadow Reft |
| **Diamond Path** | Zircon | Adamantum | Good | Heavily guarded |
| **Pilgrim's Path** | Zircon | Sunbask Plateau | Fair | Tapassan patrols |

### Transportation

**Pack animals** remain the primary method of moving goods. The hills are too steep for heavy wagons on most routes. Mules, donkeys, and the occasional elephant (Dragon-kin influence) carry gems from mines to markets.

**The Crystal-Carts** are a new development—small wagons equipped with experimental crystal-tech that reduces their weight for easier hauling. Still unreliable but promising.

**Travel time from Zircon:**

| Destination | Distance | Time (on foot) | Time (mounted) |
|-------------|----------|----------------|----------------|
| Khaldera | 90 miles | 5 days | 3 days |
| Auricollis | 50 miles | 3 days | 2 days |
| Rubrum | 45 miles | 3 days | 2 days |
| Prasinum | 70 miles | 4 days | 3 days |
| Adamantum | 60 miles | 4 days | 2.5 days |
| Sunbask Plateau | 25 miles | 1.5 days | 1 day |

## Trade

### Exports

| Good | Primary Source | Destination | Notes |
|------|---------------|-------------|-------|
| Cut gems (traditional) | Zircon workshops | Khaldera, Empire | Declining |
| Cut gems (tech-grade) | Zircon workshops | Tyrlóng, Dragon-kin | Growing |
| Raw rubies | Rubrum | Zircon, Dragon-kin | Steady |
| Raw emeralds | Prasinum | Zircon | Steady |
| Raw diamonds | Adamantum | Zircon | Steady |
| Gold | Pass-through | Various | Declining |
| Crystal-tech prototypes | Zircon | Various | New and growing |

### Imports

| Good | Primary Source | Notes |
|------|---------------|-------|
| Food | Delta Lands | Critical—hills don't grow enough |
| Timber | Forests beyond | For mining supports |
| Metal tools | Dragon-kin, dwarven | Mining equipment |
| Cobalt | Kobalthall (dwarven) | Crystal-tech component |
| Scholarly texts | Tyrlóng, Dragon-kin | Crystal-tech research |
| Labor | Refugees | Mining and construction |

### Trade Control

The **Gem-Cutters' Guild** controls finished gem exports. The **Prefect's Office** collects tariffs on everything else. The **Dragon-kin Factor** facilitates Dragon-kin trade separately. The system is inefficient, corrupt, and under pressure from all sides.

---

## Religion

### Official Practice

**Solarian Church** presence is nominal. The Cathedral of the Broken Sky was the regional seat; its destruction left a vacuum. A **Bishop** technically has authority, but the current occupant (Bishop Marcellus) spends most of his time in Khaldera, avoiding the Flagellants who've claimed his cathedral.

### Actual Practice

**Tapassan Tradition** is openly practiced by cold-blooded kin and increasingly by human converts. The **Shrine of the Received Sun** in Zircon is better-attended than the official cathedral. The growth of Tapaspur represents a major expansion of Tapassan presence.

**Axis Faith** elements exist among the mining communities—practical acknowledgment of Gwenaelle's mountain realm. The Pressure Temple at Adamantum is the most developed example, but shrines to the Peaks exist in most mining towns.

**Theosyn worship** (the old gods) is making a quiet comeback. The Hidden Temple to Eroswen in Zircon has never been busier. Small shrines to other Theosyn appear in private homes.

**Flagellant Bands** are increasingly visible. They gather at the Cathedral of the Broken Sky but range throughout the hills, preaching suffering and demonstrating it publicly. The Blood Field's influence is subtle but growing.

**Kobalthari Pattern-Reading** is practiced openly. Whether it's "religious" depends on definitions—the Kobalthari don't worship anything, but their reading of patterns has spiritual elements that attract human observers.

## The Scars

### Known Passing-Wounds

**The Sky-Break:** The region where the Cathedral of the Broken Sky stands is subtly *wrong*. The sky looks different from there—not obviously, but in ways that become apparent if you look too long. Stars are in wrong positions. The moon rises at incorrect times. Something broke when the Eldritch wake passed through.

**The Silent Seams:** Scattered throughout the mines are veins of stone that produce no sound. Tools striking them make no noise. Voices nearby become muffled. The miners have learned to avoid these areas—not because they're dangerous but because the silence is unnerving. The Kobalthari call them "memory-scars" and won't explain further.

**The Red Trickle:** The phenomenon at Rubrum's Blood Seam may be a localized Passing-wound rather than something that existed before. The correlation between the sealing and the Passing's timing is suspicious.

# Part Six: Adventure Hooks

## 6.1 The Pattern in the Deep

**Situation:** Sage Azuris has detected pattern-disturbances emanating from somewhere beneath Zircon itself—not from the known mines, but from somewhere deeper. The Kobalthari don't know what's causing it, but they're concerned enough to seek outside help.

**The Hook:** She's quietly recruiting capable individuals to investigate. Not officially—the Kobalthari don't want to alarm the human population. But she needs people who can explore tunnels, survive what they might find, and report back without causing panic.

**Complications:**
- The source appears to be in tunnels that aren't on any map—possibly natural caverns, possibly something older.
- The Guild Master has informers everywhere; any investigation will be noticed.
- The patterns suggest something is *waking up*—not the Sleeping Mines exactly, but something connected to them.

**Possible Discoveries:**
- A previously unknown connection between Zircon and the Sleeping Mines
- Crystal-tech artifacts of incredible age
- Something that's been waiting a very long time

---

## 6.2 The Folly's Secret

**Situation:** A young researcher has discovered that the Merchant Prince's Folly contains functional crystal-tech infrastructure—heating, lighting, and something else she can't identify. She wants to activate it but lacks the expertise (and the protection) to do so safely.

**The Hook:** She's looking for capable allies: someone who can navigate the Folly's dangerous politics, someone who can handle whatever security systems might still be active, and someone who can help her understand what she's actually activating.

**Complications:**
- The Council of Opportunists will want to control any activated systems
- The Prefect will want to know why she wasn't informed
- The original architects may have included safeguards against unauthorized activation
- Some of the Folly's current residents have built their homes directly on top of critical components

**Possible Discoveries:**
- The Merchant Prince was working with Dragon-kin contacts on something more than a palace
- The "unidentified" system is a communication device linking to... somewhere
- Activation will draw attention from parties who've been waiting for this

---

## 6.3 The Blood Crystallization

**Situation:** The Flagellants at the Cathedral of the Broken Sky are manifesting abilities that shouldn't be possible—and the manifestations are getting stronger. Someone needs to investigate before the Blood Field fully crystallizes in the region.

**The Hook:** Multiple parties want investigators: the Prefect (quietly), Bishop Marcellus (desperately), Sage Azuris (for pattern-research purposes), and potentially the Flagellants themselves (some of whom are beginning to suspect their "gifts" have a dark source).

**Complications:**
- The Flagellants are numerous and zealous
- Some of them genuinely believe they're serving God
- The manifestations are *useful*—healing, protection, power—which makes people reluctant to stop them
- The Blood Field may have already achieved partial crystallization; reversing it might not be possible

**Possible Discoveries:**
- A method to prevent full crystallization (though it may require sacrifice)
- The identity of what came through during the Passing and left this residue
- A Flagellant leader who knows exactly what they're doing and is feeding the Field deliberately

---

## 6.4 The Oracle Speaks

**Situation:** The Verdant Oracle at Prasinum has started speaking again—or at least, sounds are emerging from behind the century-old seals. The mining guild wants nothing to do with it. The Tiān-Phanes want access immediately. Someone will have to make a decision.

**The Hook:** The Prefect is looking for neutral parties to investigate—people with no stake in whether the Oracle should be opened, who can report honestly what they find.

**Complications:**
- The seals are weakening regardless of what anyone decides
- The Oracle's historical record suggests it tells true things that people don't want to know
- The Tiān-Phanes may attempt to access it independently if they're not given official permission
- The mining community will respond poorly to any attempt to open their deep workings

**Possible Discoveries:**
- The Oracle is a genuine pre-Imperial artifact with useful knowledge
- The Oracle knows something about the Passing—or about what's coming next
- The Oracle isn't an artifact at all; it's an entity that's been waiting

---

## 6.5 The Dragon-kin Offer

**Situation:** The Consilium Draconis has made a formal offer: full Dragon-kin protection for Zircon and the Jewel Hills, in exchange for administrative "partnership" and access to all crystal-tech research. The Prefect must decide.

**The Hook:** Various factions are seeking capable agents to influence the decision: the Prefect wants intelligence on what the Dragon-kin are really after, the Guild wants someone to argue for independence, Sage Azuris wants assurance that her people's interests will be served regardless of outcome, and the Dragon-kin themselves may have use for human intermediaries.

**Complications:**
- Accepting makes Zircon a Dragon-kin dependency; refusing risks losing their support entirely
- The Khaldera authorities (such as they are) will have opinions
- Some local human groups would rather die independent than live under Dragon-kin administration
- The Dragon-kin offer may be a test—refusing might be what they actually want

**Possible Discoveries:**
- What the Dragon-kin actually want is something they haven't mentioned
- There's a third option the obvious binary doesn't account for
- The decision will have consequences far beyond the Jewel Hills
