# Azurea: Greenmarches Sub-Region Development
## Round 2.2 — Regio Viridis / Glasfro

---

# Overview

| Element | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **Region** | The West (Provincia Occidentalis / Gorllewin) |
| **Imperial Name** | Regio Viridis |
| **Local Name** | Glasfro ("Green-Land") |
| **Capital** | Aber Glas |
| **City Density** | Moderate — 1 major city per 100 miles |
| **Character** | Transitional zone where forest meets farmland; contested traditions; market towns serving both worlds |

## Defining Characteristics

The Greenmarches exist in perpetual liminality—neither fully Imperial nor fully forest-folk, neither tamed nor wild. This is threshold country, where the great Kingswood dissolves into farmland through a gradual gradient of increasingly managed woodland, coppiced groves, and hedgerow-crossed fields. The people here have always been translators, mediating between the settled world and the wild.

**The Essential Tension:** Before the Passing, the Greenmarches thrived by maintaining relationships with both worlds—selling forest products to Imperial markets while honoring old agreements with forest spirits and Fae. Now the Kingswood has *closed*, severing half of that identity. The Greenmarchers must decide: are they forest-people trapped outside, or farmland-people who lost their edge?

# Part One: The Capital City

## Aber Glas — "Green River-Mouth"

### Location and Setting

Aber Glas sits where the River Glaswynn emerges from the forest into open country. The river arrives from the deep woods murky with tannins, a dark amber flow, and the town grew where it finally runs clear—hence "Green River-Mouth," referring to the color the water takes as it leaves the forest's shadow.

**Position:**
- At the forest edge, where tree-line gives way to managed woodlot and then open field
- The Glaswynn River bisects the town, flowing northeast toward the Heartland
- The Imperial Road (Via Silvae) crosses here, connecting to Caerderw in the forest and the Midlands beyond
- Three ancient trackways meet at the market square—older than any Imperial road

**The Setting:**
Standing in Aber Glas's market square at dawn, you see the forest to the west as a dark wall on the horizon, close enough that individual trees are distinct on clear days. To the east, the land opens into gentle rolls of field and pasture. The town exists precisely at the threshold—the last place where you can still *see* the forest before entering the settled world.

### Scale

| Measure | Pre-Passing | Post-Passing |
|---------|-------------|--------------|
| **Population** | ~35,000 | ~18,000 |
| **Function** | Major market; forest-edge trading hub | Diminished market; crisis of identity |
| **Character** | Prosperous, practical, bilingual | Anxious, divided, questioning |

### The Four Quarters

**1. The Forest Quarter (Goedran)**

*Location:* Western bank of the Glaswynn, closest to the tree-line

The old heart of the town, where forest-folk and traders once mingled. Buildings are predominantly timber-framed, many showing Fae-influenced designs—curved lintels, doors that never face directly north, foundation stones carved with binding-marks. The streets follow paths older than planning.

- **The Grove-Market:** Open space where forest goods were sold. Now eerily quiet.
- **Hostelries for forest-folk:** Several inns designed for guests who might need special accommodations—rooms without iron, gardens instead of courtyards, well-water rather than town-pipes.
- **The Green Chapel:** A small church built around a sacred ash tree. The tree is inside the sanctuary. This compromise allowed local faith to persist under Church authority.

*Atmosphere:* The quarter feels half-abandoned now. With the forest closed, the traders who filled these streets no longer come. Some buildings stand empty; others have been occupied by refugees from deeper in the woods who escaped before the closure.

**2. The Market Quarter (Marchfan)**

*Location:* Eastern bank, centered on the great market square

The Imperial-influenced commercial heart. Stone buildings, columned market halls, weighing houses, and guildhalls. This is where Aber Glas looked most like a proper Imperial town—and where it still functions most normally.

- **The Great Weigh-House:** Where goods were measured and taxed. Still operational.
- **The Merchant's Exchange:** Stone building with counting-rooms and contract-archives.
- **Guild Row:** Woodworkers, coopers, tanners, charcoal-burners—trades that processed forest products. Many now struggling.

*Atmosphere:* Busy but worried. The market still functions, but half its goods are gone. Traders who dealt in forest products are pivoting desperately to agricultural goods, finding fierce competition.

**3. The River Quarter (Glannau)**

*Location:* Along both banks of the Glaswynn, centered on the bridges

Fishermen, bargemen, and river-folk. Warehouses and wharves. The Glaswynn is navigable downstream to where it joins larger rivers flowing toward the Heartland—river trade was always Aber Glas's connection to the wider Empire.

- **The Twin Bridges:** Ancient stone bridges connecting the quarters. One is older, with spiraling carvings that pre-date the Empire.
- **The Bargemen's Hall:** Guild headquarters for river transport.
- **The Mudlarks' Row:** Poor housing along the waterfront.

*Atmosphere:* The river quarter functions. Barges still move. But the volume is down, and the bargemen are nervous—they've heard strange stories from upriver, where the Glaswynn emerges from the now-closed forest.

**4. The Field Quarter (Maesran)**

*Location:* Eastern edge of town, facing the farmland

Where agricultural goods entered the market. Granaries, livestock pens, and the residences of farmers prosperous enough to maintain town houses.

- **The Harvest Hall:** Great barn-like structure for grain storage and trading.
- **The Drover's Inn:** Famous establishment where livestock dealers gathered.
- **The Temple of Light:** The main Solarian church, built in proper Imperial style—conspicuously avoiding the compromises of the Green Chapel.

*Atmosphere:* Busier than before. With forest trade collapsed, the Field Quarter has become more important. Agricultural merchants are ascendant; they smell opportunity in crisis.

### Landmarks

**1. The Threshold Stone (Carreg Trothwy)**

At the exact center of the market square stands a stone that was old before humans came. A massive granite pillar, worn smooth, standing twice a man's height. All three ancient trackways converge on it. Market proclamations are made from its base. Oaths sworn here are considered especially binding.

The Solarian Church tried to have it removed. Twice. Both times, accidents befell the workers. Now a small shrine to Saint Aldric surrounds it—officially, the stone "represents" the saint's dedication to bringing Light to dark places. Nobody believes this.

**2. The Greengates**

Where the Via Silvae enters from the forest, massive oak gates stand in a stone arch. The gates themselves are rarely closed—they're too heavy to move easily—but they're carved with images of the forest's spirits, both bright and dark. Every traveler entering from the woods would touch the carved faces for luck.

Since the forest closed, no travelers have come through. The gates remain open, facing into a road that leads to paths that go nowhere. Some locals have begun leaving offerings at the base.

**3. The Forgetting Well**

In the Forest Quarter, a well that was sacred before the Church came. Folk tradition holds that if you drop something meaningful into the well and truly let it go, you'll forget whatever pain is attached to it. The Church officially closed the well two centuries ago. Someone keeps removing the covering stones.

Since the Passing, the well's waters have changed color. They're darker now. Some say they've seen shapes moving in the depths.

**4. The Governor's Hall (Neuadd y Rhaglaw)**

The Imperial administrative center, built in standard provincial style—columned facade, interior courtyard, offices for taxation and justice. It represents the Empire's claim on this transitional place.

Currently occupied by Rhaglaw Cadfan ap Morys, who received his appointment three years before the Passing and has no idea what to do with it.

**5. The Bridge of Two Ways (Pont Dwy Ffordd)**

The older of the twin bridges, with spiral carvings that scholars argue about. Some say they're proto-Uraeun threshold-marks; others claim they're Fae work. The bridge is narrow—barely wide enough for a single cart—but nothing has ever successfully widened it. Every attempt has failed through accident or inexplicable structural collapse.

Locals don't use it for heavy transport. They use it for moments of decision. When you're not sure which way to go, walk the Bridge of Two Ways, and by the time you reach the other side, you'll know.

### Atmosphere

Aber Glas smells of woodsmoke and river-water, of oak tannins and horse manure, of bread baking and wet wool. The sounds are of market-cries and hammer-falls, of the Glaswynn rushing beneath the bridges, of bells from both churches calling congregations that increasingly overlap.

Before the Passing, the town hummed with confident negotiation—everyone here knew how to deal with both worlds. Now there's an undertone of anxiety. People speak more quietly when discussing the forest. Children are warned away from the Greengates. The confident bilingualism of the Greenmarchers has become a painful reminder of a lost fluency.

### Who Rules

**Officially:** Rhaglaw Cadfan ap Morys, Imperial Governor

**Actually:** A tense balance between:
- **The Rhaglaw:** Trying to maintain Imperial authority with limited support
- **The Market Council:** Merchants who want pragmatic solutions regardless of tradition
- **Elder Derwen:** The Green Chapel's priest, spokesman for forest-folk values
- **Prior Aldhelm:** The Temple of Light's head, wanting to use the crisis to finally "civilize" the region

**The Power Dynamic:**

Cadfan holds nominal authority but lacks the garrison to enforce it (most soldiers died or deserted during the Passing). The Market Council controls economic life but is divided between those tied to forest trade (desperate) and those tied to agriculture (ascendant). Elder Derwen commands the loyalty of the Forest Quarter but can't deliver what they need—access to the closed Kingswood. Prior Aldhelm smells opportunity to finally bring the region firmly into Church control but lacks the Inquisition presence to force the issue.

Day-to-day, decisions emerge from exhausted negotiation among these factions. Nothing moves quickly. Everyone is waiting for something to change.

### The Tension

**The Core Conflict:** With the Kingswood closed, Aber Glas must redefine itself. Is it:
- A forest-edge town temporarily cut off, waiting for reconnection?
- A farmland market that should abandon its forest identity?
- Something new—a place of refugees and adaptation?

**Immediate Pressures:**
- Forest-folk refugees in the Forest Quarter are running out of savings
- Forest-trade merchants face bankruptcy
- Agricultural merchants want to absorb the failing guilds
- The Church sees an opportunity to eliminate "pagan" elements
- Someone—or something—is leaving offerings at the Forgetting Well

# Part Two: Secondary Settlements

## 1. Glasfynnon — "Green Spring"

### Overview

| Element | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **Imperial Name** | Fons Viridis |
| **Type** | Headwater town; pilgrimage site |
| **Location** | Upper Glaswynn, where the river emerges from springs at the forest's heart |
| **Pre-Passing Population** | ~8,000 |
| **Post-Passing Population** | Unknown / Inaccessible |

### Character

Glasfynnon was the Greenmarches' sacred heart—the springs where the Glaswynn is born were holy to traditions older than memory. The town existed to serve pilgrims and to manage the boundary where deep-forest met manageable-forest.

The springs themselves were tended by a mixed community: Green Chapel clergy, forest-spirit shrine-keepers, and Uraeun elders who maintained the threshold-sanctity of the place. Three traditions, suspicious of each other but united in recognizing the springs' importance.

**Notable Feature:** The Triad Shrine—three structures around the central spring: a chapel, a spirit-house, and a coiled threshold-stone. Pilgrims visited all three.

### Current State

**Cut off.** When the forest closed, Glasfynnon was inside the closure. No one has entered or left since.

The Glaswynn still flows. The water is darker than before—more heavily tannin-stained—but it flows. This suggests the springs still function, which suggests... something... is still there.

Refugees who escaped before the closure speak of the town's last days: spirits becoming agitated, the Uraeun elders saying the thresholds were "screaming," a growing sense that something was coming. Most left. Some stayed—to tend the springs, they said. To maintain what must be maintained.

**The Mystery:** Is Glasfynnon still inhabited? By whom? What are they experiencing inside the closure? The town represents everything the Greenmarches have lost access to—and everything they fear might be happening beyond their reach.

---

## 2. Pont Gwyn — "White Bridge"

### Overview

| Element | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **Imperial Name** | Pons Albus |
| **Type** | River crossing; market town |
| **Location** | Downstream from Aber Glas, where the Glaswynn crosses an ancient white limestone formation |
| **Pre-Passing Population** | ~12,000 |
| **Post-Passing Population** | ~9,000 |

### Character

A bridge town that served as secondary market for the Greenmarches, particularly for agricultural goods heading toward the Heartland. The "white bridge" is a natural limestone span—a collapsed cave roof now forming a geological arch that the river flows through. The town grew at this crossing point.

Pont Gwyn was always more Imperial than Aber Glas, more oriented toward the eastern farmlands than the western forest. The Church is stronger here; folk traditions are quieter.

**Notable Feature:** The Limestone Caves—a network beneath the town, partially explored. The caves connect to underground streams and show signs of ancient habitation. Some passages are sealed with stones carved in Fae work.

### Current State

**Prosperous by crisis standards.** With forest trade collapsed, agricultural trade has become more important, and Pont Gwyn is better positioned for it than Aber Glas. The town is quietly absorbing market share and refugees—becoming more important as the capital becomes less.

**The Political Situation:** Mayor Seren Wynlais sees an opportunity. If Aber Glas continues to decline, Pont Gwyn could become the Greenmarches' true center. She's not sabotaging her neighbor—but she's not helping either.

**The Caves:** Since the Passing, sounds have been reported from the sealed passages. Knocking. Humming. Something that might be voices. The Church has declared the caves off-limits. Not everyone is obeying.

---

## 3. Coedcraig — "Forest-Crag"

### Overview

| Element | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **Imperial Name** | Silvarupe |
| **Type** | Forest-edge fortress; charcoal-burners' center |
| **Location** | Where hills rise from the Greenmarches toward the Old Downs, at the southern forest edge |
| **Pre-Passing Population** | ~6,000 |
| **Post-Passing Population** | ~4,000 |

### Character

A fortified town at a rocky outcrop where the forest gives way to the chalk hills of the Old Downs. Coedcraig served two purposes: military (watching the forest edge for any threat emerging from the trees) and industrial (charcoal production for the iron forges of the Downs).

The charcoal-burners of Coedcraig were a distinctive community—people who worked *in* the forest but weren't *of* the forest. They had their own agreements with local spirits, their own traditions for entering and leaving safely, their own patron saints who were suspiciously similar to older forest guardians.

**Notable Feature:** The Crag-Tower—a fortress built on the rocky outcrop, combining Imperial military architecture with older stonework. From its top, you can see both the forest sea and the chalk slopes.

### Current State

**Anxious and armed.** Coedcraig lost its charcoal trade when the forest closed—but it gained a new purpose. The town is now the most heavily defended settlement in the Greenmarches, because it guards against what might come *out* of the closed forest.

Nothing has emerged. Yet. But Captain Rhodri Steelhand keeps his militia ready, and the Crag-Tower's signal fires are maintained. The charcoal-burners have become scouts, watching the tree-line with practiced eyes.

**The Fear:** Some refugees who escaped the closure came through Coedcraig. They speak of the forest's final days before sealing—paths changing, trees moving, something vast and aware shifting its attention. The charcoal-burners listen. They know the forest well enough to be terrified.

---

## 4. Maesrhyd — "Freedom Field"

### Overview

| Element | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **Imperial Name** | Campus Liber |
| **Type** | Charter market; free town |
| **Location** | Eastern Greenmarches, near the border with the Midlands |
| **Pre-Passing Population** | ~10,000 |
| **Post-Passing Population** | ~7,000 |

### Character

Maesrhyd holds an ancient charter granting it freedom from regional lordship—it reports directly to the Crown (when there was a Crown to report to). This status made it a haven for traders, craftsmen, and anyone wanting to escape local hierarchies. The town's culture is more egalitarian than typical Imperial settlements, with elections for its council and guaranteed rights for residents.

The charter dates to before the Empire's full consolidation of the West—a compromise that let a local folk-assembly persist under nominal Imperial sovereignty. Maesrhyd never forgot this.

**Notable Feature:** The Charter Stone—inscribed with the town's freedoms in both Imperial Latin and old Brythonic. Read aloud at every major market day.

### Current State

**Independent-minded and functional.** With Imperial authority collapsed, Maesrhyd's charter status has become moot—but the tradition of self-governance has made the town surprisingly resilient. The elected Council continues to function; the militia is organized; the market operates.

**The Politics:** Maesrhyd is debating its future. Some want to remain connected to whatever emerges from the Empire's wreckage. Others argue for formal independence—a free city-state in the chaos. A third faction whispers about old alliances, before the Empire, when the free peoples of this region governed themselves.

# Part Three: Notable Sites

## 1. The Hedgerow Labyrinth (Clawdd Ddryswch)

### Location
Five miles southwest of Aber Glas, where managed hedgerows give way to wilder growth at the forest edge.

### Description
A vast network of ancient hedgerows forming a deliberate pattern—concentric rings and spiraling paths covering several square miles. From above, the pattern would be clear; from within, it's a maze of green corridors, some barely wide enough for a single person, others opening into hidden meadows.

The hedgerows are old. Impossibly old. The hawthorn and blackthorn and wild rose have been growing here since before human settlement, and they show signs of careful maintenance that predates any human community in the region. Someone shaped these hedgerows. Someone tends them still—though no one admits to the work.

### History
Local tradition holds that the Labyrinth is Fae work—a boundary-garden created to separate the wild forest from the human lands. Walking the Labyrinth was once a pilgrimage: enter at dawn, follow the paths, emerge at the center by noon, return by dusk. Those who completed the walk were considered to have made peace with both worlds.

The Church discouraged this practice but never quite banned it. Too many locals—including several priests—had walked the Labyrinth in their youth.

### Current State
Since the forest closed, the Labyrinth has changed. The paths seem to shift—hedgerows that were passable last week are now impassible. New openings appear where none existed. The hidden meadows at various points have become... occupied. Not by people. By *things*—small, quick, glimpsed at edges of vision.

Some say the Fae are using the Labyrinth as a staging area outside the closure. Others say the Labyrinth is slowly extending itself, growing eastward toward the farms. The hedgerows at its edges are definitely advancing—a few inches each month.

**The Hook:** Something in the Labyrinth wants to communicate. Messages have been found—written on leaves, spelled in arranged stones, whispered in dreams to those who sleep too close. The messages are fragmentary, desperate, unclear. But they all say the same thing: *She remembers. She waits. The paths will open when the child comes home.*

---

## 2. The Burned Shrine (Yr Allor Losg)

### Location
Ten miles north of Aber Glas, on a low hill overlooking the Glaswynn valley.

### Description
The remains of a substantial shrine complex—stone foundations, tumbled walls, the outline of what was once a circular sanctuary. Everything above ground level was burned, long ago. The stones are fire-blackened; nothing grows in the central area.

The shrine was dedicated to something the Church found intolerable. Unlike most folk sites, which the Church either absorbed or ignored, this one was destroyed—deliberately, violently, with thoroughness that suggests fear rather than mere disapproval.

### History
Official records mention "the cleansing of a diabolic site" in the region during the Church's early consolidation, but provide no details. Folk memory is clearer but contradictory. Some say it was a Kasandran sanctuary—a place of sacred sexuality that the Church found particularly offensive. Others say it was Revnan—a mystery-site where initiates descended into darkness. Still others whisper that it was something older, something that even the Fae avoided.

What everyone agrees: the shrine was destroyed, its priests killed or scattered, its name deliberately forgotten. For centuries, locals have avoided the site. Bad luck, they say. Bad dreams.

### Current State
Since the Passing, the Burned Shrine has become active.

Lights have been seen at night—not fire, but a cold, blue glow emanating from the central foundation. Sounds have been heard—chanting in a language no one recognizes. On certain nights, the blackened stones are warm to the touch.

Most disturbing: people have begun dreaming of the shrine. The dreams are consistent across dreamers—they see the sanctuary intact, filled with worshippers, performing rituals of terrible beauty. They wake knowing something they can't quite remember, feeling grief for something they can't quite name.

**The Hook:** The Burned Shrine wasn't destroyed—it was *suppressed*. Whatever was worshipped there was too connected to the world to be truly killed. The Passing weakened the suppression. Now it's waking up. And it *remembers* what was done to it.

---

## 3. The Merchant's Folly (Ffolineb y Masnachwr)

### Location
Seven miles east of Aber Glas, on the main road toward Pont Gwyn.

### Description
A partially constructed stone building, clearly intended to be a grand manor house, now overgrown and abandoned. The foundations are complete; one wing rises to full height; the rest is tumbled stone and unfulfilled ambition.

The building was begun forty years ago by a merchant from Pont Gwyn who made a fortune in forest trade and wanted to establish himself as landed gentry. He chose this site because it offered views of both the forest and the farmland—symbolic of the wealth that came from bridging both worlds.

### History
The merchant, Cadwalader Richborne, poured his fortune into the project. Then things began to go wrong. Workers had accidents. Stones fell. Tools broke. The foreman died in his sleep—healthy one night, cold the next morning, with an expression of perfect terror on his face.

Cadwalader brought in Church exorcists. They found nothing. He brought in folk-practitioners. They found something—but wouldn't say what, only that construction should stop. Cadwalader ignored them. Two weeks later, he disappeared. His body was never found. Construction halted.

The site has been abandoned for thirty-eight years. No one will buy it. No one will salvage the stone. It sits, slowly crumbling, a monument to ambition that crossed a line.

### Current State
The Folly has become a haven for refugees and those who can't afford better. A small community has established itself in the completed wing—desperate people who figure that whatever haunts the place can't be worse than the Reft.

So far, they're right. The Folly's residents report strange dreams but no violence. Some even claim the place feels *protective*—as though whatever drove out Cadwalader is neutral toward those who come without ambition to conquer or control.

**The Hook:** The refugees have found something in the foundations—a sealed chamber that Cadwalader's builders apparently uncovered before the accidents began. They haven't opened it. They're debating whether to. Whatever's inside might explain what happened forty years ago—and might offer something valuable to those desperate enough to risk it.

---

## 4. The Passing Scar: The Silent Mile (Y Filltir Dawel)

### Location
A stretch of the Via Silvae between Aber Glas and the forest edge, beginning roughly two miles from the Greengates.

### Description
For exactly one mile, the road passes through a corridor of complete silence. Birds don't sing. Wind doesn't rustle. Hooves and footsteps make no sound. Words spoken emerge but seem to travel nowhere—like shouting into thick fog.

The silence isn't deafness—travelers can hear their own heartbeats, their own breathing. But all external sound is... absorbed. Swallowed. Gone.

### History
Before the Passing, this stretch of road was normal. The silence began during the Passing itself—travelers caught in the area reported a moment of absolute stillness before the eldritch things passed overhead. When it was over, the sound didn't come back.

### Current State
The Silent Mile is unavoidable for anyone approaching Aber Glas from the forest direction. Most travelers hurry through, uncomfortable with the unnatural quiet. Some find it peaceful—a rest from the world's noise. A few report that in the deepest silence, they heard something else: a voice, or voices, speaking from very far away, in words they couldn't quite understand.

The Church has blessed the road multiple times. The silence persists.

**The Hook:** The Silent Mile isn't natural, but it isn't hostile. Something is using the silence—creating a channel, a space where certain communications can occur without interference. Listeners who remain still in the Mile's center, who quiet their thoughts completely, sometimes receive messages. Fragments. Warnings. Coordinates. Someone—or something—is trying to reach the outside world, and the Silent Mile is one of the few places where the message can break through.

# Part Four: Key Figures

## 1. Rhaglaw Cadfan ap Morys

### Role
Imperial Governor of the Greenmarches (Rhaglaw = "Prefect/Steward")

### Background
A minor aristocrat from the Lawlands, appointed to this regional governorship three years before the Passing as a comfortable sinecure for a man whose family had connections but no particular distinction. Cadfan expected a quiet posting managing trade disputes and collecting modest taxes. He got the apocalypse.

Cadfan is forty-three, heavyset, balding, with the soft hands of a man who'd never expected to face real crisis. He was trained in law and administration, not leadership or war. Nothing prepared him for what he's dealing with.

### Character
**Strengths:** Genuinely decent, surprisingly fair-minded, more intelligent than he appears, willing to admit what he doesn't know.

**Weaknesses:** Indecisive, overwhelmed, frequently paralyzed by competing demands, drinks more than he should, secretly hopes someone else will solve everything.

**Voice:** Tends toward bureaucratic circumlocution when stressed, which is always. "The situation presents certain... complexities... which require careful... consideration of multiple... factors..."

### Goal
To survive until things get better. To not make anything worse. To somehow keep Aber Glas functioning until proper authority is restored—if it ever is.

### Complication
Cadfan knows his authority is borrowed time. The garrison that enforced Imperial law is gone—dead, deserted, or recalled. His power now rests entirely on inertia and the fact that no one else wants his job. If any of the competing factions decides to simply take over, he has no means to stop them.

He's begun having dreams about the forest. In the dreams, something is waiting for him at the Greengates. Something that knows his name. Something that wants to offer him a deal.

---

## 2. Elder Derwen Oakenshield

### Role
Priest of the Green Chapel; spokesman for forest-tradition communities

### Background
Born in Glasfynnon to a family that had served the threshold-shrines for generations. Derwen trained in both the Green Chapel's Christianity and the older practices it preserved. He understood the synthesis—how the faith of the Light could honor the sacred places without destroying them.

When Derwen was thirty, he was sent to Aber Glas's Green Chapel. He's been there for twenty-five years. He's seen the Church pressure increase, seen Rome's missionaries push for "purification," seen his tradition slowly marginalized. But the forest was always there, always a refuge, always a reminder that the old agreements held.

Now the forest is closed, and Derwen is seventy years old, watching everything he protected become irrelevant.

### Character
**Strengths:** Deep knowledge of both traditions, genuine spiritual authority, trusted by forest-folk and moderate Church members alike, calm under pressure.

**Weaknesses:** Age has slowed him, grief has hollowed him, he's not sure his faith—either faith—means anything anymore.

**Voice:** Speaks slowly, choosing words carefully, often pausing mid-sentence as though listening for something. "The tree... the tree inside the Chapel... it hasn't bloomed since the closure. Fifty-five years I've watched it bloom. Every spring. And now..."

### Goal
To preserve what he can of the green tradition. To maintain the sacred places within the Greenmarches until—if—the forest opens again. To die knowing he didn't abandon his duty.

### Complication
Derwen has begun hearing the tree. The sacred ash inside the Green Chapel, the one the building was constructed around, has started speaking to him in dreams. It tells him the forest isn't truly closed—that there are ways through, for those willing to pay the price. It tells him what the price is. Derwen hasn't told anyone. He's not sure if the voice is truly the tree, or something else using the tree, or his own aging mind inventing comfort.

---

## 3. Guildmistress Efa Brightwater

### Role
Head of the Glaswynn Bargemen's Guild; leader of the river-trade faction

### Background
Efa's family has worked the Glaswynn for six generations. She grew up on barges, learned to read the river before she learned to read words, and rose to leadership of the Bargemen's Guild through competence, toughness, and a gift for negotiation that made her valuable to everyone.

Before the Passing, Efa was wealthy and respected—the river connected everything, and she controlled the river. After the Passing, she's still respected, but her wealth is draining away. Forest trade was half the Glaswynn's traffic. With it gone, the Guild is struggling.

Efa is fifty-two, wiry and weathered, with the permanent squint of someone who's spent her life watching water and horizon.

### Character
**Strengths:** Practical, decisive, connected to information networks throughout the river system, uninterested in ideology, focused on results.

**Weaknesses:** Impatient with religion and tradition, sometimes too cynical, treats everything as a transaction.

**Voice:** Blunt and economical. "The river flows or it doesn't. The cargo moves or it doesn't. Everything else is just noise."

### Goal
To keep the Guild alive. To find new trade routes, new cargo, new reasons for the river to matter. To ensure that whatever emerges from this crisis includes a place for her people.

### Complication
Efa has heard things from her barge-captains. The upper Glaswynn, where it emerges from the closed forest, has changed. The water is darker, colder, and carries things—objects, debris, occasionally bodies—that shouldn't be there if the forest is truly sealed. Something is still happening inside the closure. Efa is quietly investigating, using her river network, trying to understand what's flowing out before anyone else figures out what might flow in.

# Part Five: Local Conditions

## The Reft Situation

### Prevalence
**Moderate.** The Greenmarches were not among the hardest-hit regions—the Passing's creatures passed overhead but didn't concentrate here—but the plague that followed was still devastating.

### Distribution

| Area | Reft Density | Notes |
|------|--------------|-------|
| Roads between settlements | Moderate | Travelers died; their Reft now wander the routes |
| Abandoned farmsteads | Moderate-High | Isolated families with no one to help |
| Forest edge | Low-Moderate | Something about proximity to the forest reduces Reft |
| The Silent Mile | None | No Reft enter; no Reft emerge |
| Towns/villages | Low | Vigilance and walls |

### Predominant Types

| Type | Frequency | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------|
| Root Reft (Land) | Common | Territorial, linked to specific places, predictable |
| Growing Reft (Life) | Moderate | Found in overgrown areas, dangerous but slow |
| Shadow Reft (Dark) | Moderate | Ambushers in wooded areas, fear the open |
| Empty Reft (Abyss) | Rare but increasing | Found near the Silent Mile and the Forgetting Well |

### Local Response
The Greenmarches have developed a distinctive Reft-management approach, drawing on forest-folk knowledge:

- **The Circuit:** Militia groups patrol regular routes, clearing Reft before they accumulate
- **The Signs:** Traditional markers at crossroads warn of Reft concentrations
- **The Agreements:** Some villages have noticed that certain offerings at certain places reduce Reft activity—no one understands why, but the practice spreads
- **The Burning:** Dead are cremated quickly; the green tradition's objections have been overruled by necessity

## Travel

### Primary Routes

| Route | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Via Silvae (west) | Blocked | Leads to closed forest |
| Via Silvae (east) | Functional but dangerous | Main road toward Midlands |
| Glaswynn River | Functional | Safest travel option; Guild barges offer protection |
| Old trackways | Variable | Some maintained by local communities, others abandoned |

### Practical Realities

- **River travel** is strongly preferred. The Bargemen's Guild offers armed escort services.
- **Road travel** requires groups of ten or more, armed, moving during daylight only.
- **Individual travel** is suicidal outside settled areas.
- **Horse availability** has crashed; most horses died in the Passing or were eaten afterward. Mules are now more common and more valuable.

### The Forest Problem
Before the closure, forest paths connected the Greenmarches to the Kingswood's interior—faster routes than the roads, known only to those with the right relationships. All of these paths are now inaccessible. This has isolated communities that depended on forest travel and cut off knowledge that moved through those networks.

## Trade

### What Flows In

| Good | Source | Status |
|------|--------|--------|
| Grain | Midlands, Grainmarch | Critical; Greenmarches not self-sufficient |
| Cloth | Eastern manufactories | Reduced but available |
| Metal goods | Old Downs forges | Stable |
| Preserved food | Various | High demand, high prices |

### What Flows Out

| Good | Destination | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| Forest products | N/A | Collapsed; no access to forest |
| Charcoal | Old Downs | Severely reduced; only from managed woodlots |
| Wool | Eastern markets | Growing; agricultural pivot |
| River fish | Downstream markets | Stable |
| Timber (salvage) | Various | Cutting existing woodlots, unsustainable |

### Trade Balance
The Greenmarches are running a trade deficit they cannot sustain. Without forest products, they don't produce enough to pay for the food they need to import. Current trade is being financed by accumulated wealth—savings, sold assets, depleted inventories. Within two to three years, this will be exhausted.

The agricultural faction argues for clearing more woodland for farming. The forest-tradition faction argues this will further damage relationships with whatever remains in the Kingswood. The debate has become increasingly bitter.

## Religion

### Official Practice
The Solarian Church maintains presence through:
- **The Temple of Light** in Aber Glas (Prior Aldhelm)
- Smaller chapels in each secondary settlement
- Itinerant priests serving rural areas (fewer since the Passing)

Official teaching emphasizes that the Passing was divine punishment for insufficient faith, and that the forest's closure is evidence of corruption that must be "purified" from the region.

### Actual Practice
The Greenmarches have always been syncretic. Most people:
- Attend Church services on holy days
- Also leave offerings at threshold-stones and sacred trees
- Honor ancestors in folk-tradition ways
- Treat the Green Chapel as spiritually equivalent to (or superior to) the Temple of Light
- Believe the forest spirits are real and must be respected

Since the Passing, this syncretism has intensified. Official Church attendance has dropped; Green Chapel attendance has increased. Folk practices that were "dying out" are being revived by younger people. The threshold-stones are being tended again.

### The Tension
Prior Aldhelm sees the crisis as an opportunity to finally "cleanse" the region of pagan influence. He's calling for Inquisition intervention, writing to Vandgwyn (hoping someone will respond), and preaching against "forest corruption."

Elder Derwen counsels patience and synthesis, but his position is weakening. The forest is closed; his tradition's power base is inaccessible. If Aldhelm can bring in external Church authority, the Green Chapel might not survive.

Most locals want both traditions to coexist. They're becoming increasingly frustrated with religious leaders who seem more interested in fighting each other than helping people survive.

## The Scars

### The Silent Mile
Described above. The most significant Passing-scar in the region.

### The Darkening Grove
An area of managed woodland five miles south of Maesrhyd where trees have begun growing at unnatural rates. The canopy has closed completely, creating perpetual twilight beneath. Animals avoid it. People who enter report disorientation and lost time.

The grove is expanding slowly—a few feet per month at its edges.

### The Wrong Spring
A spring near Coedcraig that produces water running uphill. The water flows from the spring, ascends a small rise, and pools at the top before evaporating. The effect is localized—maybe twenty feet—but it's consistent and it wasn't there before the Passing.

Local Uraeun (there's a small community near Coedcraig) are intensely interested in the Wrong Spring. They say it's a "threshold torn open"—a place where the between-state is bleeding into normal reality.

# Part Six: Adventure Hooks

## 1. The Glasfynnon Expedition

**Setup:** A survivor from Glasfynnon has emerged—not through the normal forest paths, but along the river, clinging to a log, delirious and aged decades beyond her years. Before dying, she speaks of "the ones who stayed," of "the spring that speaks," of "the door that's almost open."

**The Hook:** Someone needs to reach Glasfynnon. The forest is closed, but the Glaswynn still flows from within it. Could a party travel *upstream*, against the current, into the closure? What would they find? And is what's happening at the springs a threat that must be stopped—or a salvation that must be helped?

**Complications:**
- The river changes inside the closure; mundane navigation won't work
- The "door that's almost open" might be something that should stay shut
- The Church wants to send its own expedition, for its own purposes
- Something is aware of anyone entering the closure and adjusts accordingly

---

## 2. The Hedgerow Embassy

**Setup:** Messages from the Labyrinth have become more coherent. They're asking for a meeting—a representative from "the outside" to come to the Labyrinth's heart at the next new moon. The messages promise "knowledge of what was lost" and "the way to remember."

**The Hook:** Someone needs to walk the Labyrinth and reach its center. But the paths have changed; old knowledge of the route is useless. The journey will require navigating a maze that actively reshapes itself, possibly encountering the Fae who are using it as a staging area, and arriving at a meeting where the other party may want something impossible.

**Complications:**
- The Fae involved may be Dorcha-sí (dark/hostile) rather than Geal-sí (bright/friendly)
- "The way to remember" might refer to Katiari—knowledge that's dangerous to possess
- The Church has heard about the messages and is sending someone to "prevent demon-contact"
- The Labyrinth itself may be a test, and failure may have consequences beyond not arriving

---

## 3. The Burned Shrine's Dreaming

**Setup:** The shared dreams about the Burned Shrine have intensified. Now people are dreaming the same dream on the same nights—hundreds of people across the Greenmarches, experiencing identical visions of the shrine intact and in use. Something is building toward a climax.

**The Hook:** Someone needs to investigate the shrine before whatever is building reaches completion. What was worshipped there? Why was it destroyed? What's trying to return? And is it something that should be stopped, helped, or negotiated with?

**Complications:**
- The Church destroyed the shrine and has every interest in preventing its restoration
- The tradition that was destroyed may not have been evil—just inconvenient
- "Helping" might require acts the Church would consider damnable
- The entity returning may be damaged, incomplete, or corrupted by centuries of suppression

---

## 4. The River's Secret Cargo

**Setup:** Guildmistress Efa has quietly approached trustworthy outsiders. Her barge-captains have been finding things in the upper Glaswynn—objects that shouldn't exist, bodies that died in ways that make no sense, and recently, a child. The child is alive, about seven years old, and won't speak. She was found floating in a sealed barrel that emerged from the closure. She's terrified of light and makes patterns in the air that almost form words.

**The Hook:** Where did the child come from? Why was she sent out? What do her silent patterns mean? And what happens when whoever sent her realizes she's been found?

**Complications:**
- The child may not be entirely human anymore
- Her patterns might be messages, warnings, or something more dangerous
- The Church will want to "examine" her, likely destructively
- Something is tracking her—faint presences at the edges of vision, scratches on doors where she's slept

---

## 5. The Succession Crisis

**Setup:** Rhaglaw Cadfan is dying. Not from violence—from the slow despair that kills men who can't bear their burdens. He's drinking himself to death, and everyone knows it won't be long. When he dies, someone will need to take power in Aber Glas—and every faction is preparing.

**The Hook:** The transition of power will shape the Greenmarches' future. Will the Church faction take control and begin "purification"? Will the merchant council prioritize trade over tradition? Will the forest-folk faction make a desperate bid to preserve what remains? Or is there a fourth option—some way to unite the factions or find a leader no one expected?

**Complications:**
- Each faction has legitimate grievances and legitimate claims
- External powers (the Midlands, the Church hierarchy in Vandgwyn) may try to influence the succession
- Cadfan's dreams about the forest have become more specific—something is offering him a deal, and he's considering taking it
- The succession might be the trigger for whatever's building in the region to finally erupt

## Thematic Summary

The Greenmarches are about **liminality in crisis**—what happens to threshold-places when one of the things they connected to becomes inaccessible. The questions at the heart of this sub-region:

- Can you be a bridge when one end is cut off?
- What happens to traditions that depended on access now denied?
- How do people who defined themselves by negotiating between worlds survive when one world closes?
- What comes through thresholds that are damaged or desperate?

The region offers opportunities for adventures involving the Fae (through the Labyrinth), lost knowledge (through the sealed shrine and lost town), political intrigue (through the succession crisis), and mystery investigation (through the river's secrets and the Silent Mile's messages).
