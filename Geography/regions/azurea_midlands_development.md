# The Midlands (Regio Media)
## Sub-Region Development: Round 1.2

---

# Overview

**Imperial Name:** Regio Media
**Local Name:** The Commons
**Capital:** Mediolanium
**City Density:** Moderate — 1 major city per 100 miles, dispersed villages

**Character:** Rolling hills, mixed farming, "ordinary" Imperial territory. Neither wealthy nor poor. The backbone of the Empire—unremarkable but essential.

**Post-Passing State:** Quietly surviving. Less dramatic than other regions. Local lords and village councils maintaining order. The Reft are present but manageable with vigilance.

---

# 1. The Capital City: Mediolanium

## Names and Etymology

| Name | Meaning | Usage |
|------|---------|-------|
| **Mediolanium** | "Middle-Land" | Official Imperial |
| **Middleton** | Common translation | Popular usage |
| **Caer Canol** | "Central Fort" | Old Brythonic (rarely used) |

The name itself captures the city's character: it is in the middle—of the Heartland, of the Empire, of everything. Never the destination, always the place you pass through.

## Location

Mediolanium sits where three low ridges converge, creating a natural bowl with excellent drainage and defensible high ground. The **Communis River** (a modest tributary of the larger river systems) curves around the city's southern edge, providing water without the flooding problems of lower settlements.

**Distance from key points:**
- Aurheim: ~180 miles northeast
- Grannaria: ~150 miles east
- Lexium: ~130 miles north
- The Marchfields border: ~100 miles south

## Scale

| Metric | Pre-Passing | Post-Passing |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| **Population** | ~65,000 | ~35,000 |
| **Occupied Districts** | All | ~70% |
| **Functioning Markets** | 12 | 4 |
| **Garrison** | 2,000 | ~600 (mixed loyalties) |

## The Four Quarters (Plus One)

Mediolanium follows standard Imperial planning, but with a characteristic lack of grandeur. The streets are wide enough, the forums large enough, the temples tall enough—but nothing more.

### The Forum Quarter (Northwest)

The administrative heart. Built around the **Forum Medianum**—a paved square adequate for civic gatherings, neither grand nor cramped.

**Character:** Stone buildings that are solid rather than impressive. Colonnades that provide shade without pretension. The Prefect's Palace is three stories—one less than fashion demanded in the capitals, but sufficient.

**Notable Features:**
- **The Prefect's Palace:** Competent late-Imperial architecture. The current Prefect actually uses all the rooms rather than just the formal ones.
- **The Basilica of Moderate Justice:** The courts. The name is unofficial but universal. Sentences here were never spectacular—fair, if uninspired.
- **The Record Hall:** Archives of every tax assessment, census record, and property deed. Remarkably intact because nobody thought to burn them.

**Post-Passing:** Functioning. This is where refugees register, where disputes are settled, where someone is still trying to govern.

### The Market Quarter (Southwest)

Straddling the river, connected by the **Three Bridges** (stone, solid, unadorned). This is where the region's produce comes to be sold.

**Character:** Warehouses, granaries, livestock yards, inn-courts. Smells of hay, manure, and cooking food. The streets are worn into ruts by generations of carts.

**Notable Features:**
- **The Common Market (Forum Commune):** Daily trading for food, tools, cloth. Still functions, though goods are scarcer.
- **The Cattle Yards:** Livestock trading. Now also serves as the quarantine area for arrivals.
- **The Cider Houses:** Mediolanium's one famous export. Local cider rivals southern wines. The production continues, slightly defiantly.

**Post-Passing:** The heart of the city's survival. People who can trade food can eat.

### The Temple Quarter (Northeast)

The religious district. As expected: a Cathedral of the Light (appropriately sized for a provincial capital), smaller chapels, a seminary, and the Bishop's residence.

**Character:** The Cathedral is 150 years old, solidly built, with a tower that can be seen from across the region. It's neither beautiful nor ugly—it simply *is*, like the city itself.

**Notable Features:**
- **The Cathedral of St. Moderatus:** Named for a local saint whose primary virtue was "steadfastness." The name says everything about Midlands religious culture.
- **The Bishop's Residence:** Currently occupied by Bishop Honorius, who has managed to avoid both the Scouring and the Hierarchy's power games by being too unimportant to notice.
- **The Chapel of the Sending:** Originally the city's main temple before the Church rebuilt. Used for funerals. Some very old symbols in the stonework that no one mentions.

**Post-Passing:** The Bishop holds services. Attendance has changed character—fewer seeking salvation, more seeking community. The old chapel sees more use than before.

### The Commons Quarter (Southeast)

Where most people live. Dense housing, narrow streets, neighborhood wells, corner shrines.

**Character:** Buildings two to four stories tall, built of local stone and timber. Gardens wherever space allows. The streets twist because they followed older paths that predated Imperial planning.

**Notable Features:**
- **The Neighborhood Wells:** Nine of them, each the center of its district. Where news travels faster than any official messenger.
- **The Weavers' Close:** A street of textile workers whose guild still functions. They make practical cloth, not fine garments.
- **The Brewer's Row:** Cider production again. The industry that keeps Mediolanium relevant.

**Post-Passing:** Crowded with refugees, but managing. The neighborhood structure means people look after each other—and watch each other.

### The Fifth District: The Orchards (Outside the Walls)

Not technically part of the city, but inseparable from it. Apple and pear orchards stretch for miles around Mediolanium, tended by small-holders who sell their fruit to the cider houses.

**Character:** Rolling hills of ordered trees. Small farmsteads. Stone walls marking boundaries that have been stable for centuries. This is what Midlands prosperity looks like—nothing dramatic, just food growing where food has always grown.

**Post-Passing:** Many orchards abandoned when families fled or died. Some have been claimed by survivors. Some are tended by no one visible, yet the fruit still appears at market.

## Landmarks

### The Old Milestone

At the city's exact center stands an ancient milestone marking "MEDIUM ITER"—the middle of the journey. It predates the current city by centuries. Locals touch it for luck before traveling.

**The Truth:** The stone is older than the Empire. Older than the Church. Older than anyone remembers. It marks the center of something, but no one knows what. Since the Passing, people have reported dreams after touching it—dreams of a woman's voice saying "you're halfway there."

### The Steady Tower

The Cathedral tower. 200 feet tall, visible from twenty miles away on clear days. Its bell—the **Voice of Moderatus**—still rings the hours.

**The Truth:** The tower was built on foundations much older than the Church. The original builders are unknown. The bell sometimes rings when no one is pulling the rope, always at significant moments—though "significant" is often only clear in retrospect.

### The Three Bridges

Connecting the city across the Communis River. Stone arch bridges, wide enough for two carts to pass. Named **First, Second, and Third** because no one ever thought to give them proper names.

**The Truth:** The Second Bridge is subtly wrong. The stones don't quite match the others. Some claim it rebuilds itself when damaged—that stones which fall return to their places overnight. Engineers from Lexium visited once, measured everything, and left without publishing their findings.

## Atmosphere

**Sight:** Stone buildings in shades of grey and brown. Red tile roofs. Orchards visible from any high point. Nothing gleaming, nothing grand—but nothing crumbling either.

**Sound:** Cart wheels on cobblestones. The cathedral bell. Livestock in the market. Hammers from workshops. At night, very quiet—people inside, doors barred.

**Smell:** Apple blossoms in spring. Fermenting cider in autumn. Wood smoke year-round. The river after rain.

**Feel:** Solid ground, solid walls, solid people. A city that doesn't ask much and doesn't offer much, but keeps its promises.

## Who Rules

**Officially:** Praefectus Gaius Mundanus, Imperial Governor of the Midlands.

**Actually:** The same man, remarkably. Mundanus was appointed to this backwater as a dead-end posting. When the Passing came, when the capitals collapsed, when more ambitious men fled seeking better positions or greater safety—Mundanus stayed. He had nowhere better to go. And now he governs.

**The Reality:** Authority is shared between:
- The Prefect (civil administration, justice, defense coordination)
- Bishop Honorius (spiritual matters, charity, refugee assistance)
- The Guild Council (economic decisions, market regulation)
- The Neighborhood Elders (Commons Quarter internal affairs)

This works because everyone knows they need everyone else. The Prefect doesn't try to control religion; the Bishop doesn't try to manage markets; the guilds don't claim political authority; the elders handle their own people. It's the most functional government in the Heartland, and it emerged by accident.

## The Tension

**The Central Conflict:** Mediolanium is surviving. Not thriving, but surviving. This makes it attractive—to refugees seeking safety, to militant orders seeking bases, to warlords seeking resources.

The current balance depends on being unimportant enough to ignore. But word spreads. The Scouring has heard that the Bishop tolerates "folk practices." A Free Company has heard that the granaries aren't empty. A claimant to Imperial authority has heard that here is a functioning provincial capital ready for the taking.

How long can Mediolanium stay invisible? And what will its people do when they can't?

# 2. Secondary Settlements

## Bivium — The Crossroads Town

**Imperial Name:** Bivium ("Two Roads")
**Local Name:** The Cross

**Location:** Where the Via Communis (the main Midlands road) meets the Via Lateralis (the cross-country route to the Marchfields). Approximately 50 miles south of Mediolanium.

**Type:** Market town / way station

**Population:** Pre-Passing ~8,000 / Post-Passing ~5,000

**Character:**

Bivium exists because roads meet here. It has always been a place where travelers stop, trade, and move on. The town grew around a large inn-complex, the **Four Directions**, and expanded into supporting services: farriers, wheelwrights, food merchants, money-changers.

The center of town is the **Crossing Square**—a paved area where the roads meet, marked by a pillar carved with directional arrows. By tradition, disputes between travelers are settled here, with the town council serving as neutral arbiters.

**Notable Feature: The Four Directions Inn**

A sprawling complex of buildings, stables, and courtyards. Before the Passing, it could house 500 guests simultaneously. Now it serves as the town's de facto fortress—the walls are thick, the gates sturdy, and the interior courtyards can shelter the entire population during Reft incursions.

The current innkeeper, **Lucia Viator**, has become the town's effective ruler. She controls shelter, she controls food, she controls information. She's fair, but she's also clear: her rules or the road.

**Post-Passing State:**

Travel has decreased dramatically, but it hasn't stopped. Bivium remains crucial because it's the point where news from multiple directions converges. Lucia Viator has become one of the best-informed people in the Heartland—and she trades in information as readily as in beds and meals.

The Reft here tend to be Drifters—travelers who died on the roads and now wander them endlessly. The town maintains "Road Patrols" that clear the highways regularly.

---

## Collis Pomi — Apple Hill

**Imperial Name:** Collis Pomi ("Apple Hill")
**Local Name:** Pomhill

**Location:** 40 miles west of Mediolanium, on a series of gentle slopes famous for orchards since before Imperial records.

**Type:** Agricultural center / estate-town

**Population:** Pre-Passing ~6,000 / Post-Passing ~4,000

**Character:**

Collis Pomi isn't a town so much as a collection of estates. The great apple orchards here were divided among half a dozen noble families who competed to produce the finest cider. The "town" grew in the spaces between estates, serving the workers and housing the craftsmen who supported the industry.

The dominant feature is the **Cider Hall**—a massive building where the region's apple harvest is pressed, fermented, and aged. It's older than the Empire, rebuilt multiple times, and smells permanently of apples regardless of season.

**Notable Feature: The Widow's Estate**

Lady Agrippina Secundus was left alone when her husband and sons died in the Passing's first wave. Instead of fleeing, she opened her estate to refugees. Now the Widow's Estate houses over 300 people in a functioning community with its own gardens, workshops, and defense force.

Her success has drawn imitators. Three other estates now operate similarly. Collis Pomi has become an experiment in post-Imperial living—noble land redistributed not by revolution but by pragmatic necessity.

**Post-Passing State:**

The orchards still produce. The Cider Hall still operates. But the old competition between estates has been replaced by coordination—Lady Agrippina chairs a council of estate-holders (including some former servants who've claimed abandoned properties) that allocates labor and distributes food.

The Church is suspicious. This looks uncomfortably like the "communal living" they've always attributed to Kasandran heretics. But Bishop Honorius, visiting, found only desperate people doing what worked. He chose not to report it.

---

## Fons Veteris — The Old Spring

**Imperial Name:** Fons Veteris ("Old Spring")
**Local Name:** Elder Wells

**Location:** 60 miles northeast of Mediolanium, in a shallow valley where natural springs emerge from limestone.

**Type:** Religious site / healing center

**Population:** Pre-Passing ~3,000 / Post-Passing ~2,500

**Character:**

The springs here have been sacred since before humans arrived. The Fae remember when only they came to drink. The first human settlers built a shrine. The Empire built a bath-house. The Church built a chapel over the main spring and rededicated it to "St. Helena of the Waters."

The town exists to serve pilgrims and the sick. The waters have genuine healing properties—not magical, but mineral-rich and beneficial for certain ailments. The Church has always claimed the healings as miracles. The local people know better, but don't argue.

**Notable Feature: The Hidden Shrine**

Behind the official chapel, through a passage that officially doesn't exist, lies the original spring-chamber. It was never consecrated—the Church couldn't figure out how to sanctify something so obviously older than itself. Local families have tended it for generations, lighting candles, leaving offerings, speaking words in a language they no longer understand.

Since the Passing, the water tastes different. Sweeter. Those who drink from the hidden spring report dreams of a garden where nothing dies. The Kasandran faithful, scattered and hidden, have begun making pilgrimage here—they believe the Life-field is strong in this place.

**Post-Passing State:**

The sick still come. The officially-miraculous waters still flow. But now the hidden shrine sees more visitors than the chapel. Father Marcus, the local priest, has made his peace with this. He tends both places. He says the Light has many faces. The Bishop, wisely, hasn't asked for details.

---

## Castrum Communis — The Common Fort

**Imperial Name:** Castrum Communis ("Community Fort")
**Local Name:** The Fold

**Location:** 70 miles south of Mediolanium, near the Marchfields border, where the hills become rougher.

**Type:** Garrison town / refugee center

**Population:** Pre-Passing ~5,000 / Post-Passing ~7,000

**Character:**

Originally a military post protecting the road south, Castrum Communis grew into a town when retired soldiers were granted land in the area. It has always had a martial character—even the craftsmen know how to fight, even the children learn basic formations.

The central feature is the **Castrum** itself—a fortress that can hold 2,000 defenders and has never fallen. The walls are 30 feet high and 10 feet thick. The gates are iron-bound oak. The well inside is reliable and deep.

**Notable Feature: The Fold**

The open ground between the fortress and the town walls has become a permanent refugee camp. Called "the Fold" because it's where people without anywhere else to go are gathered, it houses perhaps 2,000 people in conditions ranging from acceptable to grim.

Commander Vitus, who runs both fortress and town, allows anyone into the Fold who can prove they're not Reft. But space inside the walls must be earned through work or service. This creates a class system: wall-dwellers and Fold-dwellers. It's not kind, but it's kept the place from collapsing.

**Post-Passing State:**

Castrum Communis receives a steady flow of refugees from the Marchfields, where conditions are worse. Commander Vitus has sent word to Mediolanium that he needs support—food, building materials, more defenders. So far, Prefect Mundanus has sent what he can, but it's not enough.

The fortress stands. The town survives. The Fold grows. Something will have to change.

# 3. Notable Sites

## The Drowsy Giant

**Location:** 30 miles west of Mediolanium.

**Type:** Geological / Metaphysical

**Description:**

A long ridge that, from certain angles, looks exactly like a man lying on his back, arms crossed over his chest, face turned to the sky. The resemblance is too precise to be coincidence. Locals call it the Drowsy Giant and have done so since before the Empire came.

**History:**

The Church declared it a natural formation—to say otherwise would be to acknowledge the Giants' existence as anything other than metaphor. But the old songs say this was Moderatus, a giant who surrendered rather than fight, and was allowed to sleep rather than be slain.

**Current State:**

Since the Passing, the Giant has been... restless. Not moving—nothing so dramatic. But the shape seems subtly different from year to year. And people who camp on the ridge report dreams of vast, tired patience.

Some Ostaran practitioners have visited, sensing the boundary between living stone and something that might be merely sleeping. They leave quickly, troubled.

**The Hook:**

Someone has begun building a shrine on the Giant's "chest." The construction happens at night. No one claims responsibility. The structure is angular, non-Imperial, unlike any local tradition. What is being worshipped here? And what might wake if the worship continues?

---

## The Silent Mile

**Location:** On the Via Communis, 25 miles south of Mediolanium.

**Type:** Passing-Scar / Null Zone

**Description:**

A stretch of road exactly one mile long where nothing grows, no birds fly, and sounds seem muffled. The stones of the road itself are unchanged, but the land on either side is grey and dead.

**History:**

The mile was normal before the Passing. Witnesses describe one of the Eldritch creatures passing directly overhead—not landing, not stopping, just moving through. Its shadow fell on this stretch of road. Where the shadow touched, something changed.

**Current State:**

No Reft appear on the Silent Mile. This would be reassuring except that nothing else appears either. Travelers who walk through report feeling watched, feeling judged, feeling *known*.

Some have disappeared on the Mile, though the road is straight and clear. They simply fail to emerge from the other end. Most of these had something to hide.

**The Hook:**

A survivor has emerged claiming to have spent three days on a mile of road—three days in a grey place where she was asked questions about her life. She answered honestly and was released. She won't say what the questions were. She walks with a limp now, though she wasn't injured.

What asks questions in the Silent Mile? And what happens to those who lie?

---

## The Whispering Circle

**Location:** 45 miles north of Mediolanium, in uncultivated hills.

**Type:** Ancient Site / Folk Tradition

**Description:**

A ring of standing stones—seventeen of them, roughly human height, arranged in a perfect circle about 100 feet across. The Church declared it a pagan relic and banned gatherings there. The ban was never effectively enforced.

**History:**

The stones predate human settlement. The Fae claim the stones were already ancient when they arrived. Someone carved faces into them—worn almost smooth now, but still visible if you know how to look. Seventeen faces. Neither human nor Fae.

**Current State:**

On certain nights—equinoxes, solstices, and dates that don't align with any known calendar—the stones whisper. Not words exactly, but patterns of sound that *almost* resolve into speech.

Since the Passing, the whispers have become clearer. People who listen too long can begin to make out phrases. The phrases are questions: "Are you ready? Are you worthy? Are you the one?"

Local tradition says someone will someday answer "yes" to all three. What happens then, the traditions don't say.

**The Hook:**

A local farm girl has begun visiting the stones at night. Her family found her speaking to them—or responding to them. She says they're "teaching her things." Her knowledge has become uncanny—she predicted the last Reft surge three days in advance.

Is she mad? Possessed? Or becoming something else? And what are the stones preparing her for?

---

## The Commons (The Moot-Field)

**Location:** 10 miles east of Mediolanium.

**Type:** Traditional Assembly Ground

**Description:**

A flat, open field where, before the Empire, the people of the region gathered to decide matters of common concern. The Empire banned the assemblies and built Mediolanium nearby to draw population away. But the field remained, and people remembered.

**History:**

The Moot-Field hosted the last free assembly four hundred years ago, when Imperial legions surrounded it and arrested the assembled leaders. Since then, it's been farmland—but no one ever built on it. Farmers would plow to the edge and stop. Houses were constructed within sight of it, but never on it.

**Current State:**

After the Passing, the first common assembly in four centuries gathered here spontaneously. No one organized it. People simply came—from Mediolanium, from surrounding villages, from farms and estates. They talked. They argued. They voted on common defense.

The assemblies have continued monthly since. Prefect Mundanus attends but doesn't preside. The Church doesn't know what to make of it. The people have discovered that they can still speak for themselves.

**The Hook:**

The Moot-Field is becoming more than a meeting place—it's becoming a symbol. Word has spread to other regions. Delegations have arrived from as far as the Lawlands, asking how it's done, asking whether they might join.

Is this the seed of something new? A restoration of something old? And how will the forces that benefit from Imperial structures—the Church, the surviving nobility, the militant orders—respond to a return of the common voice?

# 4. Key Figures

## Praefectus Gaius Mundanus

**Full Title:** Praefectus Provincialis of Regio Media, Keeper of the Moderate Peace

**Age:** 54

**Role:** Governor of the Midlands

**Appearance:** Average height, average build, grey-brown hair, unremarkable features. The kind of face you forget after meeting. This has served him well.

**Character:**

Mundanus was nobody's first choice for anything. He advanced through Imperial administration by being competent enough to avoid failure, quiet enough to avoid enemies, and unambitious enough to avoid suspicion. He was sent to Mediolanium as a pre-retirement posting—a quiet place to wait out his years.

Then the Passing came. Mundanus watched his superiors flee toward the capitals, watched the capitals descend into chaos, watched ambitious men fight over rubble while ordinary people died. He didn't flee. He had nowhere to go and no one to flee to.

Instead, he did his job. He organized food distribution. He coordinated defense. He settled disputes. He kept records—because someone should. He didn't try to be a hero; he tried to be useful.

**Goal:**

Keep Mediolanium functioning until something better comes along. Mundanus doesn't believe he's the right leader—he just hasn't found anyone more capable who wants the job. He'd happily retire to a farm if there were someone trustworthy to hand off to.

**Complication:**

Mundanus is discovering that he's actually good at this. Not brilliant, not inspiring—but steady, fair, and effective. The longer he governs, the more people depend on him, and the harder it becomes to imagine anyone else in the role.

But he's also discovering that "just keeping things running" requires making harder and harder choices. When resources are scarce, who eats? When danger approaches, who defends and who hides? He's becoming the authority he never wanted to be—and he's not sure the person he's becoming is someone he wants to be.

## Lady Agrippina Secundus of Collis Pomi

**Full Title:** Lady of the Pomi Estate, Mistress of the Orchards

**Age:** 48

**Role:** De facto leader of Collis Pomi, innovator of community estates

**Appearance:** Tall, angular, grey-streaked dark hair worn practical. Hands rough from work she was never raised to do. Eyes that have seen too much death and chosen to focus on life.

**Character:**

Agrippina was raised to be a noble wife—decorative, compliant, focused on social position. She married well, bore sons, managed her household. When the Passing took her husband in the first wave and her sons in the second, she was expected to retreat to a convent or throw herself on the Church's charity.

Instead, she opened her gates.

The estate had food, shelter, walls. Refugees had nothing. The equation was simple. She saved them. They worked. The estate survived. Others noticed. Now she leads a network of community estates that feed thousands of people.

**Goal:**

Prove that there's a better way. Agrippina has seen what noble privilege actually means—isolation, hoarding, letting others die to preserve your own comfort. She rejects it. Her estates demonstrate that shared resources mean more survival, that work dignified is better than charity humiliating, that community is stronger than hierarchy.

She would deny having any larger ambition. She'd be lying.

**Complication:**

The Church is watching. What Agrippina has built looks too much like Kasandran communalism—shared labor, shared meals, shared child-rearing, no clear hierarchy of family. The Scouring has burned communities for less.

And Agrippina herself is changing. She's found purpose, power, meaning. She likes who she's becoming. She's starting to think that if this works in Collis Pomi, it could work everywhere. She's starting to think she might be the one to spread it.

Ambition that grows from virtue is still ambition. And ambition attracts attention.

---

## Father Clement of the Three Parishes

**Full Title:** Priest of St. Moderatus (Mediolanium), St. Helena (Fons Veteris), and St. Lucia (Bivium)

**Age:** 61

**Role:** Rural priest, quiet heretic, keeper of old ways

**Appearance:** Weathered, white-bearded, walks with a stick that may or may not be necessary. Wears the robes of the Light but has decorated them with embroidered patterns that aren't quite Church-approved.

**Character:**

Clement has been a priest in the Midlands for thirty-five years. He knows every family, every farm, every corner shrine that the Church pretends doesn't exist. He says the approved prayers. He also says the older ones, the ones that were here before the Church, the ones that people remember in their bones.

He has never believed these are contradictions. The Light is real. So are the spirits of the wells and the old powers of the earth. Why should acknowledging one mean denying the other?

The Church would call this heresy. Clement calls it pastoral care. People need what helps them. He provides it.

**Goal:**

Keep his flock alive and hopeful until the darkness passes. Clement doesn't care about theological correctness—he cares about the grandmother who needs blessing for her grandson's grave, the farmer who needs the field-spirits appeased, the young mother who needs to believe her lost child is somewhere peaceful.

**Complication:**

Father Clement's compromises are becoming harder to hide. The Scouring has begun investigating "folk contamination" in rural parishes. If they learn what Clement has been doing—the pre-Church blessings, the spirit-offerings, the quiet tolerance of practices the Church forbids—they'll make an example of him.

And Clement has been having dreams lately. Dreams of a woman he's never seen, who thanks him for keeping the old ways alive, who tells him he's part of something larger than he knows. The dreams comfort him, but they also frighten him. What has he been serving, all these years? And what might it ask of him now?

# 5. Local Conditions

## The Reft Situation

**Density:** Moderate. The Midlands has Reft, but fewer than more densely populated regions.

**Distribution:**

| Location | Density | Predominant Type |
|----------|---------|------------------|
| Roads | Low-Moderate | Drifters |
| Abandoned villages | High | Repeaters, Sitters |
| Near Fons Veteris | Low | Growing Reft (attracted to the springs) |
| The Silent Mile | None | (Something else) |
| The Commons | Very Low | None appear near the Moot-Field |

**Types Predominant:**

- **Drifters:** Former travelers, wandering the roads. Dangerous if encountered alone, but predictable.
- **Repeaters:** Found in abandoned villages, miming their former lives. Harvesting empty fields. Tending dead animals. Deeply unsettling but not immediately aggressive.
- **Root Reft:** Territorial, found near old boundary markers and ancient tree-lines. They don't leave their territory but kill anything entering it.

**Community Response:**

- Road Patrols clear major routes weekly
- Village Defense Rotations maintain nightly watch
- "The Count"—a census of confirmed Reft in the area, updated monthly
- "The Mercy"—teams that put down known Reft, viewed as grim but necessary duty

## Travel

**Status:** Possible but cautious.

**Road Quality:**

| Road | Condition | Safety |
|------|-----------|--------|
| Via Communis (main north-south) | Good | Patrolled, moderate risk |
| Via Lateralis (east-west) | Fair | Less patrolled, higher risk |
| Estate roads | Variable | Dependent on local maintenance |
| Village paths | Poor | Used only by locals who know them |

**Travel Methods:**

- **Convoy:** Most common. Multiple wagons traveling together with armed escort.
- **Fast Rider:** Lone messengers on fast horses. High risk, high speed.
- **Night Camp:** Forbidden. Anyone caught outside walls after dark is suspected of being Reft-touched.

**Travel Time:**

- Mediolanium to Bivium: 2 days by convoy
- Mediolanium to Collis Pomi: 1.5 days
- Mediolanium to Aurheim: 8-10 days minimum (dangerous journey)

## Trade

**What Flows Out:**

- Cider (the Midlands' famous export, still produced)
- Grain (surplus from functional farms)
- Wool (sheep survive better than cattle)
- Leather goods (tanning continues)

**What Flows In:**

- Metal goods (local smiths exist but lack quality ore)
- Salt (essential, scarce, expensive)
- Medicine (Lexium's pharmacies still produce)
- Information (worth more than gold)

**Trade Routes:**

- Primary: North to Aurheim/Vandgwyn (disrupted but active)
- Secondary: East to Grannaria (most reliable)
- Tertiary: South to Marchfields (military goods only)

**Currency:**

Imperial coinage still accepted, but barter increasingly common. A chicken is worth a chicken regardless of whose face is on the coins.

## Religion

**Official:** The Church of the Light, administered by Bishop Honorius from Mediolanium.

**Actual Practice:**

| Practice | Prevalence | Church Response |
|----------|------------|-----------------|
| Light worship (orthodox) | Universal (nominal) | Approved |
| Ancestor acknowledgment | Very common | Tolerated with unease |
| Spring/well offerings | Common | Officially forbidden, practically ignored |
| Harvest festivals | Universal | Renamed "Saints' Days," content unchanged |
| Stone circle gatherings | Rare but increasing | Unknown (conducted secretly) |

**The Reality:**

The Midlands never fully converted. They said the words, built the churches, attended the services—but they also kept the old ways in the back of their minds and the corners of their barns. Father Clement is not unusual; he's just more aware of what he's doing.

Since the Passing, the old ways have crept back further. The Church's authority is diminished. The Light didn't protect them. But the wells still flow, the stones still stand, and the harvests still come to those who remember how to ask properly.

## The Scars

**The Silent Mile:** (Detailed above) A Null-zone where the Passing left permanent absence.

**The Grey Field:** Near Collis Pomi, an orchard that died in a single night. The trees stand, but they're grey—not dead, not alive, not rotting. Fruit appears on them sometimes. No one has eaten it and no one will.

**The Weeping Stone:** A boulder on a hillside that runs with water even in drought. Since the Passing, the water is faintly pink. It smells like tears. The Church says it's a miracle. Local tradition says it's grief made manifest—but whose grief, they cannot say.

---

# 6. Adventure Hooks

## Hook 1: The Returning Dead

**Setup:** A village near Fons Veteris reports that their dead are returning—but not as Reft. The deceased are appearing in mirrors, in still water, in polished metal. They're trying to communicate. Something has gone wrong with their journey to Ostara's realm.

**Investigation Leads:**
- The village's gravekeepers have been performing "simplified" burial rites for years, omitting certain prayers
- The hidden spring at Fons Veteris has been flowing more strongly, and those who drink from it dream of the dead
- A figure called the "Veiled Mourner" has been seen at the cemetery, and she is neither living nor Reft

**Possible Revelations:**
- The simplified rites accidentally blocked the dead's passage
- The spirits are trapped at a threshold, not malevolent but lost
- The Veiled Mourner is a Gāstberend (psychopomp) who sensed the problem and came to investigate—but she needs help from the living to fix it

**Complications:**
- The Church considers speaking with the dead to be necromancy
- Some villagers want their loved ones to stay, even if trapped
- Fixing the problem requires acknowledging that the "approved" Church rites weren't working

## Hook 2: The Giant's Dream

**Setup:** People living near the Drowsy Giant are having the same dream—a vast, slow voice asking them to "wake me when they come." They don't know who "they" are. The dreams are becoming more insistent.

**Investigation Leads:**
- The mysterious construction on the Giant's chest is a temple, and it's nearly complete
- Records in Lexium mention "Moderatus the Merciful," a giant who surrendered—and who was given a sacred duty instead of death
- The Silent Mile is expanding, slowly, in the direction of the Drowsy Giant

**Possible Revelations:**
- Moderatus was set to guard something—a passage, a prisoner, a seal
- "They" are entities from outside creation who will try to pass through the Midlands
- The temple being built is designed to wake Moderatus prematurely—or to prevent him from ever waking

**Complications:**
- Waking Moderatus might be necessary—or catastrophic
- The temple-builders are not malevolent, but misguided
- Moderatus's "sacred duty" may have been set by beings no longer present to give guidance

## Hook 3: The Common Voice

**Setup:** The monthly assemblies at the Moot-Field have attracted attention. A delegation from the Marchfields has arrived asking to join—but so has a representative of the Scouring, demanding to know why the Church was not informed of these "seditious gatherings."

**Investigation Leads:**
- The Scouring representative has orders to find evidence of heresy—any evidence
- The Marchfields delegation is fleeing a commander who has declared himself "Protector" and is conscripting everyone
- The Moot-Field itself has begun to react to gatherings—the grass grows greener, the air feels clearer, and some participants report hearing voices from the past

**Possible Revelations:**
- The Moot-Field is a place of power—political assemblies held there generate genuine metaphysical force
- The old assemblies were banned not because they were "pagan" but because they threatened Imperial authority by demonstrating that people could govern themselves
- The Scouring representative has a personal agenda beyond his orders

**Complications:**
- Protecting the assemblies means defying the Church openly
- Accepting the Marchfields delegation means potentially provoking their "Protector"
- The growing power of the Moot-Field will eventually attract attention from forces that make the Scouring look benign

## Hook 4: The Widow's War

**Setup:** Lady Agrippina's community estates have become too successful to ignore. A neighbor-lord—one who kept his estate closed, hoarded his resources, and watched refugees starve—has accused her of theft, claiming the refugees she sheltered "stole" his abandoned crops and livestock.

**Investigation Leads:**
- The accusation has legal merit under Imperial property law
- The accusing lord, Quintus Avarus, has the support of other nobles who fear Agrippina's example
- Quintus has hired a Free Company to "reclaim his property"—meaning to expel Agrippina's refugees

**Possible Revelations:**
- Quintus is in debt to the Hierarchy in Vandgwyn, who would benefit from discrediting Agrippina's model
- The abandoned farms were genuinely abandoned—Quintus's people fled or died, and he only "reclaimed" them on paper after Agrippina's people had restored them
- This is a test case—if Quintus wins, every community estate in the Midlands is vulnerable

**Complications:**
- Legal resolution would require appealing to Aurheim or Vandgwyn, both of which are controlled by interests hostile to Agrippina
- Military resolution means open war, which would devastate everyone
- Agrippina is considering a third option—transforming her defensive community into something more assertive

## Hook 5: The Questions of the Mile

**Setup:** A young scholar from Lexium has begun systematically studying the Silent Mile. She's documented that travelers who disappear aren't random—they share characteristics. And she believes she knows what questions are being asked, and why.

**Investigation Leads:**
- The disappeared share a common trait: they were carrying significant secrets—crimes concealed, truths unspoken, identities hidden
- The scholar, Marcella Veritas, has developed a theory: the Mile is a Threshold maintained by something that judges
- Marcella wants to walk the Mile herself, carrying a specific secret, to test whether honest confession allows passage

**Possible Revelations:**
- The Mile exists because Katiari's presence lingers at boundaries—and this boundary has become a place of truth
- Those who answer honestly pass through; those who lie are... kept
- What keeps them is not malevolent, but it is hungry—hungry for truth in a world of lies

**Complications:**
- Marcella's theory might be wrong; she might simply disappear
- If she's right, the Mile is a resource—a place to extract truth—but using it would mean deliberately sending people into potential oblivion
- The Mile's expansion suggests its "questions" are becoming more urgent; what happens when it reaches inhabited areas?

## The Midlands Character

**What Makes It Special:**

The Midlands is the Empire's backbone—not its brain, not its heart, not its sword. It's where ordinary people lived ordinary lives, where nothing dramatic happened, where things simply *worked*.

**Post-Passing Theme:**

That ordinariness is now a strength. Mediolanium survives because its people know how to cooperate without drama. The community estates work because the Midlands never forgot how to share. The old traditions resurface because they were never far below the surface.

The Midlands offers hope—not the dramatic hope of heroes and prophecies, but the quiet hope that ordinary people can build something better if they work together.

**The Tension:**

This hope attracts attention. Forces that benefit from the old structures—the Church, the surviving nobility, ambitious warlords—see the Midlands as a threat. Not because it rebels, but because it demonstrates that rebellion isn't necessary. You can simply build something else.

How long before someone decides to destroy what the Midlands is becoming? And what will its ordinary people do when that moment comes?
