# Azurea: Grainmarch Sub-Region Development
## Regio Frumentaria — The Breadbasket

---

# Overview

**Imperial Name:** Regio Frumentaria
**Local Name:** The Breadbasket (or simply "The March")
**Regional Affiliation:** Heartland (Provincia Cordis)
**Capital:** Grannaria
**City Density:** High — 1 major city per 60 miles, many market towns

**Character:** The Grainmarch is the Empire's stomach. Flat river plains spreading from the Altheim Plateau's base, laced with the most extensive canal network in the known world. This is practical territory—less pious than the Crown Lands, less refined than the Lawlands, but absolutely essential. Before the Passing, nearly half the Empire's grain passed through Grannaria's massive stone silos. Now, whoever controls the Grainmarch controls who eats and who starves.

**Geography:**
- Convergence of the Heartland's three major rivers: the Vitaflumen (Life-River), the Copia (Abundance), and the Tardus (Slow-Water)
- Extensive canal networks radiating like spokes from Grannaria
- Flat, fertile alluvial plains stretching to the horizon
- Massive granary complexes at key distribution points
- Seasonal flooding that enriches the soil but threatens settlements
- Windmills and water-wheels dotting every waterway

**Post-Passing State:** The Grainmarch lost perhaps 70% of its population—not unusual for the Empire—but its strategic importance has only increased. The Council of Merchants controls Grannaria, but their grip is contested. Militant orders circle like crows, knowing that grain is power. The canals still flow, the fields can still produce, but there aren't enough hands to work them and too many mouths demanding their share.

# Part One: The Capital — Grannaria

## Basic Information

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Imperial Name** | Grannaria |
| **Local Name** | The Granary City, The Stone Silos |
| **Location** | Where the Vitaflumen, Copia, and Tardus rivers converge, 120 miles downstream from the Altheim Plateau |
| **Pre-Passing Population** | ~180,000 |
| **Post-Passing Population** | ~40,000 |
| **Current Ruler** | The Council of Merchants (seven members) |
| **Religious Character** | Officially Solarian; strong Alysian folk traditions among farmers; Kasandran fertility rites "tolerated" |

## Geography and Layout

Grannaria sprawls across the river convergence, built on what was once marshy delta before Imperial engineers transformed it. The city is dominated by its granaries—massive stone cylinders rising like fortresses, some over a hundred feet tall. The streets follow the canal network rather than any grid; locals navigate by which granary district they're in rather than street names.

**The Three Waters:**
- **Vitaflumen** (Life-River): Largest, flows from the northeast, carries most barge traffic
- **Copia** (Abundance): From the northwest, seasonal flooding makes it treacherous but enriches surrounding fields
- **Tardus** (Slow-Water): From the south, sluggish but deep, ideal for heavy cargo

**The Confluence:** Where all three rivers meet is called the Trivium—a triangular island that has been built up over centuries into the city's commercial heart.

## The Five Districts

### 1. The Trivium (Commercial Heart)

**Character:** The island where the rivers meet. The true power center—not government buildings but the Market-Square where grain prices are set, the Weighing Houses where disputes are settled, and the guild halls where fortunes are made.

**Notable Features:**
- **The Market-Square (Forum Frumentaria):** Paved in white stone, large enough to hold 10,000 traders. Stone pillars display current prices for wheat, barley, rye, and millet.
- **The Great Weighing House:** Where all official grain transactions must be measured and recorded. The Scales of Truth are said to be blessed (or cursed—depends who you ask) to reject dishonest measures.
- **The Grain-Masters' Guildhall:** Once the most powerful building in the city. Now contested between the old guild and the new Council.

**Post-Passing:** The Market-Square still functions, but trading happens in hushed tones. The price pillars show numbers that would have caused riots before the Passing. The Weighing House operates under Council control, every transaction taxed.

### 2. The Silo Quarter (Granary District)

**Character:** The eastern district, dominated by the great stone granaries. The air here smells of dust and dried grain. Workers call it "the Lungs" because the grain dust gets into everything.

**Notable Features:**
- **The Twelve Giants:** The largest granaries, each named for the Emperor under whom it was built. Only four are currently in use.
- **The Rat-Catchers' Shrine:** A small temple to Ostara (disguised as a Solarian chapel) where the rat-catchers pray for success. The rats got worse after the Passing.
- **The Silo-Keeper's Tower:** Administrative center for granary operations. The current Silo-Keeper, Marcus Duro, is functionally the Council's enforcer.

**Post-Passing:** The granaries stand one-third full—enough to feed the reduced population, but not enough surplus to export. Guards patrol constantly; grain theft is now punishable by death.

### 3. The Canal Quarter (Working District)

**Character:** Northern district where the canal workers, barge crews, and day laborers live. Modest wooden buildings, narrow waterways, the smell of fish and river water. Rougher than the Trivium but vital—nothing moves without canal labor.

**Notable Features:**
- **The Bargemen's Rest:** Largest tavern, unofficial hiring hall, and the place where labor disputes get settled (sometimes violently)
- **The Lock-Keeper's Row:** Housing for the specialists who maintain the canal locks. Their skills are irreplaceable.
- **The Children's Quay:** Where orphans and street children gather. Before the Passing, they were a nuisance; now they're organized under a figure called "the Dock-Mother."

**Post-Passing:** The Canal Quarter has become the most politically volatile district. Workers know their labor is essential and have begun demanding better conditions. The Council is nervous.

### 4. The Mill Quarter (Industrial District)

**Character:** Southern district where the grain is processed. Windmills and water-wheels crowd the skyline. The constant grinding sound is audible throughout the district. Miller families have worked here for generations.

**Notable Features:**
- **The Forty Mills:** Actually sixty-three mills of various sizes, but the name stuck from an older count
- **Miller's Hall:** Where the Miller's Guild meets. Still powerful—grain is useless without milling
- **The Dust Church:** A Solarian chapel perpetually coated in flour dust. The local priest, Father Albinus, ministers to mill workers and has become an unexpected voice for labor rights.

**Post-Passing:** Many mills stand idle due to labor shortages. The Miller's Guild has begun training women and older children, breaking centuries of tradition out of necessity.

### 5. The Outer Fields (Agricultural Belt)

**Character:** Not a district proper, but the ring of farms and villages immediately surrounding the city walls. These supply Grannaria's daily needs and represent the transition between urban and rural Grainmarch.

**Notable Features:**
- **The Sunday Markets:** Where farmers bring produce directly to city-dwellers
- **The Flood Walls:** Ancient earthworks protecting the city from seasonal flooding
- **The Watchtowers:** Originally for flood warning; now manned to watch for Reft

**Post-Passing:** Many outer farms are abandoned, their fields going fallow. Those still worked are often fortified, their farmers armed. The Sunday Markets are shadows of their former selves.

## Major Landmarks

### The Great Weighing House

The symbolic heart of the Grainmarch's economy. A massive stone building on the Trivium, its entrance flanked by statues of Plenty (a woman with grain sheaves) and Justice (a blindfolded figure with scales). Inside, the Scales of Truth—enormous bronze balances that supposedly cannot be cheated. Every major grain transaction must be weighed here and recorded in the Ledgers.

**History:** Built three centuries ago after a scandal involving falsified weights. The Scales were blessed by a Theosyn priest (though the records now claim a Solarian bishop). Merchants whisper that the Scales retain some of that divine attention.

**Current State:** The Council has placed their own officials in charge of the Ledgers. There are rumors of "adjusted" weights for favored parties.

### The Twelve Giants

The great granaries themselves—stone cylinders up to 120 feet tall and 60 feet in diameter, with walls three feet thick. Named for the Emperors who commissioned them: Aurelius, Constantius, Flavius, and so on. Each can hold enough grain to feed 10,000 people for a year.

**History:** Built over two centuries during the Empire's height. Some incorporate older structures—pre-Imperial granaries of a cruder design. The deepest foundations are rumored to include burial chambers from an even earlier civilization.

**Current State:** Only four of the twelve are in regular use. Others are sealed ("for future storage"), used as emergency housing, or simply too damaged to maintain. The granary called Caligulus has been closed since the Passing; workers report hearing sounds from within.

### The Triumvirate Bridges

Three bridges connecting the Trivium island to the surrounding city—one for each river. Each bridge is wide enough for four wagons and lined with merchant stalls. They are named for the rivers they cross: Vita-Bridge, Copia-Bridge, and Tarda-Bridge.

**History:** Built as a single project two centuries ago, replacing older wooden bridges. The engineering was considered a marvel—some of it borrowed from dwarven techniques via the Axis Faith.

**Current State:** All three bridges are controlled by Council checkpoints. Tolls are extracted from everyone entering or leaving the Trivium.

### The Flood Temple

A Solarian cathedral built on the highest point in the city, supposedly safe from any flood. The tower offers the best view of the surrounding plains—and the approaching threats.

**History:** Originally a temple to Atargatis (the Sea/Depths realm), converted to Solarian worship three centuries ago. The conversion was never quite complete; water-themed mosaics remain, and the basement contains an ancient cistern that connects to the river system.

**Current State:** The Flood Temple has become a sanctuary for refugees and the homeless. Father Cassius, the ranking priest, focuses more on charity than doctrine, much to the Hierarchy's frustration.

## Current Authority

**The Council of Merchants**

Seven merchants who seized power from the Imperial Governor in the chaos following the Passing. They present themselves as practical administrators keeping the city fed and functioning. Critics call them war profiteers.

**Council Members:**

| Name | Portfolio | Character |
|------|-----------|-----------|
| **Quintus Severinus** | Chairman, External Trade | Oldest member; remembers the old order; wants stability above all |
| **Lucia Manceps** | Grain Reserves | Controls the granary keys; paranoid about shortages |
| **Marcus Fabianus** | Canal Operations | Former barge captain; closest to working class; conflicted loyalties |
| **Helena Aurata** | Banking & Credit | From old money; sees opportunity in chaos; coldly calculating |
| **Gaius Portus** | River Defense | Commands the city's small militia; increasingly authoritarian |
| **Titus Molitor** | Mill Operations | Miller's Guild representative; advocates for artisan interests |
| **Decimus Corvus** | "Special Concerns" | Handles things the others don't want to know about |

**The Balance of Power:**

The Council rules by controlling three things: the granary keys, the canal locks, and the militia. But their authority is fragile. The Guilds (especially the Millers and Bargemen) could paralyze the city. The Church still commands spiritual loyalty. And outside forces are circling.

## The Tension

**The Siege That Isn't:**

The Scouring—the militant Church faction burning heretics—has established a camp three days' march from Grannaria. They haven't attacked. They don't need to. They've simply positioned themselves to intercept grain shipments heading toward the Crown Lands.

Commander Ferrus of the Scouring has sent a simple message: "Provide for the faithful, and the faithful will provide for you."

**What This Means:**

- The Council must choose: pay tribute to the Scouring, or watch their trade routes strangled
- The Hierarchy in Vandgwyn is pressuring the Council to support the "legitimate" Church—meaning the corrupt bureaucrats, not the zealots
- Some Council members are considering playing both sides
- The common people just want to know if there will be bread this winter

**The Food Question:**

Beyond politics, there's a practical crisis. The Grainmarch's fields can still produce, but:
- Labor shortages mean less land is cultivated
- The canal network is deteriorating without proper maintenance
- Trade routes to other regions are unreliable
- The Reft infest abandoned farmland, making reclamation dangerous

The next bad harvest could tip the region from struggle into catastrophe.

## Atmosphere

**Sights:** Stone granaries rising like blunt towers against the flat horizon. Canal barges loaded with grain moving through the city. Windmills turning endlessly. Empty market stalls that once overflowed. Armed guards at every bridge and granary entrance.

**Sounds:** The grinding of mills. Water lapping against stone quays. Bargemen calling to each other across the water. Church bells marking the hours. The rustle of grain being measured and poured.

**Smells:** Grain dust everywhere—in your clothes, your food, your lungs. River water with its green organic tang. Fresh bread from the bakeries that still operate. The occasional rot-smell when the wind shifts from an abandoned district.

**The Feel:** A city holding its breath. People conduct business, maintain routines, but everyone knows it could all collapse. There's a brittle quality to the normalcy. Conversations stop when strangers approach. Everyone watches the granary towers, trying to judge how full they are.

# Part Two: Secondary Settlements

## 1. Molendinum (Mill-Town)

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Imperial Name** | Molendinum |
| **Local Name** | Mill-Town, The Grindstone |
| **Type** | Processing center |
| **Location** | 40 miles upstream on the Copia, where river gradient is ideal for water-mills |
| **Pre-Passing Population** | ~25,000 |
| **Post-Passing Population** | ~8,000 |
| **Current Authority** | Guild-Master Horatius Mola |

**Character:**

Where Grannaria stores grain, Molendinum grinds it. The town exists because of a quirk of geography—the Copia drops thirty feet over two miles here, providing perfect power for water-wheels. Dozens of mills line both banks, their wheels turning ceaselessly. The sound is omnipresent: the rumble and clatter of stone grinding stone.

Before the Passing, Molendinum processed a quarter of the Grainmarch's flour. Now it processes more—the surviving mills work constantly to compensate for those that have fallen silent elsewhere.

**Notable Feature: The Mill-Run**

A two-mile stretch of river with over forty operational mills on either bank. Engineers call it the most efficient concentration of water-power in the Empire. The mills are connected by wooden walkways, creating an elevated path along the river. At night, the Mill-Run is lit by the glow from grinding chambers—sparks from stone on stone.

**The Tension:**

Guild-Master Horatius has declared Molendinum "neutral territory"—supplying flour to whoever pays, regardless of politics. This has made him enemies among the Council (who want exclusive supply) and allies among those who fear Council monopoly. The Scouring has approached him privately; he hasn't said no.

---

## 2. Portus Copia (Abundance-Port)

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Imperial Name** | Portus Copia |
| **Local Name** | Copia-mouth, The Junction |
| **Type** | River port and transfer point |
| **Location** | Where the Copia River joins the canal network, 50 miles west of Grannaria |
| **Pre-Passing Population** | ~18,000 |
| **Post-Passing Population** | ~6,000 |
| **Current Authority** | Harbor-Mistress Valeria Ripas |

**Character:**

The transfer point where grain from the western plains meets the canal system. River barges too large for the canals unload here; smaller canal boats carry the cargo onward. Before the Passing, Portus Copia was a chaotic, prosperous place—warehouses bursting, taverns packed, dockworkers earning good wages.

Now it's quieter. The warehouses are half-empty. The dockworkers who survived take what work they can get. But the fundamental geography remains—if you want to move grain from west to east, you go through Portus Copia.

**Notable Feature: The Weighing Quays**

A series of platforms where cargo is transferred and weighed. Each platform has its own scales, its own officials, its own traditions. The oldest, the Emperor's Quay, uses brass scales supposedly gifted by an Emperor two centuries ago. Whether they're accurate is debated; what matters is that measurements from the Emperor's Quay are legally binding throughout the Empire.

**The Tension:**

Harbor-Mistress Valeria has a problem: she's loyal to the old Empire, but the old Empire doesn't exist anymore. She refuses to recognize the Council's authority but can't actually stop them from taxing cargo. Her compromise is to maintain "imperial standards" while passively resisting Council control—a position that satisfies no one and may not survive the winter.

---

## 3. Castrum Tritici (Wheat-Fort)

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Imperial Name** | Castrum Tritici |
| **Local Name** | Wheat-Fort, The Bastion |
| **Type** | Fortress and garrison town |
| **Location** | 70 miles south of Grannaria, guarding the southern approaches |
| **Pre-Passing Population** | ~12,000 |
| **Post-Passing Population** | ~5,000 (plus ~800 soldiers) |
| **Current Authority** | Prefect Marius Scutum |

**Character:**

The Grainmarch's primary military installation. Built a century ago when southern raiders threatened the harvest, Castrum Tritici was designed to hold a legion and protect grain transport. The fortress is practical rather than grand—thick walls, deep granaries, clean sight-lines. The surrounding town exists to serve the garrison.

Prefect Marius Scutum commands what's left of the Imperial forces in the region: 800 soldiers who still wear Imperial colors and follow Imperial discipline. They are the most organized military force in the Grainmarch—and everyone knows it.

**Notable Feature: The South Road**

The main road from the Grainmarch to the southern provinces passes through Castrum Tritici's gate. Before the Passing, a thousand wagons a day might pass. Now it's a trickle—but that trickle is the only reliable connection to Khaldera and the Dragon-kin territories.

**The Tension:**

Prefect Marius has received messages from three different claimants to Imperial authority, each demanding his loyalty. He's responded to none of them. His soldiers are loyal to him, not to distant capitals. He could march on Grannaria and probably take it. He could declare the Grainmarch an independent territory. Instead, he waits, maintains discipline, and keeps the South Road open—for now.

The question everyone asks: What is Marius waiting for?

---

## 4. Vicus Aquarum (Water-Village)

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Imperial Name** | Vicus Aquarum |
| **Local Name** | The Locks, Water-town |
| **Type** | Engineering settlement |
| **Location** | 30 miles north of Grannaria, at the main canal junction |
| **Pre-Passing Population** | ~8,000 |
| **Post-Passing Population** | ~3,500 |
| **Current Authority** | Lock-Master Tertius Clavis |

**Character:**

A town that exists because of engineering. This is where the main canal system branches—three major canals diverging toward different destinations. The locks here control water levels throughout the network. Without Vicus Aquarum, the canals don't function.

The Lock-Keepers are a hereditary guild, their skills passed through families. They understand the canal system in ways that books can't capture—the quirks, the pressure points, the seasonal variations. The Council knows that if the Lock-Keepers walked away, the Grainmarch's transport network would collapse within a month.

**Notable Feature: The Triple Lock**

The engineering marvel at the town's heart. Three separate lock chambers lifting barges from river level to the canal network—a thirty-foot rise accomplished through a series of gates and chambers. The machinery is ancient, the mechanisms worn, but the Lock-Keepers keep it functioning through expertise and constant repair.

**The Tension:**

Lock-Master Tertius is old and has no heir. His children died in the Passing; his apprentices were young and inexperienced. He's trying to train replacements faster than normally possible, knowing that if he dies before the knowledge transfers, the canal system may never recover. The Council has offered him anything—gold, titles, whatever he wants. He only wants time, and that's the one thing no one can give him.

# Part Three: Notable Sites

## 1. The Drowned Granary (Horreum Mersum)

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Type** | Ruin/Flooded structure |
| **Location** | 15 miles downstream from Grannaria, in a loop of the Vitaflumen |
| **History** | A granary complex that subsided and flooded two centuries ago |
| **Current State** | Partially submerged ruin; local legend claims treasure beneath |

**Background:**

The Horreum Mersum was once the largest granary complex in the Grainmarch—larger even than Grannaria's Twelve Giants. Then, during an unusually wet spring, the ground beneath it gave way. The building didn't collapse; it sank. Within a week, the lower floors were underwater. Within a month, only the roof showed above the surface.

The Empire investigated but concluded recovery wasn't worth the cost. The granary was abandoned, its contents left to rot (or so the official story goes).

**The Legends:**

Locals have always whispered that the Horreum Mersum contained more than grain. Some say the Governor of that era was hiding Imperial gold, skimmed from taxes. Others claim it held weapons—relics from the God-Giant War, too dangerous to display but too valuable to destroy. A few stories suggest the granary was deliberately sunk to hide something, though the stories disagree on what.

**Current State:**

The building's upper floors now rise from a small lake, surrounded by swamp. Local fishermen avoid it. Since the Passing, there have been reports of lights in the upper windows—impossible, since the interior is supposed to be flooded. A few treasure hunters have entered. Not all have returned.

**The Hook:**

The Council has quietly put out word that they'd pay well for a survey of the Drowned Granary's contents. They claim it's about recovering emergency grain reserves. Nobody believes that. What do they really want—and what's actually in there?

---

## 2. The Field of Blades (Campus Gladiorum)

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Type** | Ancient battlefield/Memorial |
| **Location** | 25 miles east of Grannaria, between the Vitaflumen and Tardus rivers |
| **History** | Site of a massive battle during the Empire's expansion |
| **Current State** | Memorial site; increasingly active Reft presence |

**Background:**

Eight centuries ago, the Empire conquered the Grainmarch. The conquest was not peaceful. At Campus Gladiorum, the Imperial legions met the combined forces of the native kingdoms—farmers, militia, anyone who could hold a weapon. The battle lasted three days. When it ended, the fields were covered with dead.

The Empire memorialized the site with stone markers—not for the locals who died defending their homes, but for the "glorious legions who brought civilization to the barbarians." Over centuries, the site accumulated monuments, a small chapel, and a tradition of pilgrimage by military families.

**The Legend:**

The Grainmarch was sacred to Kasandra (Life) before the conquest. The natives fought under green banners, calling on the goddess to protect the land's fertility. Some say the goddess heard—that the massive bloodshed at Campus Gladiorum created a permanent stain, a wound in the Life-field itself. The surrounding farmland has always been less productive than it should be.

**Current State:**

Since the Passing, the Field of Blades has become infested with Reft—specifically Growing Reft, covered in fungal blooms and plant matter. They don't wander; they stand among the monuments like an army on parade. Travelers report seeing them arranged in formation, as if waiting for orders.

**The Hook:**

A scholar from Lexium believes the Reft at Campus Gladiorum aren't random. He thinks the ancient dead are returning—that the Life-field wound and the Passing have combined to raise an army that was defeated eight centuries ago. If he's right, who are they waiting to fight?

---

## 3. The Blessed Mills (Molae Sacrae)

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Type** | Religious site (syncretic) |
| **Location** | 35 miles northwest of Grannaria, where a spring emerges from limestone |
| **History** | Pre-Imperial sacred site converted to Solarian use, but never quite tamed |
| **Current State** | Active pilgrimage site; tensions between Church and folk practitioners |

**Background:**

Before the Empire, before the Church, the spring at Molae Sacrae was sacred to Kasandra. The water was believed to bless fertility—of fields, of livestock, of women who drank it. When the Empire came, they built mills on the spring. When the Church came, they built a chapel and declared the spring's power came from "the Light's blessing through water."

Neither conversion was complete. The mills still turn. The chapel still stands. But locals still bring offerings to the spring—coins, flowers, small cakes—and pray in words older than Imperial Latin.

**The Site:**

Three mills powered by the spring's flow, grinding grain for surrounding villages. A modest Solarian chapel beside the water source. An ancient stone, worn smooth by centuries of touching hands, set into the chapel floor. The priests pretend not to notice when people kneel to touch it.

**Current State:**

Since the Passing, the Blessed Mills have become the center of a quiet religious conflict. The local priest, Father Severus, is a hardliner who wants to purge the "pagan remnants." The miller families, who've tended the site for generations, are pushing back. They've begun openly performing the old rites—Kasandran prayers, offerings to the spring, dances at the solstice. Neither side will back down.

**The Hook:**

Both sides have appealed for outside support. The priest has sent word to the Scouring. The millers have sent word to folk-practitioners in the Kingswood. If both messages are received, the Blessed Mills could become a flashpoint in a larger religious war.

---

## 4. The Silent Canal (Canalis Tacitus)

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Type** | Passing-Scar (anomaly) |
| **Location** | A 5-mile stretch of canal 20 miles west of Grannaria |
| **History** | Normal canal until the Passing |
| **Current State** | Profoundly strange; sound doesn't function properly within it |

**Background:**

During the Passing, something happened to this section of canal. No one knows exactly what—those who witnessed it didn't survive, or didn't remember. When survivors returned to assess the damage, they found the canal itself intact. The water still flows. Barges can still navigate. But sound... doesn't work.

**The Phenomenon:**

Within the Silent Canal, sounds are muted to near-inaudibility. Speaking requires shouting; shouting produces a whisper. Footsteps, machinery, even the splash of water—all reduced to ghostly murmurs. The silence isn't complete, but it's profound. Many who enter report headaches, disorientation, an overwhelming urge to leave.

The effect has sharp boundaries. One moment, normal sound; the next, the silence. The transition is disorienting enough that some bargemen have fallen into the water.

**Current State:**

The Silent Canal remains navigable, but bargemen hate it. They've developed rituals: stuffing their ears with wax, chanting prayers before entering, refusing to speak until they emerge. Some claim the silence is spreading—that the affected stretch is longer than it was a year ago. The Council hasn't confirmed this.

**The Hook:**

A Lock-Keeper's apprentice claims he heard something in the Silent Canal—a voice, speaking words he couldn't understand, coming from beneath the water. He's refused to work there since. But he marked the spot. Someone with the right equipment—or the right magic—might be able to find what's down there.

# Part Four: Key Figures

## 1. Quintus Severinus, Chairman of the Council

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Full Name** | Quintus Severinus Granus |
| **Age** | 67 |
| **Role** | Chairman of the Council of Merchants, de facto ruler of Grannaria |
| **Background** | Third-generation grain merchant; family has traded in Grannaria for a century |

**Character:**

Quintus remembers the old world. He was 60 when the Passing happened—old enough to know exactly what was lost, young enough to want to preserve what remains. He's a pragmatist, not an idealist. He doesn't believe the Empire will return, doesn't believe the Church will reform, doesn't believe anyone is coming to save the Grainmarch. He believes in keeping people fed.

He speaks quietly, dresses plainly, and radiates the patient authority of a man who's waited out many crises. His enemies assume he's weak. They're wrong. He's cautious, which is different.

**Goal:**

Quintus wants Grannaria to survive—not thrive, not expand, not conquer. Survive. If that means paying tribute to the Scouring, he'll pay. If it means executing grain thieves, he'll sign the warrants. If it means compromising with people he despises, he'll shake their hands. The next generation can worry about principles. His job is to make sure there is a next generation.

**Complication:**

Quintus is dying. He hasn't told anyone—a growth in his belly that the healers can't cure. He has perhaps a year, maybe two. His primary concern now is succession. The other Council members are capable administrators but lack his vision. If he dies without grooming a replacement, the Council will fracture, and everything he's built will collapse.

He's watching for someone who understands what survival actually requires.

---

## 2. Commander Ferrus of the Scouring

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Full Name** | Ferrus (birth name abandoned when he took vows) |
| **Age** | 43 |
| **Role** | Commander of the Scouring's Grainmarch detachment |
| **Background** | Former Inquisitor; rose through the ranks during the post-Passing chaos |

**Character:**

Ferrus is a true believer—but his belief is more sophisticated than it appears. He genuinely thinks the Passing was divine punishment for the Empire's corruption. He genuinely thinks purging heresy is necessary for salvation. But he's not stupid. He knows that burning villages doesn't win wars. He knows that starving populations breed rebellion. He knows that the Church needs the Grainmarch's food.

He's tall, gaunt, with burn scars on his hands from his Inquisitor days. He speaks of atrocities in the same calm tone he uses to discuss weather. Not because he enjoys cruelty, but because he's processed it all into theology. Everything serves the Light. Everything.

**Goal:**

Ferrus wants to bring the Grainmarch under Scouring control—not through conquest, which would destroy the productive capacity, but through leverage. Control the food, control the population. Once the Scouring feeds the region, the region will accept Scouring authority. Then the real work of purification can begin.

**Complication:**

Ferrus is under pressure from the Scouring's leadership to be more aggressive. They want burnings, not diplomacy. They want to make examples. Ferrus has been delaying, citing strategic necessity, but his superiors are growing impatient. If he can't deliver results soon—real results, not just positioning—he'll be replaced by someone less subtle. That someone will burn Grannaria, and Ferrus will be forced to watch the food supply he needs go up in flames.

---

## 3. The Dock-Mother (Mater Portus)

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Full Name** | Unknown (called "Lia" by those who knew her before) |
| **Age** | 35-40 (estimated) |
| **Role** | Leader of the Canal Quarter's informal power structure |
| **Background** | Former dockworker; rose to prominence after the Passing by organizing orphans and displaced workers |

**Character:**

No one elected the Dock-Mother. No one appointed her. She simply started doing what needed doing—feeding the orphans, organizing the workers, settling disputes—and people started coming to her instead of the Council. She operates from the Children's Quay, surrounded by the street children she's organized into an intelligence network, work crews, and (when necessary) a small army of pickpockets and runners.

She's small, plain-featured, with the calloused hands of someone who's worked barges. She speaks with the Canal Quarter's distinctive accent and uses profanity like punctuation. Nobles find her vulgar. Workers find her reassuring. The Council finds her terrifying.

**Goal:**

The Dock-Mother wants the workers of the Canal Quarter to have power—real power, not just wages. She's watched the Council get rich while the workers who make their wealth possible go hungry. She doesn't want revolution (she's seen what chaos costs), but she wants a seat at the table. She wants the Council to need her agreement before making decisions that affect the Quarter.

**Complication:**

Some of her followers want more. There's a faction in the Canal Quarter that talks about seizing the granaries, executing the merchants, establishing "worker rule." The Dock-Mother has kept them contained so far, but every Council misstep strengthens them. She's afraid that if she's too moderate, her own people will replace her with someone who isn't.

And she's noticed that Prefect Marius has been sending representatives to the Canal Quarter—not to her, but to the radical faction. She doesn't know what he's planning, but she knows it can't be good.

# Part Five: Local Conditions

## The Reft Situation

**Overall Assessment:** Moderate, with concentrated danger zones

The Grainmarch has fewer Reft than some regions—the flat terrain provides good visibility, and the canal network creates natural barriers. But "fewer" doesn't mean "few."

**Distribution:**

| Area | Reft Density | Types |
|------|--------------|-------|
| Cities and large towns | Very Low | Occasional infiltrators, quickly dealt with |
| Active farmland | Low | Seasonal incursions, managed by patrols |
| Abandoned farms | Moderate | Drifters and Sitters; dangerous to reclaim |
| Rural roads | Moderate-High | Seekers drawn to travelers |
| Flooded areas/marshes | High | Drowned Reft increasingly common |
| Field of Blades | Very High | Growing Reft in disturbing formations |

**Predominant Types:**

- **Growing Reft:** Most common, especially in abandoned agricultural areas. They stand in fields like crops, vegetation sprouting from their bodies.
- **Drowned Reft:** Emerging as a significant threat in waterlogged areas. They lurk beneath the surface of canals and flooded fields.
- **Root Reft:** Territorial, claiming specific locations and attacking anyone who enters. Often found in old farmhouses.

**Management:**

The Council pays bounties for Reft cleared from priority areas. Village militias patrol their immediate surroundings. But there aren't enough hands for systematic clearing. The abandoned outer ring of farmland has effectively been ceded to the Reft.

## Travel

**Primary Routes:**

| Route | Type | Condition | Notes |
|-------|------|-----------|-------|
| **Vitaflumen River** | Water | Good | Main artery; barge traffic monitored |
| **Copia River** | Water | Fair | Seasonal flooding; variable water levels |
| **Tardus River** | Water | Good | Slow but reliable; heavy cargo |
| **Main Canal Network** | Water | Good | Council-maintained; tolls at locks |
| **Secondary Canals** | Water | Variable | Some blocked; some unmaintained |
| **Via Frumentaria** | Road | Fair | Main road to Crown Lands; Scouring nearby |
| **South Road** | Road | Good | Maintained by Prefect Marius |
| **Local Roads** | Road | Poor | Unmaintained; Reft hazard |

**How People Travel:**

Water travel is preferred—safer, faster, and the canal boats can carry cargo. Road travel is dangerous and usually only undertaken by armed groups. Most farmers never leave their village's immediate area.

**The Scouring Blockade:**

The Scouring hasn't physically blocked the Via Frumentaria, but their camp is positioned to intercept any significant convoy. Small groups can slip past. Large shipments cannot. This is strangling trade to the Crown Lands.

## Trade

**What Flows Out:**

| Good | Destination | Volume | Control |
|------|-------------|--------|---------|
| Grain (wheat, barley) | Crown Lands, all regions | Reduced to 30% of pre-Passing | Council |
| Flour | Local and regional | Stable | Miller's Guild |
| Preserved foods | Wherever buyers exist | Increasing | Various |

**What Flows In:**

| Good | Source | Volume | Notes |
|------|--------|--------|-------|
| Worked metal | North (Axis Faith) | Severely reduced | Critical shortage |
| Cloth | West (Kingswood) | Reduced | Still arriving via river |
| Luxury goods | East (Portus Aureus) | Minimal | Nobody's buying luxuries |
| Soldiers/Mercenaries | Various | Increasing | Everyone wants protection |

**Trade Reality:**

The Grainmarch produces food but needs almost everything else. Before the Passing, this was fine—a prosperous agricultural region could trade for whatever it needed. Now, with trade routes disrupted and currency destabilized, the region is struggling. The Council has begun experimenting with barter economies: grain for metal, grain for cloth, grain for soldiers.

---

## Religion

**Official Practice:**

The Solarian Church maintains a presence—the Flood Temple in Grannaria, chapels in every town, priests in most villages. The Archprelate of Grannaria (technically subordinate to Vandgwyn) still holds services, blesses harvests, performs the Sacraments.

**Reality:**

The Church's authority is hollow. After the Passing, people saw that the Light didn't protect them. The Archprelate's sermons about "testing faith" ring increasingly empty. Attendance has dropped. Donations have dried up. The priests who remain are often the genuinely devout—those who stayed to help, not to rule.

**What's Actually Practiced:**

- **Folk Alysian traditions:** Offerings to field spirits, seasonal observances, prayers at standing stones. Openly practiced in rural areas; quietly in cities.
- **Kasandran fertility rites:** "Blessing the fields" ceremonies that the Church pretends not to notice. Essential for farmer morale.
- **Ostaran ancestor veneration:** Particularly strong since the Passing. People want to believe their dead are somewhere.
- **The Scouring's version:** In areas they control, harsh Solarian fundamentalism enforced through violence.

**The Coming Conflict:**

The Blessed Mills situation is a microcosm of a regional tension. Folk practitioners are becoming bolder. The Church hardliners are becoming more desperate. The moderate priests are caught in the middle. Something will break.

## The Scars

**Known Passing-Wounds in the Grainmarch:**

| Scar | Type | Location | Effect |
|------|------|----------|--------|
| **The Silent Canal** | Sound-dead zone | West of Grannaria | Sound doesn't propagate normally |
| **The Glass Field** | Fused earth | Near Castrum Tritici | A field where lightning struck during the Passing; ground fused to glass; nothing grows |
| **The Wrong-Water Stretch** | Water anomaly | Upper Copia | Water flows uphill for about a mile; no explanation |
| **The Grey Farms** | Color-drained zone | Northeast | Color has faded from several square miles; crops still grow but are tasteless |

**Pattern:**

The Grainmarch's Scars tend to be subtle rather than dramatic—zones where reality is slightly wrong rather than catastrophically broken. This matches the region's character: practical, agricultural, concerned with gradual processes rather than sudden violence.

# Part Six: Adventure Hooks

## 1. The Granary That Breathes

**Setup:** The sealed granary called Caligulus has been closed since the Passing after workers reported hearing sounds from within. The Council has quietly decided to open it—they need the storage space. They're hiring outsiders for the job, not wanting to risk their own people.

**What's Inside:** The sounds were real. During the Passing, a group of workers sought shelter in Caligulus. They survived—but they've been changed. They've been living on the grain stores, but the grain has done something to them. They're not quite Reft, not quite human. They've been singing to keep themselves sane, and their song has begun affecting the grain itself.

**The Complication:** The changed workers could potentially be saved—or they could be the source of a new kind of Reft infestation. The Council wants the granary cleared and usable. A Kasandran priestess (hiding in the city) believes the workers have accidentally created something sacred. The choice of what to do with them could have consequences for the entire region.

---

## 2. The Lock-Master's Legacy

**Setup:** Lock-Master Tertius Clavis is dying and knows it. He's put out a quiet call for anyone who might have the aptitude to learn the lock-keeping arts—anyone at all, regardless of background. The Council is nervous about who might answer.

**What's Happening:** Tertius has realized something: the canal system contains secrets that go beyond engineering. The original builders incorporated what he believes are Axis Faith rune-workings into the lock mechanisms—magical elements that keep the system functioning in ways that pure mechanics can't explain. If those secrets are lost, the canals will fail within a generation.

**The Complication:** Tertius needs apprentices who can understand both the engineering and the magic. The Council wants to control who learns these secrets. The Axis Faith (represented by dwarven observers) believes the runes are theirs by right and shouldn't be taught to surface-dwellers. And someone—possibly the Scouring, possibly someone else—has been sabotaging potential apprentices before they can reach Tertius.

## 3. The Bargemen's Strike

**Setup:** The Dock-Mother's moderate faction is losing ground to radicals. A work stoppage is being planned—not just a strike, but a complete shutdown of canal transport. If it happens, Grannaria starves in weeks.

**What's Really Happening:** The radical faction is being manipulated. Prefect Marius has been feeding them weapons, supplies, and encouragement through intermediaries. He wants the strike to happen because it will give him justification to march on Grannaria and "restore order." The Dock-Mother suspects something but can't prove it.

**The Complication:** Stopping the strike means either finding Marius's connection to the radicals (dangerous), helping the Dock-Mother outmaneuver her own people (risky), or helping the Council make enough concessions to defuse the situation (expensive and politically difficult). Meanwhile, the Scouring is watching—a destabilized Grannaria might be easier to absorb.

---

## 4. What Lies Beneath the Drowned Granary

**Setup:** The Council has hired a salvage team to explore the Drowned Granary. They went in three days ago. They haven't come out. The Council is hiring a second team—and this time, they're willing to pay for competence.

**What's Down There:** The Drowned Granary does contain treasure, but not gold. The Governor who built it was secretly a devotee of Atargatis (the Sea/Depths realm). The lower levels contain a temple to the Water-Sister, including a sacred pool that connects to the underground river system—and through it, potentially, to the deeper Undersea Realm.

**The Complication:** The first salvage team didn't die. They found the temple—and something in the sacred pool pulled them through. They're alive, somewhere in the Undersea, with no way home. A rescue is theoretically possible, but it would mean going into the water, following the connection, and navigating a realm that most surface-dwellers don't believe exists. Also, the Council definitely doesn't want news of a "pagan temple" in their territory getting out.

---

## 5. The Scouring's Offer

**Setup:** Commander Ferrus has made the Council an offer: formal tribute in exchange for protection and guaranteed trade access. The Council is debating. They've invited representatives to witness the negotiations—potentially including the player characters.

**What Ferrus Actually Wants:** Ferrus needs a win. His position is precarious. He's offering favorable terms because he needs this deal more than the Council knows. If the negotiations drag out too long, his superiors will replace him, and the new commander will simply attack.

**The Complication:** The negotiations are being sabotaged—but by whom? The Dock-Mother wants them to fail (she'd rather fight than submit). The hardline Council members want them to fail (they'd rather pay more tribute than any). Even Ferrus's own lieutenants might be sabotaging them (to prove he's too soft and should be replaced). Figuring out who's trying to wreck the peace—and whether peace is even the right outcome—could determine the region's future.
