# Azurea: High Marches (Fjallmark)
## Sub-Region Development Document

---

# Overview

**Region:** North (Provincia Borealis / Norðmark)
**Sub-Region:** High Marches
**Imperial Name:** Regio Montana
**Local Name:** Fjallmark ("Mountain-Mark")
**Capital:** Nordgard
**City Density:** Low (1 major city per ~200 miles)

**Character:** The Axis Mountains proper—a sacred landscape where the powers of Above and Below meet in precarious balance. Before the Passing, this was the spiritual heart of the Axis Faith, where Delvers from the deep forges and Surveyors from the cloud-cities gathered to worship at the Meeting Temple of Skyhallow. The mountains themselves are holy: every peak a channel for storm-power, every mine-shaft a conduit for stone-power, every pass a threshold where transformation occurs.

The Passing devastated the High Marches more thoroughly than anywhere else in the North. The Surveyor peoples—the Aetherwings, Nephilim, and Sythkarai—lived primarily above the clouds, in silk-spired cities and storm-woven platforms. When the eldritch creatures passed through, they passed *through*—literally, through the cloud-cities, which offered no more resistance than morning mist. Thousands fell. The surviving Surveyors are traumatized, grounded, their purpose shattered along with their homes.

Below ground, the Delver peoples—the Korvathrim, Mukir, and Kobalthari—survived largely intact. Their cities were too deep for the Passing to touch directly. But they have retreated, sealing gates, reducing contact with the surface, uncertain whether to emerge or wait out whatever comes next.

Between these broken heights and sealed depths, the human settlements of the High Marches struggle to survive. Cut off from the dwarven trade that sustained them, surrounded by mountain Reft who congregate in the high passes, they cling to fortress-towns built for a world that no longer exists.

# 1. The Capital City: Nordgard

## Names and Identity

**Imperial Name:** Castellum Boreale ("Northern Fortress")
**Local Name:** Nordgard ("North-Watch")
**Common Names:** The Gateway, the Last Warm Hall, the Stone Hearth

## Location

Nordgard sits at the northern terminus of the Via Montana where the Imperial road finally surrenders to the mountains. Built at the confluence of two glacier-fed rivers—the Iskjarna (Ice-Cold) and the Steinvann (Stone-Water)—the city occupies a broad valley floor beneath the first major peaks of the Axis range.

The location was chosen millennia ago for practical reasons: it's the last flat ground wide enough for a proper market before the passes begin. Dwarven engineers later improved it, carving terraces into the valley walls and installing the geothermal heating system that makes winter survival possible.

To the south, the Via Montana descends through foothills toward the Imperial heartland. To the north, the Thrymweg (Giant's Road) climbs toward the high passes and eventually reaches the ruins of Skyhallow. To the east and west, the valley walls rise sharply toward the Axis peaks.

## Scale

**Pre-Passing Population:** ~45,000 (approximately half human, half dwarven)
**Post-Passing Population:** ~30,000 (mostly human; dwarves withdrawn to Thrymheim)

The population drop reflects not deaths but departures. When the Passing came, the dwarven community—some 20,000 strong—retreated to Thrymheim within days. They had always maintained homes in both places; when the world broke, they chose the safety of the deep halls. A few hundred remain in Nordgard, maintaining the heating systems and serving as unofficial liaisons, but the Dwarven Quarter feels like a ghost town.

## Districts

### The Marktplatz (Market-Square District)

The commercial heart of Nordgard, built around an enormous open square where Axis Faith doctrine holds that fair exchange is sacred worship. Before the Passing, the Marktplatz hosted traders from across the Empire—southern silks, eastern spices, western timber, and most importantly, dwarven metalwork from the deep forges.

**Character:** Wide flagstone streets, heavy timber-and-stone buildings, covered galleries protecting merchants from weather. The architecture is pragmatic rather than beautiful—everything built to withstand wind, snow, and the occasional rockslide. Shop-signs are worked in iron rather than painted wood (paint doesn't survive the winters). The great Weigh-House at the square's center once employed fifty weighmasters; now three suffice.

**Current State:** Trade has collapsed but not ended. Local goods still change hands—preserved meat, wool, leather, the mountain herbs that make Nordgard's famous throat-soothing tea. What's missing is everything that came from the dwarves: weapons, tools, heating-stones, the clever mechanisms that made northern life bearable. The market feels half-empty even when crowded.

### The Steinheim (Stone-Home District)

The Dwarven Quarter, built into the eastern valley wall. Unlike the human districts on the valley floor, Steinheim is carved into living rock—a three-dimensional neighborhood of tunnels, chambers, and balconies that was never meant to house humans and still doesn't quite accommodate them.

**Character:** The architecture is pure Delver aesthetic: angular, efficient, decorated with geometric patterns that seem abstract until you realize they're stylized representations of crystalline structures. Every corridor is precisely level; every stairway conforms to dwarven ergonomics (wider and shallower than human stairs). Heating vents carved like forge-mouths emit constant warmth from geothermal sources below.

**Current State:** Mostly empty. Perhaps 300 dwarves remain, down from 20,000. They cluster near the Forge-Gate that leads to the deep road toward Thrymheim, maintaining the heating systems that benefit everyone and staffing the few essential services they're obligated to provide under ancient treaties. The empty halls have been claimed by human squatters—refugees, the desperate, and a few enterprising souls who've realized the heating works whether or not dwarves are present.

### The Fyrstheim (Lord's-Home District)

The administrative and aristocratic quarter, occupying the highest ground on the valley floor where sight-lines are best and defensive walls are thickest. Here stands the Jarl's Hall where Nordgard's rulers have governed for centuries, and the smaller but still impressive manors of the noble families who made their fortunes in the mountain trade.

**Character:** Stone foundations, timber upper floors, steeply pitched roofs designed to shed snow. The buildings are larger and better-maintained than elsewhere, with glass windows (a luxury this far north) and private wells. The streets are cobbled rather than flagstoned, drained properly, patrolled regularly. Guard-towers at each corner provide watch-points and archery positions.

**Current State:** Duke Bjorn Wolf-Friend rules from the Jarl's Hall, maintaining order through a combination of personal authority, careful rationing, and the loyalty of his household warriors. The noble manors are mostly occupied—their owners have nowhere better to go—but the wealth that built them has dried up. Some families have begun selling furnishings to buy food.

### The Vindgata (Wind-Street District)

The common quarter, sprawling across the western valley floor where the wind off the peaks is coldest and the rents were always cheapest. Home to laborers, craftsmen, servants, and everyone else who made Nordgard function without ever appearing in its histories.

**Character:** Crowded timber buildings, narrow streets that were never planned but grew organically, shared wells and communting baking-ovens. The architecture shows influence from a dozen traditions—Imperial timber-frame next to Axis stone-foundation next to northern log-cabin. Every building has been modified, expanded, subdivided, and modified again over generations.

**Current State:** Overcrowded despite population loss. Refugees from the mountain settlements—places too small to defend themselves—have crowded into Vindgata, sleeping six to a room, competing for work that doesn't exist. The district's traditional inhabitants resent the newcomers; the newcomers resent everyone. Duke Bjorn's guards patrol here more heavily than anywhere else.

### The Heilagstað (Holy-Place District)

The religious quarter, originally dedicated entirely to Axis Faith temples and now awkwardly shared with Solarian Church institutions. The two traditions have never been fully compatible—the Axis Faith sees power as neutral, to be channeled through exchange and transformation; the Church sees Light as inherently good and darkness as inherently evil. Their temples sit side by side in mutual incomprehension.

**Character:** The Axis Faith temple is called the Møteplass (Meeting-Place), built half above and half below ground to honor the synthesis of powers. Its entrance is a massive arch carved with interlocking storm-and-stone motifs; inside, the main hall features a floor of polished obsidian and a ceiling of suspended silk (now tattered) that once moved with artificial wind. The Solarian church—St. Magnus of the Mountains—is a conventional Imperial structure, all vertical aspiration and narrow windows, looking distinctly uncomfortable among its neighbors.

**Current State:** The Møteplass functions but feels hollow. The High Priest died in the Passing; no replacement has been confirmed. The rituals continue, led by lesser clergy, but everyone knows they're incomplete—the Surveyor priests who once descended from above are gone, and the Delver priests who once ascended from below no longer come. St. Magnus's congregation has actually grown; frightened people turn to familiar comforts.

## Landmarks

### The Forge-Gate (Smiðjuhlið)

The great gate connecting Nordgard to the deep road that leads to Thrymheim. Carved into the eastern cliff-face, forty feet high and thirty wide, worked in bronze and iron with scenes depicting the Great Circuit—ore ascending to be transformed, artifacts descending to serve. The gate has never been closed in living memory; it is now closed, sealed from within.

**Significance:** The closed gate is Nordgard's greatest wound. It represents not just lost trade but lost trust—the dwarves retreating, the ancient partnership broken. Duke Bjorn visits the gate every seventh day to knock and speak through the speaking-tube, maintaining the forms of diplomacy. Sometimes someone answers. Usually not.

### The Aurora-Tower (Ljósturn)

The tallest structure in Nordgard, built to observe the Northern Lights which the Axis Faith considers messages from the powers Above. The tower rises 200 feet from the valley floor, its upper levels designed by Surveyor architects with Sythkarai silk and Aetherwing guidance. From its observatory, priests once read the aurora's patterns to predict weather, divine omens, and guide the timing of rituals.

**Current State:** The silk portions of the upper levels were shredded in the Passing. A traumatized Aetherwing named Silence-After-Thunder has taken up residence in what remains, spending her days staring at the sky and her nights screaming. The lower levels are still used for weather observation, but no one remembers how to read the aurora properly.

### The Warm Springs (Heitir Keldar)

Natural hot springs at the valley's western edge, sacred since before human settlement. The water emerges at near-boiling temperature from deep volcanic sources, filling a series of pools that have been improved with stone channeling over millennia. The springs are the source of Nordgard's geothermal heating—dwarven engineering channels the heat throughout the city.

**Significance:** The springs are one of the few things working correctly. People gather here to bathe, to warm themselves, to remember that some comforts remain. The steam rising from the pools is visible for miles, a beacon declaring that Nordgard still lives.

### The Thrym-Stone (Þrymsteinn)

A standing stone thirty feet high at the northern edge of the city, marking the beginning of the Thrymweg road to the high passes. According to legend, it's a tooth from the giant Thrym, dropped when he was slain in the God-Giant War. According to Axis Faith doctrine, it's a natural formation that channels power between above and below. According to geological survey, it's an unusual mineral composition that defies easy classification.

**Significance:** The stone hums. Not loudly—you have to press your ear against it—but constantly, a bass vibration that some find comforting and others find deeply unsettling. Since the Passing, the hum has changed pitch slightly. No one knows what this means.

### The Stranger's Hall (Framandahöll)

A large inn and assembly-hall near the Marktplatz, traditionally used to house visiting merchants and diplomats. The name refers to its neutrality—within its walls, all feuds are suspended, all debts temporarily forgiven, all travelers guaranteed safety regardless of origin.

**Current State:** Now serves as a combination refugee shelter, town hall, and emergency hospital. The neutrality tradition has been strained—fights break out, old grudges surface—but hasn't broken entirely. Matron Gudrun Ash-Hair maintains order through sheer force of personality.

## Atmosphere

**What You See:** Gray stone, gray sky, gray-green moss on every surface. Buildings hunched against the wind, streets empty except when necessary. Smoke rising from a thousand chimneys, mixing with steam from the hot springs into a perpetual haze. The mountains looming above, their peaks lost in clouds that might be weather or might be the remnants of fallen cloud-cities.

**What You Hear:** Wind. Always wind, funneled down the valley, whistling through every gap and doorway. The distant thunder of avalanches in spring. The hammering of smiths working with whatever metal they can scavenge. The prayers from St. Magnus, thin and reedy. The deeper chanting from the Møteplass, half-hearted and incomplete.

**What You Smell:** Woodsmoke and hot springs sulfur, wool and tallow, the herbal sharpness of mountain tea. Underneath it all, the wet-stone smell of snow that never entirely melts.

**What You Feel:** Cold, even in summer. The warmth from the heating vents is a constant blessing, but step away from a vent and the temperature drops noticeably. People move quickly between warm spaces, don't linger outdoors, layer their clothing even indoors.

## Who Rules

**Official Authority:** Duke Bjorn Wolf-Friend, hereditary ruler of the High Marches under Imperial charter. His family has governed Nordgard for twelve generations, maintaining the complex relationships between humans, dwarves, and Axis Faith institutions that made the region function.

**Actual Authority:** Duke Bjorn maintains genuine control, one of the few pre-Passing authorities who has neither fled nor been overthrown. His success stems from several factors: personal popularity (he's seen as fair and competent), military strength (his household guard remains intact and loyal), and essential utility (he understands the heating systems and maintains relationships with the remaining dwarves).

**Competing Powers:**
- **High Priest Vacant** — The Axis Faith hierarchy has not confirmed a new High Priest since the Passing. This creates a vacuum; various clergy claim authority; the rituals continue but decisions don't get made.
- **Father Ingmar of St. Magnus** — The Solarian priest has seen his congregation swell with frightened converts. He's careful not to challenge Duke Bjorn directly but positions himself as a moral authority.
- **The Thrymheim Council** — The dwarves behind the closed gate still influence Nordgard through the heating systems and occasional communication. They haven't abandoned the city entirely; they're waiting to see what happens.

## The Tension

**The Central Conflict:** Nordgard is dying slowly. Not from violence, not from plague, but from the collapse of everything that made it viable. The city existed to facilitate trade between the surface and the deep, between the Empire and the Axis nations. That trade has stopped. Without it, Nordgard is just a very cold valley with not enough farmland to feed its people.

**The Immediate Crisis:** Food will run out before next winter. Duke Bjorn knows this; everyone who can count knows this. The question is what to do about it. Options include:
- Convince the dwarves to resume trade (unlikely; they have their own problems)
- Convince refugees to leave (and go where?)
- Send expeditions to gather supplies from abandoned settlements (dangerous; Reft in the passes)
- Ration more strictly (already doing this)
- Accept that many will starve (unspoken but understood)

**The Underlying Question:** Does Nordgard have a future? Is it worth saving, or should the survivors accept that the city is finished and disperse to places with better prospects? Duke Bjorn refuses to consider abandonment, but his advisors whisper that stubbornness isn't leadership.

# 2. Secondary Settlements

## Eisenpass (Iron-Pass)

**Imperial Name:** Porta Ferrata
**Local Name:** Eisenpass
**Type:** Fortress-town controlling major mountain pass
**Population:** Pre-Passing ~3,500 / Post-Passing ~1,800

**Character:** A vertical fortress built into both sides of the narrowest point in the Nordgard Pass, connected by a stone bridge that can be destroyed in hours if needed. The town exists entirely to control access through the pass—every building doubles as a defensive position, every street is designed for ambush. The permanent garrison was always larger than the civilian population.

The architecture is pure military pragmatism: thick walls, narrow windows, interconnected structures that allow defenders to retreat through multiple buildings without exposing themselves. The famous Iron Gates—massive barriers of dwarven-forged metal—can seal the pass entirely.

**Notable Feature:** The Toll-House, where for centuries every merchant paid passage fees that funded the fortress garrison. The toll records, preserved in stone tablets, constitute an accidental economic history of the Axis trade. They end abruptly in the month of the Passing.

**Current State:** The garrison holds the pass but has little to hold it against. Refugees passed through in both directions in the early days after the Passing; now traffic has dwindled to almost nothing. Commander Ragnhild Stormhelm maintains military discipline because she knows nothing else, running drills and patrols against threats that don't materialize. The fortress is provisioned for years—mountain fortresses always are—but the soldiers' purpose has evaporated.

---

## Gullgryfja (Gold-Pit)

**Imperial Name:** Aurifodina Superior
**Local Name:** Gullgryfja
**Type:** Mining settlement with surface facilities
**Population:** Pre-Passing ~2,200 / Post-Passing ~400

**Character:** A mining town built above one of the few gold deposits that humans rather than dwarves exploited. The arrangement was ancient and complex: humans worked the surface dig, extracting ore that was then sold to dwarven refiners below; the dwarves received raw material, the humans received refined gold and tools. Neither side could operate independently.

The town clings to a mountainside on terraces carved from living rock. Buildings are partially dug into the slope for stability and warmth. The mine entrance dominates the upper terrace, marked by a carved arch depicting the exchange that defined the settlement.

**Notable Feature:** The Assay House, where Imperial assessors once verified gold quality and collected the Emperor's share. The assessment scales are still there—magnificent dwarven precision instruments—but the assessors fled south years ago.

**Current State:** The mine is closed. Without dwarven refiners, the raw ore is worthless—human smiths lack the techniques to process it. The remaining population survives on stockpiled food and desperate hope that trade will resume. Some have suggested mining anyway, stockpiling ore against future demand; others point out that no one can pay miners when there's no economy.

---

## Himmelsfot (Heaven's-Foot)

**Imperial Name:** Pes Caeli
**Local Name:** Himmelsfot
**Type:** Pilgrimage waystation
**Population:** Pre-Passing ~1,500 / Post-Passing ~600

**Character:** The traditional first stop on the pilgrimage route to Skyhallow, positioned at the base of the final ascent to the holy city. Himmelsfot was never meant to be a permanent settlement—just a place where pilgrims rested, purchased supplies, and received final blessings before the sacred climb. But permanence accumulates: inns became establishments, seasonal markets became year-round, and a waystation became a town.

The town is built around the Ascension Square, where pilgrims traditionally gathered before dawn to begin the climb. Stone steps lead upward from the square, the first of ten thousand that once carried the faithful to Skyhallow. The steps are carved with prayers in seventeen languages.

**Notable Feature:** The Last Warm Inn, a sprawling complex that could house hundreds of pilgrims simultaneously. Its great hall features a fireplace the size of a small house, kept burning through the harshest winters with wood hauled from the Pinelands.

**Current State:** No pilgrims come to Skyhallow anymore—there's nothing there to visit. Himmelsfot has lost its purpose entirely. The remaining population includes former inn-keepers with no guests, former guides with no one to guide, and a few hundred refugees who ended up here and couldn't face leaving. The stone steps still ascend, but no one climbs them. The Last Warm Inn stands empty, its great fireplace cold.

---

## Vaktborg (Watch-Fort)

**Imperial Name:** Castrum Vigilae
**Local Name:** Vaktborg
**Type:** Military outpost and signal station
**Population:** Pre-Passing ~800 / Post-Passing ~500

**Character:** A classic northern watchtower complex, built on a peak with sight-lines in every direction. The main tower rises eighty feet; on clear days, its signal fires can be seen from Nordgard to the south and from three other watchtowers in the chain. The military purpose was simple: warn of invasion. The practical function was also simple: guide travelers through passes that become deadly in poor weather.

The complex includes the tower itself, barracks for the garrison, a small Axis Faith shrine, and storehouses packed with emergency supplies. Everything is built from local stone, mortared with techniques the dwarves taught centuries ago.

**Notable Feature:** The Mirror Room at the tower's peak, containing precision-ground reflectors that can send coded messages by sunlight during the day and focused firelight at night. The mirror system was a Kobalthari creation; no one left alive fully understands how to maintain it.

**Current State:** Vaktborg still functions as a watchtower—Warden Sven Brightfire takes his responsibilities seriously—but the signal network is broken. Two of the three connecting towers have been abandoned; the third responds only intermittently. Vaktborg sees threats approaching but cannot warn anyone, sends messages that no one receives. The Warden keeps detailed logs anyway, recording everything he observes, trusting that someone will eventually read them.

# 3. Notable Sites

## The Ruins of Skyhallow (Himmelheim)

**Type:** Ruined holy city
**Location:** High plateau, three days' climb from Himmelsfot

**History:** Skyhallow was the holiest site of the Axis Faith—the Meeting Point made manifest, where Delvers from below and Surveyors from above came together to worship and exchange. For two thousand years, the city embodied the faith's central teaching: that power flows between above and below, and that the meeting point is sacred.

The city was built in three zones. The Deep Zone extended below the plateau into carved chambers and geothermal-heated halls; this was Delver territory, home to Korvathrim smiths and Mukir administrators and Kobalthari ritualists. The High Zone rose above the plateau on Sythkarai silk-spires and Nephilim cloud-bridges, suspended by arts that defied easy understanding; this was Surveyor territory, home to Aetherwing seers and Nephilim priests and the delicate mechanisms that maintained the impossible architecture. The Meeting Zone occupied the plateau surface, containing the great Meeting Temple where both peoples gathered.

**What Happened:** The Passing destroyed the High Zone entirely. The eldritch creatures passed through the silk-spires and cloud-bridges without slowing, and everything held aloft by Surveyor arts fell. The collapse killed thousands instantly; thousands more died in the following days from exposure, injury, and the complete breakdown of the city's systems. The Deep Zone survived but was sealed from within; the Delvers who sheltered there have not emerged.

**Current State:** The plateau is a graveyard. The Meeting Temple stands intact but purposeless—half its congregation dead, the other half sealed away. Debris from the High Zone litters the slopes for miles around: twisted silk-metal, shattered platforms, objects whose function can no longer be guessed. Among the ruins, traumatized Aetherwings wander aimlessly, unable to return to skies that betrayed them, unable to adapt to ground they were never built for.

**The Hook:** The sealed Deep Zone may contain survivors, knowledge, artifacts, or answers. Someone with the right connections—or enough determination—might convince the Delvers to unseal their doors. Alternatively, the ruins of the High Zone might contain Surveyor technologies that could help other peoples: weather-prediction devices, communication systems, the secrets of their impossible architecture.

## The Thrymheim Gate-Road (Þrymheimsvegr)

**Type:** Deep road (dwarven highway)
**Location:** Begins at Nordgard's Forge-Gate, extends deep into the mountains

**History:** The Thrymheim Gate-Road is one of the great achievements of Delver engineering: a perfectly level highway carved through miles of living rock, connecting the surface at Nordgard to the deep city of Thrymheim. The road is wide enough for wagon traffic, lit by glowing cobalt-veined stone, warmed by geothermal vents, and protected by defensive positions at regular intervals.

Before the Passing, the Gate-Road was the commercial artery connecting Imperial trade to dwarven production. Merchants descended with raw materials and surface goods; they ascended with dwarven metalwork, stonecraft, and the precision instruments that commanded premium prices throughout the Empire.

**Current State:** The road is closed. The Forge-Gate in Nordgard has been sealed from within; the corresponding gate at Thrymheim is presumably sealed as well. The dwarves have not abandoned the road—maintenance continues, the lights still glow, heat still flows—but they have restricted access to their own kind.

**The Hook:** Someone needs to convince the dwarves to reopen trade. Duke Bjorn has tried diplomacy; it's not working. Other approaches might include:
- Discovering what the dwarves actually want (beyond "safety")
- Finding an alternative route into Thrymheim
- Locating something valuable enough to make the dwarves reconsider
- Understanding what the dwarves learned during the Passing that made them close the gates

## The Weeping Glacier (Grátandi Jökull)

**Type:** Geographic/supernatural phenomenon
**Location:** High in the Axis range, above the Nordgard valley

**History:** A massive glacier that has always behaved strangely. Its melt-rate varies independently of temperature; sometimes it advances in summer, retreats in winter. The Axis Faith considered it sacred—a manifestation of the powers Above responding to forces Below. Pilgrims once climbed to its face to leave offerings and receive visions.

**Current State:** Since the Passing, the glacier has been "weeping"—producing far more meltwater than its size should allow, feeding the rivers below with flow that should have exhausted the ice long ago. The water has unusual properties: it's slightly warmer than it should be, slightly more mineral-rich, and those who drink it report strange dreams.

**The Hook:** Something is happening inside the glacier. The unusual melt, the dream-water, the sense that the ice is alive somehow—all point to something weird and potentially important. Expedition parties have entered crevasses in the glacier's face and not returned. Those who turned back reported hearing voices in languages no one speaks anymore.

---

## The Fallen Observatory (Fallinn Stjörnuhöll)

**Type:** Crash site / ruins
**Location:** Valley floor, three miles northwest of Nordgard

**History:** When Skyhallow fell, debris scattered across hundreds of square miles. One of the largest intact pieces was the Star-Hall—a Surveyor observatory where Aetherwings read astronomical patterns. The massive platform, perhaps two hundred feet across, somehow survived the fall relatively intact, embedding itself in a valley meadow like a coin dropped on mud.

**Current State:** The Star-Hall lies tilted but recognizable, its silk-metal hull corroded but unbreached. The instruments inside—precision optics, star-charts, devices for tracking celestial movements—are presumably still present. Local people avoid the site; they say lights move inside at night, and sometimes the whole structure hums like a struck bell.

**The Hook:** The observatory might contain star-charts showing the eldritch creatures' origin or trajectory—where they came from, where they went, whether they might return. The Aetherwing Silence-After-Thunder, who lives in Nordgard's Aurora-Tower, might be convinced to investigate if someone could break through her trauma. Alternatively, the instruments might have military or commercial value if salvaged intact.

---

## The Giants' Stair (Risatrappa)

**Type:** Ancient ruins / geographic feature
**Location:** Mountain pass east of Nordgard

**History:** A natural rock formation that resembles a staircase carved for beings thirty feet tall—each "step" roughly four feet high and eight feet deep. According to legend, the Giants' Stair was exactly that: steps carved by giants during the God-Giant War, leading from the lowlands to the peaks where they made their last stand.

According to more sober geological analysis, the formation is natural: a consequence of the mountain's unusual stratified composition eroding at different rates. But the strata are remarkably regular, and the "steps" remarkably consistent, for a purely natural phenomenon.

**Current State:** The Giants' Stair has become a concentration point for Storm Reft—the Passing-touched who crackle with uncontrolled electrical energy. They gather on the steps, dozens of them, standing motionless for days and then suddenly exploding into violent motion. The local theory is that something about the formation attracts the Peaks-field energy that animates them.

**The Hook:** The Storm Reft congregation is a threat—if they move toward Nordgard, they'll be devastating—but also an opportunity. Someone who understood why they gather here might learn something about the Reft in general. And the Giants' Stair itself may conceal something: a passage, a relic, an answer to questions no one has thought to ask.

# 4. Key Figures

## Duke Bjorn Wolf-Friend

**Full Name and Titles:** Bjorn Hardrada, Duke of the High Marches, Protector of Nordgard, Friend to Thrymheim, Wolf-Friend
**Role:** Hereditary ruler of the High Marches

**Character:** A barrel-chested man in his early fifties with a silver-streaked beard and the careful eyes of someone who survives by thinking three moves ahead. Bjorn earned his epithet "Wolf-Friend" in his youth when he allegedly tamed a wolf-pack through patience and raw meat; the truth is more complicated, but the image stuck. He rules through consensus-building rather than force, remembering every name, honoring every obligation, treating the lowest servant's concerns as seriously as any noble's.

**What He Wants:** To save his city. To maintain order until order becomes possible again. To reopen the Forge-Gate and restore the dwarven trade that made Nordgard viable. He would sacrifice almost anything to achieve these goals—his comfort, his wealth, his reputation, possibly his life. But he won't sacrifice his people's trust, which limits his options.

**The Complication:** Bjorn is a man built for the world that existed, not the world that exists now. His skills—diplomacy, patience, incremental progress—work poorly against an apocalypse. He keeps trying to negotiate when negotiation doesn't help, keeps building consensus when decisive action might be needed. His greatest strength is also his greatest limitation: he cannot bring himself to abandon anyone.

---

## High Priestess-Claimant Solveig the Unlucky

**Full Name and Titles:** Solveig Kolsdottir, Claimant to the High Priesthood of the Meeting Temple, Speaker of the Lower Voices
**Role:** Highest-ranking Axis Faith clergy still active in Nordgard

**Character:** A woman in her sixties, gaunt from fasting and grief, dressed in robes that combine Delver stone-grey with Surveyor silk-white (the silk sections now tattered and patched). Solveig was never supposed to lead—she was a scholar-priestess, specializing in the historical interpretation of temple records. But everyone senior to her died at Skyhallow, and she has emerged as the de facto religious authority by default rather than calling.

She knows she's not qualified for this. She says so regularly. But no one else has stepped forward, and the rituals must continue.

**What She Wants:** Validation. She needs the Thrymheim dwarves to confirm her authority, or someone from the Surveyor peoples to acknowledge her legitimacy. Without confirmation from both Above and Below, she's only pretending to be High Priestess. The pretense is necessary—the faithful need leadership—but it gnaws at her.

**The Complication:** Solveig is theologically conservative in ways that create problems. She insists on performing rituals correctly, even when "correctly" requires participants who no longer exist. She waits for confirmations that may never come. Her devotion to proper procedure is paralyzing the faith at exactly the moment when flexibility might save it.

---

## Kagg Ironhand of Thrymheim

**Full Name and Titles:** Kagg son of Kolg, Ironhand of the Forge, Voice-Behind-the-Gate
**Role:** Dwarven liaison (speaking through sealed gates)

**Character:** Kagg is one of perhaps a dozen dwarves who remain in Nordgard's Steinheim district, maintaining essential systems and serving as the official channel for communication with Thrymheim. He's ancient by human standards—three hundred years old, though dwarven age is difficult to read—with iron-grey skin and hands permanently stained by forge-work. His voice, coming through the speaking-tube of the sealed Forge-Gate, is the only regular contact Nordgard has with the dwarven civilization below.

Kagg was chosen for this role because he's expendable. The dwarves who matter are safe in Thrymheim; Kagg and his colleagues are sacrifices to the principle that obligations must be honored. He knows this and is not bitter—it's simply how things work.

**What He Wants:** Kagg wants to go home. He's tired, he's old, and maintaining heating systems in an empty quarter is not how he expected to spend his final centuries. But duty holds him here, and duty requires that he continue speaking for Thrymheim even when Thrymheim gives him nothing to say.

**The Complication:** Kagg knows things he can't share. He knows why the gates are sealed—what the Kobalthari saw in the cobalt-veins during the Passing, what the Delvers fear. He's been ordered to maintain contact but reveal nothing. The secrets weigh on him; several times he's almost spoken. Someone persistent might get him to talk.

---

## Silence-After-Thunder (Þögn-eftir-Þrumu)

**Full Name and Titles:** Silence-After-Thunder of the Seventh Wind-Choir (pre-Passing); no current titles acknowledged
**Role:** Traumatized Aetherwing survivor; unofficial weather-prophet

**Character:** Aetherwings were the weather-readers of the Surveyor peoples: translucent beings with hair that moves in unfelt breezes, capable of sensing atmospheric patterns humans can't perceive. Silence-After-Thunder was a respected member of Skyhallow's meteorological college until the Passing destroyed everything she knew.

She has taken up residence in Nordgard's Aurora-Tower, spending her days staring at skies that betrayed her people, her nights screaming nightmares that echo across the city. She eats when food is brought; otherwise she does nothing but watch. Despite her apparent catatonia, she sometimes speaks—usually weather predictions that prove accurate, occasionally fragments of prophecy that no one understands.

**What She Wants:** Silence-After-Thunder wants the sky to make sense again. The Passing broke the weather-patterns she spent her life learning; the atmosphere now moves in ways that shouldn't be possible. She watches constantly because she's trying to understand the new rules. She hasn't succeeded. She may never succeed.

**The Complication:** Silence-After-Thunder knows more than she can communicate. She perceived things during the Passing that other peoples couldn't sense—the shapes of the eldritch creatures, the way they bent reality, perhaps even patterns in their movements. But her mind was damaged by what she saw; she can't organize the knowledge into communicable form. Someone who could help her heal might unlock invaluable information.

# 5. Local Conditions

## The Reft Situation

**Density:** Moderate to high in the passes, low in the valleys

The mountain Reft congregate in the high places—passes, peaks, and the approaches to Skyhallow. The reasons are unclear; theories include the residual realm-field distortion from the destroyed Surveyor architecture, the natural energy-channeling properties of the peaks, or simple coincidence. Whatever the cause, the passes that once connected the High Marches to the outside world are now death-traps.

**Predominant Types:**

| Type | Frequency | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------|
| Storm Reft (Peaks) | High | Aggressive, crackling with static, concentrate at high elevations |
| Bone Reft (Death) | Moderate | Found near the mass graves below Skyhallow |
| Empty Reft (Abyss) | Low but terrifying | Occasionally reported; erases memories of encounters |

**Distribution Patterns:**
- The Giants' Stair concentration: dozens of Storm Reft gathered on the ancient steps
- The Skyhallow approaches: mixed types, extremely dangerous
- Valley floors: relatively clear, patrols maintain safety
- The passes: unpredictable; some days clear, some days impassable

**Defensive Measures:**
- Duke Bjorn's patrols maintain the Nordgard valley perimeter
- Vaktborg provides early warning of Reft movements
- The Iron Gates of Eisenpass can seal the main pass if needed
- Individual settlements maintain their own watches

## Travel

**Internal Movement:** Relatively safe within the valley system. Duke Bjorn's patrols maintain cleared routes between Nordgard and the smaller settlements. Travel times are doubled in winter when snow blocks paths.

**External Connections:**

| Route | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Via Montana (south to Heartland) | Dangerous | Pass Reft; some traffic continues |
| Thrymweg (north to Skyhallow) | Closed | Mass Reft, no reason to go |
| Thrymheim Gate-Road (underground) | Sealed | Gates closed from within |
| Western passes (to Fjordlands) | Dangerous | Storm Reft; rarely attempted |
| Eastern passes (to Pinelands) | Possible | Least Reft-infested, but remote |

**Travel Methods:**
- On foot with armed escort (standard)
- Horseback (horses scarce; most eaten in early crisis)
- Dwarven heating-sleds (rare; require dwarven cooperation)

## Trade

**What Nordgard Produces:**
- Mountain herbs (medicinal and culinary)
- Wool from highland sheep
- Preserved meats
- Hot springs minerals (limited market)
- Salvage from Skyhallow (increasingly exploited)

**What Nordgard Needs:**
- Grain (desperately)
- Metal tools (previously from dwarves; stocks depleting)
- Weapons (defensive needs increasing)
- Timber (for fuel and construction)
- Everything the dwarves once provided

**Current Trade Reality:**
Almost no external trade functions. Occasional desperate merchants brave the Via Montana with grain, accepting payment in Skyhallow salvage or promissory notes that may never be honored. The internal economy has reverted to barter and favor-trading.

**The Dwarven Question:**
Everything depends on whether the Forge-Gate reopens. Thrymheim could supply tools, weapons, and the manufactured goods that made northern life viable. But the gates remain closed, and no one outside knows what the dwarves want to open them.

## Religion

**Official Position:** The Solarian Church claims jurisdiction, with St. Magnus of the Mountains serving the faithful and Father Ingmar providing spiritual guidance.

**Actual Practice:**
The Axis Faith remains dominant despite having no confirmed leadership. Most Nordgard residents follow Axis traditions—the marketplace-as-temple, the sacred exchange, the Meeting Point theology—even if they occasionally attend St. Magnus for the familiar rituals.

**Religious Tensions:**
- The Axis Faith is leaderless and struggling
- The Solarian Church is gaining converts but lacks local credibility
- Old folk traditions (mountain spirits, ancestor-speaking) persist despite official discouragement
- Some survivors have lost faith entirely; some have found it

**Current Religious Crisis:**
The Axis Faith taught that the powers Above and Below were in balance, channeled through the Meeting Point. The Passing destroyed the Above component. Does the faith still make sense with only half its cosmology functioning? Solveig says yes; others aren't sure.

## The Scars

The High Marches bears several Passing-wounds:

**The Skyhallow Debris Field:** Hundreds of square miles littered with fallen Surveyor architecture. The debris isn't just physical—reality is thin here, prone to small glitches and odd effects. Time occasionally stutters; distances don't always match maps.

**The Weeping Glacier:** The glacier's strange behavior predates the Passing but has intensified since. The glacier seems to be responding to something, producing dream-inducing meltwater and humming vibrations.

**The Silence Zones:** Patches of mountain terrain where sound doesn't carry normally. Entering a Silence Zone, you can scream and barely hear yourself. These zones appeared after the Passing and have not faded.

**The Aurora Wrongness:** The Northern Lights have changed. Colors that weren't previously possible now appear; patterns have shifted; Axis Faith priests can no longer read their meaning. Silence-After-Thunder watches constantly, trying to understand.

# 6. Adventure Hooks

## "The Voice Behind the Gate"

Kagg Ironhand has sent a coded message through unofficial channels: he's willing to talk about what the dwarves saw during the Passing, but only to someone who comes to him secretly, not through Duke Bjorn's official diplomacy. The message implies that the dwarves might reopen trade if certain conditions are met—but those conditions require surface action that the dwarves can't take themselves.

**What's Really Happening:** The Kobalthari read something terrible in the cobalt-veins during the Passing. They believe another event is coming and that surface preparations are necessary. But the Thrymheim Council has forbidden contact; Kagg is acting without authorization. If he's caught, the consequences could permanently sever dwarf-human relations.

**Possible Developments:**
- Retrieving something from Skyhallow that the dwarves need
- Eliminating a threat that the dwarves have detected but can't address from below
- Political intrigue within Thrymheim that surface agents might influence
- Discovering that the dwarves' fears are exaggerated—or worse than they know

---

## "The Star-Hall Expedition"

The Fallen Observatory contains instruments that might predict weather, track celestial movements, or reveal what the Passing creatures actually were. But no one has successfully entered since it crashed. Silence-After-Thunder might be willing to guide an expedition—she's been staring at the wreck for months—but first someone needs to break through her trauma enough to communicate.

**What's Really Happening:** The Star-Hall is intact but not empty. Something is living inside—not Reft, but something that came down with the observatory and survived the crash. The lights that move at night are not instruments activating randomly.

**Possible Developments:**
- A surviving Surveyor who's been too damaged to seek help
- A Passing creature that got trapped when the observatory fell
- An emergent phenomenon—something new, born from the collision of Surveyor technology and Passing energy
- Ancient star-charts showing the creatures' point of origin

---

## "The Storm Stair"

The Storm Reft gathering at the Giants' Stair are increasing in number. If they begin moving toward Nordgard, the city's defenses won't hold. Duke Bjorn needs someone to investigate—determine why they're gathering, whether they can be dispersed, and what happens if they can't.

**What's Really Happening:** The Giants' Stair is a real artifact from the God-Giant War—not a natural formation, but a structure built by giants for a purpose that was never completed. The Storm Reft are unconsciously responding to something in the stairs: a call, a pattern, an activation sequence that the Passing partially triggered. If the sequence completes, something will wake up.

**Possible Developments:**
- Stopping the activation (if it's dangerous)
- Completing the activation (if it's beneficial)
- Discovering what the giants were actually doing there
- Finding that the giants' enemy is related to the Passing creatures

---

## "The Pilgrimage That Continues"

Father Ingmar at St. Magnus has received strange reports: pilgrims are still climbing toward Skyhallow. Not alive—the Bone Reft that haunt the debris fields were pilgrims who died in the Passing, and they're still trying to reach the Meeting Temple. They climb the ten thousand stairs, fall, rise, and climb again. The behavior doesn't match normal Reft patterns; these seem to have purpose.

**What's Really Happening:** The pilgrims died in a state of extreme devotion, their souls reaching for a religious experience that never came. They're not random Reft—they're caught in a loop, trying to complete a journey that can no longer be completed. Someone who understood the Axis Faith might be able to give them rest. Or someone who understood the Passing might discover why this loop formed when most Reft are purposeless.

**Possible Developments:**
- A ritual that finally sends the pilgrims to their rest
- Discovery of a Meeting Temple aspect that survived the destruction
- Encounter with pilgrims who retain fragments of their living memories
- Evidence that the Passing didn't just kill—it trapped souls in ways the Underworld can't process

---

## "The Glacier's Voice"

The Weeping Glacier's strange behavior is intensifying. The meltwater now causes vivid prophetic dreams; the ice hums at frequencies that make the chest ache; and expedition parties have been vanishing into crevasses. Something inside the glacier wants attention. Duke Bjorn needs to know whether it's a threat or an opportunity—and he needs to know before spring melt makes the glacier inaccessible.

**What's Really Happening:** The glacier contains something sleeping—not a giant, not exactly, but something from the same era. The Passing disturbed its slumber without fully waking it. The meltwater carries fragments of its dreams; the humming is its murmured speech. It's trying to communicate, but the only language it knows has been dead for millennia.

**Possible Developments:**
- Learning to communicate with whatever sleeps beneath the ice
- Discovering that waking it would be catastrophic
- Finding that it's a potential ally against future threats
- Uncovering a connection between the sleeper and Katiari's forgotten bargains
