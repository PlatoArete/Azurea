# Old Downs (Bryniau Hen): Sub-Region Development
## Azurea Worldbuilding Project — Round 2.1

---

# Overview

**Region:** The West (Provincia Occidentalis / Gorllewin)
**Imperial Name:** Regio Collium
**Local Name:** Bryniau Hen ("Ancient Hills")
**Capital:** Caer Bryn
**City Density:** Moderate — 1 major city per 120 miles

**Character Summary:** Rolling chalk downland south of the Kingswood, dominated by sheep pastures and ancient monuments. The old ways never died here—they simply went quiet when the Church arrived and are now speaking again. Standing stones mark the landscape like the bones of sleeping giants. Barrow-mounds hold the honored dead of ages past. The veil between worlds has always been thin in the Old Downs, and since the Passing, it grows thinner still.

# Part One: The Capital City

## Caer Bryn — The Hill-Fort

**Imperial Name:** Collis Castrum
**Common Name:** Bryn-Hold, the Shepherd's Crown
**Meaning:** "Hill-Fort" (Brythonic)

### Location

Caer Bryn crowns a chalk promontory at the heart of the Old Downs, where three ancient trackways meet. The hill rises three hundred feet above the surrounding downland, its white flanks visible for miles in every direction. From its summit, one can see the dark line of the Kingswood to the north, the glitter of distant sea to the west, and rolling chalk hills stretching south and east until they blur into haze.

The town is built on and within earthworks that predate human memory—concentric rings of ditch and bank that spiral up the hill like the shell of some vast, slumbering creature. Whether the Fae built them, or the giants, or humans so ancient they might as well be neither, no one knows. The Church claimed they were merely old fortifications. The locals know better.

### Scale

| Period | Population | Notes |
|--------|------------|-------|
| Pre-Passing | ~18,000 | Regional market center, modest Imperial presence |
| Post-Passing | ~12,000 | Reduced but stable; refugees offset by plague losses |

Caer Bryn was never a great city by Imperial standards—too remote, too pastoral, too stubbornly attached to traditions the Church found inconvenient. Its population reflects its role: a market town serving shepherds and wool merchants, a pilgrimage site for those who remember the old ways, and an administrative center for a region the Empire never fully understood.

### The Five Rings (Districts)

The earthworks create natural divisions. Locals speak of "going up" or "going down" to indicate social and spiritual status as much as physical elevation.

#### 1. The Outer Ring (Y Cylch Allanol)

The lowest and largest ring, pressed against the ancient outer ditch. This is where the common folk live—shepherds' families, wool-workers, craftsmen, laborers. Timber-and-thatch buildings lean against the earthwork banks. The streets are unpaved, becoming rivers of mud in wet weather and clouds of chalk dust in dry.

**Character:** Humble but not poor. The wool trade provides steady work. Houses cluster around communal wells and small shrines—some to Church saints, more to older guardians. Chickens wander freely. The smell is lanolin, woodsmoke, and honest labor.

**Notable Features:**
- **The Fleece Market** — Open square where raw wool is bought and sold
- **The Drovers' Rest** — Large inn with pens for livestock
- **Shrine of Saint Columba** — Church presence, but locals have added offerings to older spirits

#### 2. The Middle Ring (Y Cylch Canol)

The mercantile heart of Caer Bryn. Wool merchants, cloth traders, craftsmen who've achieved mastery, and minor gentry live here. Stone buildings begin to appear among the timber—chalk blocks cut from the hill itself, giving everything a pale, ghostly quality.

**Character:** Prosperous, practical, quietly proud. The merchants here have grown wealthy selling Downs wool to the Empire's weavers. They display that wealth carefully—fine wool clothing rather than silk, carved stone rather than gilded wood. They remember who they are.

**Notable Features:**
- **The Cloth Hall** — Where finished wool goods are traded; headquarters of the Weavers' Guild
- **The Merchant Quarter** — Fine stone houses with walled gardens
- **The Imperial Waystation** — Once the tax collector's office; now abandoned

#### 3. The High Ring (Y Cylch Uchel)

The old noble quarter, where the Lord's family and their closest retainers dwell. The earthworks here are highest, the views most commanding. Buildings are older, built in a style that predates Imperial influence—round rather than square, with central hearths and smoke-holes rather than chimneys.

**Character:** Ancient wealth, ancient obligation. The families here trace their lines back to before the Empire. They served the Church because they had to; they're returning to older loyalties because they can. There's a weight to this place—not oppressive, but present. The stones remember.

**Notable Features:**
- **Bryn-Hold** — The Lord's hall, built around an ancient standing stone
- **The War-Hall** — Where the fyrd (militia) musters in times of threat
- **The Ancestors' House** — Where genealogies are kept and honored dead are remembered

#### 4. The Inner Ring (Y Cylch Mewnol)

Not a residential district but a sacred precinct. The innermost earthwork ring contains only three structures: the old Church, the older shrine, and the oldest stone.

**Character:** Liminal. The air feels different here—thicker, charged, watching. Visitors speak in whispers without knowing why. Dogs whine and refuse to enter. Children fall silent. The Church tried for centuries to claim this space; the space never accepted them.

**Notable Features:**
- **The Chapel of Saint Bryn** — The Church's attempt to Christianize a pagan site; now quietly abandoned
- **The Moon-Shrine** — Older temple to unnamed powers; openly tended again
- **The King-Stone** — A massive standing stone at the hill's summit, predating all human construction

#### 5. The Warren (Y Tyllu)

Beneath Caer Bryn, carved into the chalk itself, lies a network of tunnels, chambers, and crypts. Some are natural; most are not. The Church claimed they were merely storage cellars and catacombs. The locals know they go deeper, and that some passages lead to places that aren't entirely in this world.

**Character:** Hidden, sacred, dangerous. The Warren isn't one thing but many—wine cellars that become ancestor crypts that become ritual chambers that become something else entirely. Only the initiated know the full extent. Only the desperate enter uninvited.

**Notable Features:**
- **The Merchant Cellars** — Upper levels, used for legitimate storage
- **The Bone-Hall** — Where the honored dead of Caer Bryn have been interred for millennia
- **The Deep-Shrines** — Lower levels, their purposes unknown to outsiders
- **The Sealed Passages** — Tunnels blocked with ancient stone; what lies beyond, none will say

### Landmarks

#### The King-Stone (Maen Brenin)

At the summit of Caer Bryn stands a single stone, fifteen feet tall, rough-hewn from rock not found anywhere in the Downs. It was here before the earthworks. It was here before humans. According to the Fae (who speak of it rarely), it was here before the Hawthorne.

The Church tried to destroy it three times. Hammers shattered. Workers sickened. The third time, a cardinal who supervised the attempt was found dead in his chambers, his face frozen in an expression no one wanted to describe. After that, they built a chapel around it instead and claimed it was a monument to Saint Bryn (a saint no one had heard of before or since).

Since the Passing, the chapel has been quietly abandoned. The stone stands open to the sky again. People leave offerings at its base: bread, flowers, drops of milk, threads of wool. It seems content.

#### The Cloth Hall (Neuadd y Brethyn)

The largest secular building in Caer Bryn, the Cloth Hall dominates the Middle Ring's main square. Three stories of pale chalk-stone, with a great wooden roof supported by beams carved with sheep and shepherd figures. Inside, the ground floor is an open trading floor where merchants bargain over wool bales. The upper floors hold guild offices, arbitration chambers, and the famous Tapestry Room.

The Tapestry Room displays the Downs History—a series of woven panels depicting the region's story from mythic times to the present. The oldest panels show figures that aren't quite human tending vast flocks across hills unmarked by human settlement. The newest panels, added since the Passing, show dark shapes in the sky and people gathered around standing stones for protection.

#### The Moon-Shrine (Cysegr y Lleuad)

In the Inner Ring, partially carved into the chalk beside the King-Stone's chapel, stands a structure older than the Church by millennia. Its design is simple: a circular chamber with an oculus open to the sky, surrounded by a ring of smaller stones. At certain times—full moons, solstices, equinoxes—the moonlight (or sunlight) falls through the oculus to illuminate specific stones in sequence, telling a story in light that the initiated can read.

The Church sealed the Moon-Shrine and built their chapel to block its entrance. Since the Passing, the seals have been broken. The Shrine-Keepers tend it openly now, though they're careful about who they teach to read its light-language.

#### The Spiral Way

The ancient trackway that spirals up Caer Bryn's slopes follows the earthwork ditches in a pattern that isn't quite practical. It's longer than necessary, with turns that seem designed to disorient rather than facilitate. Locals say you're meant to walk it slowly, contemplatively, letting the journey change you before you reach the top.

Visitors who try to cut across the earthworks—climbing directly rather than following the Spiral Way—often find themselves lost, turned around, or simply back where they started. The hill doesn't like shortcuts.

### Atmosphere

**Sights:** White chalk buildings against green grass. Sheep dotting distant hillsides. The King-Stone's shadow moving across the summit. Wool-heavy carts on the Spiral Way. Offerings at standing stones. The dark line of the Kingswood on the northern horizon.

**Sounds:** Bleating sheep (always, everywhere). The clack of looms. Wind across the downs—the chalk hills catch and focus it, creating whistles and moans that locals claim are voices. Church bells still ring (habit dies hard), but older drums answer now on certain nights.

**Smells:** Lanolin. Chalk dust. Woodsmoke. The particular green scent of downland grass. Something older in the Inner Ring—not unpleasant, but *present*, like standing near sleeping greatness.

**Feel:** Watching. Not hostile, but aware. The hill knows you're here. The stones have noticed. The land itself is paying attention in a way that cities never do. It's not frightening, exactly—more like being a guest in a house whose owner is very, very old and very, very patient.

### Who Rules

**Lord Cadoc ap Rhys, the Stone-Sworn**

The hereditary Lord of the Downs, a man caught between worlds. Cadoc's family served the Empire faithfully for generations—not from love, but from pragmatism. They kept the old ways privately while presenting a Church-compliant face publicly. They survived.

Now the Empire is falling, and Cadoc has made a choice. In a public ceremony six months after the Passing, he swore an oath at the King-Stone, renouncing his Imperial titles and claiming authority by ancient right. The few remaining Church officials called it treason. His people called it homecoming.

Cadoc rules through a council that blends old and new:
- **The Thing-Moot** — Revival of ancient assembly; all free adults may speak
- **The Stone-Keepers** — Priests of the old ways, newly empowered
- **The Merchant Guild** — Practical men who care about stability
- **The Shepherd Council** — Representatives of the flocks and those who tend them

### The Tension

The return to old ways isn't universally welcomed. Caer Bryn's population includes:

**The Returned** — Those who embrace the revival, often with enthusiasm that makes the moderate uncomfortable. They want to tear down every Church building, burn every Imperial record, pretend the last five centuries never happened.

**The Cautious** — Those who accept the change but worry about consequences. What happens when the Empire recovers? What happens if the old powers aren't as benevolent as memory suggests?

**The Faithful** — A small but persistent minority who genuinely believe in the Light. They've lost their priests (fled or converted), their institutions (dissolved), their certainty (shattered by the Passing). But faith doesn't die easily, and some still pray in the abandoned chapel, hoping the Light will answer.

**The Practical** — The merchants, who don't care which gods are worshipped as long as the wool trade continues. They'll burn incense to anything if it keeps the roads safe.

And underneath it all, a question no one wants to ask: the old ways couldn't prevent the Passing any more than the Church could. If the stones and the spirits and the ancient powers are real, why didn't they protect their people?

# Part Two: Secondary Settlements

## 1. Maenffair — The Stone-Fair

**Imperial Name:** Forum Lapideum
**Common Name:** Stone-Market
**Meaning:** "Stone-Fair" (Brythonic)

### Location

A day's ride southwest of Caer Bryn, where the ancient trackway called the Stone-Road passes within sight of the great circle of Maenllwyd. The town grew up around the seasonal fairs held at the stones—traders coming from across the Downs to buy and sell in the shadow of the ancestors.

### Type

Market town and pilgrimage center.

### Population

| Period | Population |
|--------|------------|
| Pre-Passing | ~6,000 |
| Post-Passing | ~4,500 |

### Character

Maenffair has always been two towns: the permanent settlement of craftsmen, innkeepers, and stone-tenders who live here year-round, and the sprawling fair that materializes four times a year for the great market-moots at the solstices and equinoxes.

The permanent town clusters along the Stone-Road, practical timber buildings serving travelers and pilgrims. But at fair-time, the population swells tenfold as merchants, shepherds, entertainers, and seekers fill every field within a mile of the stones. Temporary markets spring up. Judgment-moots settle disputes. Young people find partners. Debts are paid and grudges settled. The old ways never needed temples—they had the fairs.

Since the Passing, the fairs have grown larger rather than smaller. People come seeking answers, seeking community, seeking something to believe in now that the Church has failed. The stone-tenders struggle to manage crowds who want miracles the stones were never meant to provide.

### Notable Feature

**The Moot-Stone**

At the town's center stands a single stone, the "Little Brother" to Maenllwyd's circle. By ancient law, this stone marks neutral ground. No blood may be shed within sight of it. Disputes brought here must be resolved through speech, not steel. Even during the Empire's rule, the Moot-Stone was respected—Imperial judges conducted trials in its shadow, lending their verdicts ancient legitimacy.

Now it serves as the seat of the Old Downs' highest court. Lord Cadoc travels here quarterly to hear appeals and settle disputes too significant for local moots. The Stone-Keepers attend to ensure proper forms are observed. Justice in the Old Downs is ancient, formal, and very, very public.

---

## 2. Cors Gwynn — The White Marsh

**Imperial Name:** Fons Sanctus (Holy Spring)
**Common Name:** White-Wells, the Healing Waters
**Meaning:** "White Marsh" (Brythonic)

### Location

In a chalk valley two days' ride north of Caer Bryn, where springs emerge from the downland to feed a complex of pools, streams, and marshland before the waters disappear underground again. The chalk makes the water appear white—milky, opalescent, seemingly lit from within.

### Type

Pilgrimage center and healing sanctuary.

### Population

| Period | Population |
|--------|------------|
| Pre-Passing | ~3,500 |
| Post-Passing | ~5,000 (swollen with desperate seekers) |

### Character

The springs of Cors Gwynn have been sacred since before memory. The waters are genuinely healing—something in the chalk, or something older than the chalk, eases pain and speeds recovery. The Church claimed the springs for Saint Gwyneira ("White Snow"), built a monastery over the main pool, and charged pilgrims for access.

The monastery is abandoned now, its remaining monks fled south or converted to older practices. The Well-Keepers—a sisterhood that predates the Church and never truly stopped existing—have resumed public care of the springs. They charge nothing for access but require offerings: a thread of wool dropped in the water, a song sung at dawn, a secret whispered to the pool. The waters, they say, drink stories as thirsty as any drought.

Since the Passing, Cors Gwynn has swelled with the desperate. People who lost everything to the plague come seeking cure. People who lost everything to the Reft come seeking comfort. The Well-Keepers turn no one away, but they warn: the waters heal the body, not the soul. Those seeking miracles often leave disappointed. Those seeking peace sometimes find it.

### Notable Feature

**The White Pool (Pwll Gwyn)**

At the center of the spring complex lies a single pool, perfectly circular, its waters white as milk. The Church called it a natural wonder. The Well-Keepers know it's a window.

At certain times—mostly midnight, mostly during liminal dates—the pool's surface shows things. Not reflections, but *visions*. Seekers who gaze into it at the right moment might see loved ones (living or dead), glimpses of possible futures, or shapes that don't belong to any known category. The Well-Keepers supervise such viewings carefully. Most visions are harmless, even helpful. But the pool has shown things that drove viewers mad, and no one knows what determines the difference.

Since the Passing, the pool has been more active, its visions more frequent and more disturbing. The Well-Keepers have restricted access. Rumors spread about what they've seen. They're not talking.

---

## 3. Crug Terfyn — The Boundary Barrow

**Imperial Name:** Collis Limitis
**Common Name:** End-Hill, the Border-Mound
**Meaning:** "Boundary Barrow" (Brythonic)

### Location

At the Old Downs' eastern edge, where chalk gives way to the farmland of the Greenmarches. An ancient barrow—one of the largest in the region—marks the traditional boundary. The town grew up around it, serving travelers, traders, and those who for various reasons preferred to live at edges rather than centers.

### Type

Border town and crossroads settlement.

### Population

| Period | Population |
|--------|------------|
| Pre-Passing | ~4,000 |
| Post-Passing | ~2,800 |

### Character

Crug Terfyn has always attracted the in-between: people who didn't quite fit in either the Downs' ancient ways or the Greenmarches' Imperial culture. The town contains both a Church chapel and a stone shrine, and many residents attended both without seeing contradiction. The Imperial garrison stationed here learned quickly that local customs were worth respecting.

Now the garrison is gone—dead, fled, or absorbed into the local militia. The town finds itself a gatekeeper: the Greenmarches are chaotic, dangerous, overrun with Reft and refugees. The Old Downs are stable, protected, increasingly isolationist. Crug Terfyn decides who crosses the boundary.

The town's leadership—an uneasy alliance of the old Barrow-Keeper, a former Imperial sergeant, and a merchant consortium—has established rules: refugees can enter if they'll accept Downs law and contribute to Downs defense. Raiders, bandits, or those too visibly loyal to the failing Empire are turned away. It's harsh but effective. Crug Terfyn is the Old Downs' shield and its conscience.

### Notable Feature

**The Watcher's Barrow**

The great barrow from which the town takes its name is thirty feet high and two hundred feet long, its shape suggesting a sleeping figure facing east. Local tradition says a king is buried there—one who fell defending the Downs from ancient invasion—and that he will wake if the land is ever truly threatened.

Whether the tradition is true, the Barrow-Keepers have tended the mound since before memory. They perform daily rituals at its entrance, leave offerings, sing songs in a language no one else understands. They claim the king still watches, and that he has opinions about who crosses his boundary.

Since the Passing, travelers approaching from the east report... feelings. A sense of being observed. A pressure to turn back, to leave, to go elsewhere. Those the Barrow-Keepers approve of feel it lift as they approach the town. Those they don't approve of find it intensifying until they turn back or collapse.

The Barrow-Keepers aren't explaining how this works. But they're smiling more than they used to.

---

## 4. Ffynnon Ddu — The Black Well

**Imperial Name:** Fons Obscurum (unofficial; never on maps)
**Common Name:** Dark-Spring, the Forgotten Well
**Meaning:** "Black Well" (Brythonic)

### Location

In a chalk coomb (dry valley) in the southern Downs, half a day's ride from anywhere. No major roads lead here. No towns stand nearby. Imperial maps marked the area as empty pastureland. Imperial maps were wrong.

### Type

Hidden village and Revnan sanctuary.

### Population

| Period | Population |
|--------|------------|
| Pre-Passing | ~300 (officially zero) |
| Post-Passing | ~500 |

### Character

Ffynnon Ddu has existed, in some form, since before the Empire. It served as sanctuary for those practicing traditions the Church couldn't tolerate—Revnan mysteries, Ostaran death-rites, practices that mixed and matched from every tradition. The village was never large, never visible, never acknowledged. Shepherds who stumbled upon it were given hospitality and firm suggestions to forget they'd visited.

The well that gives the village its name emerges from deep chalk, filtered through layers so ancient the water emerges black—not dirty, but dark, like liquid obsidian. The Revnan practitioners who've always been the village's core say the darkness isn't absence of light but presence of depth. They use it in ceremonies the Church would have called witchcraft. They call it truth.

Since the Passing, Ffynnon Ddu has cautiously emerged from hiding. They've sent representatives to Caer Bryn, offering their knowledge of the Dark realm-field to help combat the Reft (Shadow Reft are particularly susceptible to proper Revnan handling). They're still cautious—centuries of hiding don't fade quickly—but they're no longer pretending not to exist.

### Notable Feature

**The Telling Chamber**

Deep beneath the village, carved into the chalk in ages past, lies a circular chamber where the Black Well emerges. The water is perfectly still, perfectly dark, perfectly reflective of nothing. Those who sit in the chamber, guided by trained practitioners, can enter states of deep introspection—seeing their own shadows, their hidden fears, their denied truths.

It's not pleasant. It's rarely safe. But for those seeking to understand themselves—particularly those haunted by what the Passing revealed about them—the Telling Chamber offers something no Light-tradition ever could: acceptance of darkness as necessary rather than evil.

---

# Part Three: Notable Sites

## 1. The Great Stones of Maenllwyd (The Grey-Stone Circle)

**Type:** Megalithic monument / sacred site
**Location:** A mile southwest of Maenffair, on a chalk ridge commanding views in all directions

### History

Maenllwyd predates human memory. The stones—forty-two uprights forming a circle three hundred feet across, with an inner horseshoe of taller trilithons—were ancient when the first humans arrived in the Downs. The Fae claim not to have built them but to have found them here. When pressed about who did build them, they change the subject.

The Church tried various approaches: claiming the stones were built by early saints, attempting to topple them (hammers shattered), building a chapel nearby (struck by lightning three times), and finally deciding to ignore them while strictly forbidding participation in the "pagan superstitions" practiced there. The superstitions continued anyway, just quietly.

### Current State

Since the Passing, Maenllwyd has resumed its ancient function as the Old Downs' primary sacred site. The Stone-Keepers—an order that survived Church suppression by pretending to be eccentric antiquarians—now perform public ceremonies at the solstices and equinoxes. Hundreds gather to watch. Thousands come to the associated fairs.

The stones themselves seem... pleased. Locals report they stand straighter than they did a decade ago. Some that had fallen have mysteriously righted themselves. At night, some claim to see light emanating from the trilithons—not fire, not moonlight, something older.

### The Hook

The spring equinox ceremony is approaching, and something is wrong. The Stone-Keepers report that one of the central trilithons—the "Sun-Gate" through which equinox sunrise is supposed to shine—has shifted. Not fallen, not damaged, *moved*. It now faces a different point on the horizon. Either someone has somehow rotated a fifty-ton stone, or it moved itself. Either option is disturbing. The Stone-Keepers are quietly panicking while publicly insisting everything is fine. They need help determining what happened and what it means—before a thousand pilgrims arrive expecting a miracle and witness a catastrophe.

---

## 2. The Long Barrow of the Kings (Crug y Brenhinoedd)

**Type:** Ancient burial monument / ancestor shrine
**Location:** Two hours' walk northeast of Caer Bryn, on a hilltop overlooking the main approach from the Heartland

### History

The Long Barrow is the oldest and largest burial mound in the Downs—three hundred feet long, forty feet wide, its entrance flanked by stones carved with spiral patterns that make observers dizzy if stared at too long. According to tradition, the first kings of the Downs are buried here, along with their families, their treasures, and things the traditions describe only as "what they protected."

The Church declared the barrow a pagan abomination and forbade entry. Attempts to excavate it for treasure (several Imperial governors tried) ended in worker deaths, equipment failure, and in one case, the governor's sudden and permanent madness. The barrow kept its secrets.

### Current State

The Barrow-Keepers of Crug y Brenhinoedd are an ancient order, separate from the Stone-Keepers, with their own traditions and rituals. They never stopped tending the barrow, even during Church suppression—they simply did so at night, claiming to be preventing "decay" rather than performing worship.

Now they work openly, maintaining the entrance stones, clearing the forecourt, and performing ancestor-honoring ceremonies that the Ostaran tradition would recognize as related to their own practices. They still don't let anyone inside. When asked what's in there, they smile and say: "What needs to be protected."

Since the Passing, lights have been seen from inside the barrow—pale, flickering, moving in patterns that suggest procession rather than fire. The Barrow-Keepers won't explain. They seem more reverent than afraid.

### The Hook

A merchant traveling at night swears he saw figures emerging from the barrow—not ghosts, not Reft, but people in ancient dress walking in solemn procession across the hilltop before reentering the mound. When he told this story in Caer Bryn, the Barrow-Keepers asked to speak with him privately. He hasn't been seen since. His family wants answers. Lord Cadoc wants to know what the Barrow-Keepers are hiding. The Barrow-Keepers insist the merchant is "safe, resting, being taught what he needs to know." They won't say more. Someone needs to find out what's actually happening—and whether the ancient kings are really waking up.

---

## 3. The White Mare of Bryn Ceffyl

**Type:** Hill figure / landscape monument
**Location:** On the northwest slopes of Bryn Ceffyl (Horse-Hill), visible from the Stone-Road for miles

### History

Carved into the chalk hillside, a stylized horse figure stretches over three hundred feet from nose to tail. The image is ancient—older than the Empire, older than human memory in the Downs, old enough that the original carvers are lost to legend. The Mare is kept white by regular "scouring"—villagers from surrounding settlements gather annually to clear away grass and vegetation, revealing the chalk beneath.

The Church viewed the Mare as a pagan idol but couldn't figure out how to destroy a hillside. They tried to rebrand it as a symbol of Saint Epona (a saint they invented for the purpose). Locals ignored the rebranding and continued the traditional scouring festival, complete with feasting, horse-races, and practices the Church pretended not to notice.

### Current State

The scouring continues, now without pretense of Church approval. The festival has grown more elaborate—not just cleaning but celebrating, not just maintaining but honoring. Some participants claim to feel something during the scouring, a presence observing them, approving of their work.

The Mare herself seems different since the Passing. More defined, somehow. Sharper. Some travelers report that at certain times—twilight, mostly, or moonlit nights—the figure seems to move. Not dramatically, not galloping, but the eye shifts position, the legs adjust, the head turns slightly to watch whoever's watching.

The locals find this reassuring rather than frightening. The Mare is their protector, their symbol. If she's waking up, that's good news. Isn't it?

### The Hook

The annual scouring festival is approaching, but this year something has changed. Grass is growing on the Mare faster than usual—unnaturally fast, as if the chalk is being deliberately covered. Some sections that were scoured weeks ago are already green again. Worse, the grass growing on the Mare isn't normal downland grass; it's darker, coarser, with a faintly oily sheen. The village elder believes something is trying to blind the Mare—to cover her eyes, specifically—and that if the scouring festival fails this year, something terrible will follow. She needs help defending the scouring parties from whatever is growing that grass, and discovering what wants the Mare blinded.

## 4. The Scar of Crying Voices (Craith y Lleisiau)

**Type:** Passing Wound / Silence Zone
**Location:** An area of downs approximately five miles across, southeast of Cors Gwynn

### History

Before the Passing, this area was unremarkable downland—gentle chalk hills, sheep pastures, a few scattered farms. Now it's empty. The farms stand abandoned. The sheep are gone. Nothing lives there anymore.

During the Passing, witnesses in Cors Gwynn reported hearing sounds from this direction—not the otherworldly calls of the eldritch creatures but human sounds. Crying. Screaming. Pleading. The sounds continued for hours, then stopped abruptly. When people finally went to investigate, they found... nothing. The farms empty, the people gone, no bodies, no blood, no sign of violence. Just silence.

### Current State

The Scar is a Silence—a Passing wound where normal sounds don't function correctly. Step inside, and your footsteps make no noise. Speak, and your words emerge muffled, distant, wrong. Stay too long, and you start hearing *other* sounds—voices, always voices, crying and pleading and calling names. They're not loud, but they're constant, and they seem to come from underground.

No one lives in the Scar. Shepherds drive their flocks around it rather than through it. Travelers take longer routes. The few who've entered and returned report no visible dangers—no Reft, no monsters, nothing hostile. Just the silence, the voices, and an overwhelming sense that something terrible happened here and hasn't stopped happening.

### The Hook

A shepherd's son went into the Scar three days ago, chasing a lost sheep. He hasn't returned. His father went in after him, spent an hour searching, came out unable to speak—not unwilling, *unable*, as if his voice had been taken. He's since recovered enough to communicate in writing, describing what he experienced: the silence, the voices, and a glimpse of something at the center of the Scar. A hole in the ground, perfectly circular, leading down into darkness. The voices were coming from down there. He swears he heard his son's voice among them. Now he wants someone to go in and find the boy—or at least find out what's down that hole and whether his son can be saved.

# Part Four: Key Figures

## 1. Lord Cadoc ap Rhys, the Stone-Sworn

**Title:** Lord of the Old Downs, Keeper of Caer Bryn, Voice of the Thing-Moot
**Age:** 47
**Appearance:** Weathered face, grey-streaked brown hair worn long, beard trimmed short. Dresses in fine wool rather than silk—a statement. Carries an ancient bronze torc he retrieved from the Warren after the Passing, claiming it belonged to his ancestors. His eyes are the grey-blue of chalk pools, patient and watching.

### Character

Cadoc is a man who spent his life preparing for a moment he wasn't sure would ever come. His family served the Empire outwardly while preserving old ways in secret—a dangerous balance maintained for generations. When the Passing shattered Imperial authority, Cadoc saw opportunity where others saw only catastrophe.

He's not a zealot. He doesn't hate the Empire or the Church—he views them as an illness that's finally passing, requiring careful management rather than violent rejection. He worries about the enthusiasts in his own camp, the ones who want to burn everything Imperial and pretend the last five centuries never happened. He knows you can't unmake history. You can only build something new on its bones.

### Goal

To establish the Old Downs as a stable, independent realm—neither part of whatever the Empire becomes nor isolated from it entirely. He wants his people safe, his traditions revived, and his children to inherit something worth having.

### Complication

The old powers are waking up, and Cadoc isn't sure they have his people's best interests at heart. The Stone-Keepers speak of "ancient bargains" and "forgotten obligations." The Barrow-Keepers hint at "what the ancestors expect." Cadoc fears that in trading Imperial masters for ancient ones, he may have merely changed the source of his chains. He's looking for information about what the old powers actually are, what they want, and whether it's possible to honor tradition without becoming its slave.

## 2. Maren Gwynneth, the Moon-Keeper

**Title:** High Keeper of the Moon-Shrine, First Voice of the Stone-Keepers
**Age:** 63
**Appearance:** Small, bent slightly with age, white hair worn in elaborate braids threaded with silver and bone beads. Her eyes are pale—almost colorless—and seem to reflect light in ways that aren't quite natural. Wears robes of undyed wool and carries a staff carved from a wood no one can identify.

### Character

Maren remembers the old days—the *real* old days, before her grandmother's grandmother's time, when the Stone-Keepers had to hide or die. She was initiated at eight, trained in secret caves, learned to read the moon-language before she learned to read Imperial script. She's waited her entire life for this moment.

And now that it's here, she's terrified.

Not of the Empire, not of the Church—of herself. Of her order. Of what they've preserved without fully understanding. The traditions passed down through generations of secrecy aren't complete. Things were lost. Things were changed. Things were added by people who thought they knew what they were doing. Maren fears that the ceremonies they're performing now might be wrong—different enough from the originals to be dangerous.

### Goal

To restore the old traditions correctly—not as they've been passed down, but as they originally existed. She's searching for older sources, hidden records, anything that might confirm or correct what her order practices. She's also trying to make contact with the Fae of the Kingswood, who might remember the original forms, but the forest has closed and her messages go unanswered.

### Complication

Some of her ceremonies are working too well. The stone-light she's called up at Maenllwyd was supposed to be a pale glow, a symbolic representation; instead, it's bright enough to cast shadows and seems to be growing stronger. The King-Stone responds to her invocations in ways that feel less like worship and more like conversation. She's not sure she's leading the revival anymore. She's not sure it's not leading her.

## 3. Father Aldwyn, the Last Kindler

**Title:** (Former) Kindler of the Chapel of Saint Bryn
**Age:** 58
**Appearance:** Tall, gaunt, dressed in worn Church robes he refuses to abandon. Face deeply lined, eyes shadowed by exhaustion and doubt. Hands shake slightly—from age, from fear, from drinking more than he should.

### Character

Aldwyn was a true believer. Not a political priest, not a career clergyman—a man who genuinely loved the Light and devoted his life to bringing it to a region he knew wasn't interested. He served the Chapel of Saint Bryn for twenty-three years, preaching to tiny congregations, performing rites that felt hollow, maintaining a faith that his parishioners tolerated rather than shared.

The Passing broke him. He prayed for protection; none came. He performed the rites of Light against the Reft; they didn't work. He watched his congregation turn away—not with anger, but with sad certainty, as if they'd always known the Light was insufficient and had simply been waiting for proof.

Now he lives in a small room in Caer Bryn's Outer Ring, supported by the charity of people who pity him. He still prays, still believes (mostly), still wears his robes. But he's lost his certainty. And in losing it, he's started seeing things he never saw before—hints that the Light he worshipped might be real but incomplete, one piece of a larger truth the Church never acknowledged.

### Goal

To understand what the Light actually is, if not what the Church claimed. He's begun studying the old traditions, not to convert but to comprehend. He suspects the Theosyn—the old gods, including the Light-gods the Church subsumed—might hold answers the Church deliberately forgot. He wants truth, even if it destroys what's left of his faith.

### Complication

The Scouring has heard about the "heretic priest" who's studying pagan traditions. They've sent agents to investigate. If they decide Aldwyn has genuinely apostasized, they'll execute him—both as punishment and as a warning to others. Aldwyn knows this, but can't stop himself. The questions are too important. The truth is too close.

# Part Five: Local Conditions

## The Reft Situation

The Old Downs are relatively safe from the Reft—safer than almost anywhere else in the former Empire. Several factors contribute:

**Low Population Density:** Fewer people meant fewer Passing deaths, which meant fewer Reft.

**Quick Response:** The Downs' shepherds are organized, mobile, and accustomed to defending flocks from predators. They adapted quickly to hunting Reft, developing tactics that work against the mindless shambling ones.

**The Stones' Protection:** Something about the standing stones and sacred sites seems to repel Reft. Settlements near monuments have lower Reft populations. The Stone-Keepers claim this is intentional—that the stones were always meant to protect—but they seem surprised it's actually working.

**Predominant Type:** When Reft do appear, they're mostly **Root Reft** (attuned to the Land field) and **Empty Reft** (attuned to the Abyss). Root Reft become territorial and stop moving, making them easier to predict and avoid. Empty Reft are disturbing—people forget they're there, walk into them by accident—but they're not aggressive. The Stone-Keepers seem to know how to handle Empty Reft specifically, though they won't explain their methods.

**Areas of Concern:**
- **The Scar of Crying Voices:** Unknown Reft activity within
- **The Eastern Border:** Reft drifting from the chaotic Greenmarches
- **Isolated Farms:** Shepherds working alone are vulnerable

## Travel

**Primary Routes:**

| Route | Character | Current State |
|-------|-----------|---------------|
| **The Stone-Road** | Ancient trackway connecting major stone circles; follows ley-lines | Well-traveled, relatively safe |
| **The Wool-Way** | Trade route from Caer Bryn to the Greenmarches | Dangerous near border, patrolled within Downs |
| **The Shore-Path** | Western route toward Dun Mara and the sea | Passable but exposed to sea-weather |
| **The Pilgrim's Track** | Route connecting Cors Gwynn to other sacred sites | Heavily traveled, Stone-Keeper protected |

**Travel Practices:**

Locals travel in groups when possible, preferably with someone who knows the routes to standing stones and other protected sites. Night travel is avoided unless the moon is full and the traveler knows the paths. Shepherds provide the closest thing to a patrol network—their seasonal movements are predictable, and they report threats to Caer Bryn efficiently.

**Unique Conditions:**

The chalk downs create particular hazards: sudden fogs that rise from valleys, dry winters that leave no snow to track, hidden sinkholes where chalk has collapsed into underground voids. Experienced travelers carry chalk-dust to mark their paths and wool thread to leave in case of getting lost in fog.

## Trade

**Exports:**

| Good | Destination | Value |
|------|-------------|-------|
| **Wool** | The whole former Empire | Primary source of regional wealth; Downs wool is considered the finest |
| **Cheese** | Heartland, West | Sheep's milk cheese, aged in chalk caves |
| **Chalk** | Western Shore, East | Pure chalk for lime, building, and industrial uses |
| **Herbs** | Everywhere | Downland herbs are valued for both culinary and medicinal purposes |
| **Blessed Objects** | The faithful | Since the revival, pilgrims buy tokens from sacred sites |

**Imports:**

| Good | Source | Necessity |
|------|--------|-----------|
| **Timber** | Kingswood (formerly) | Essential; now critical shortage due to forest closure |
| **Metal** | North, Heartland | Limited local ore; dependent on trade |
| **Grain** | Heartland | Downs are pastoral, not agricultural |
| **Salt** | Western Shore | Critical for cheese production and meat preservation |
| **Luxuries** | Anywhere | Silks, spices, etc.—dramatically reduced since Passing |

**Trade Challenges:**

The forest closure has created a timber crisis. Local woods provide some material, but not enough for construction or fuel needs. The Downs are seeking alternative sources, negotiating with the Western Shore for coastal driftwood and with the Greenmarches for whatever can be salvaged. Some suggest trying to contact the Fae to negotiate forest access, but no one knows how.

## Religion

**The Official Picture:**

The Solarian Church is effectively dead in the Old Downs. A few abandoned chapels remain, but no priests serve them. The faithful who remain worship privately or travel to other regions.

**The Actual Picture:**

The old traditions have reasserted themselves with remarkable speed—not as revolutionary replacement but as homecoming. The practices include:

**Stone Veneration:** Care for standing stones, offerings left at bases, ceremonies at solstices and equinoxes. The Stone-Keepers lead, but participation is community-wide.

**Ancestor Honoring:** Barrow-tending, offerings to the dead, consultation with ancestors through ritual. The Ostaran tradition would recognize much of this as kindred practice.

**Land-Spirit Recognition:** Acknowledgment that the hills, springs, and stones have their own awareness. Offerings before taking anything from the land. The Alysian tradition's principles, expressed in Downs idiom.

**The Moon-Rites:** Specifically Revnan-influenced, brought by Ffynnon Ddu's practitioners. Dark-work and dream-practice, now taught openly to those who seek it.

**The Synthesis:**

What's emerging isn't pure recreation of ancient practice but something new—a synthesis informed by memory, adapted to present needs, and influenced by the cross-pollination of traditions that the Passing made necessary. The Stone-Keepers, Barrow-Keepers, Well-Keepers, and Revnan practitioners are cooperating in ways their ancient predecessors might not recognize.

## The Scars (Passing Wounds)

**The Scar of Crying Voices:** Detailed in Notable Sites. A Silence Zone of unusual characteristics.

**The Shadow-Dell:** A small coomb south of Maenffair where daylight doesn't fully penetrate. Even at noon, the dell lies in murky twilight. Shadows move against the light. Something lives there now, but no one has survived close observation long enough to identify it.

**The Wandering Stones:** A circle of smaller stones near the eastern border that have begun moving. Not quickly—a few inches per day—but consistently, in patterns that seem purposeful. They're heading somewhere. No one knows where or why.

---

# Part Six: Adventure Hooks

## 1. The Stone That Moved

**Setup:** The Sun-Gate trilithon at Maenllwyd has shifted position, and the spring equinox ceremony is days away. The Stone-Keepers need someone to investigate without causing panic among the thousands of pilgrims already gathering for the fair.

**Complication:** Investigation reveals the stone didn't move randomly—it's now aligned to a different point on the horizon, one where a smaller, forgotten stone circle once stood. That circle was destroyed by the Church three centuries ago. Why would the Sun-Gate align to something that no longer exists? Unless... it does still exist, somewhere the stone can see but humans cannot.

**Stakes:** If the equinox ceremony fails—if the sun doesn't rise through the Sun-Gate as expected—it could shatter the fragile faith of the revival movement, leading to chaos, despair, and potential violence against the Stone-Keepers who "promised" the old ways would work.

---

## 2. The Barrow's Opened

**Setup:** Lord Cadoc has received disturbing reports: travelers see lights inside the Long Barrow of the Kings, and the Barrow-Keepers are acting strange—secretive, reverent, and one of them was seen carrying food into the barrow. Food for whom? Cadoc needs trusted investigators to discover what's actually happening without provoking a confrontation with an order that might be allied with forces he can't afford to anger.

**Complication:** The Barrow-Keepers are telling the truth—someone has woken inside the barrow. Not a ghost. Not a Reft. A living person, or something very like one, who claims to be the barrow's original occupant. He's been asleep for three thousand years, and he has a great deal to say about what the Downs were, what they've become, and what they're supposed to be. The question is whether his version of events is true, and whether his plans for the future are compatible with Lord Cadoc's.

**Stakes:** If the ancient king is legitimate and his claims valid, he might challenge Cadoc's authority—or become an ally more powerful than anyone since the God-Giant War. If he's something else (a Reft of unusual type, a spirit of unclear nature, a deception by unknown parties), he could tear the Downs apart from within.

---

## 3. The Well's Warning

**Setup:** The Well-Keepers of Cors Gwynn have restricted access to the White Pool, claiming it's "disturbed" and too dangerous for casual viewing. But a noblewoman from the Heartland has arrived, desperate for a vision of her missing husband, willing to pay any price, and threatening to force her way in if denied.

**Complication:** The Pool isn't just disturbed—it's been showing the same vision to everyone who looks: darkness, rising water, something vast moving in the depths. The Well-Keepers fear it's a prophecy, possibly of the Ivy spreading from the Sea into freshwater sources. They need someone to investigate discreetly—to trace the rivers, check the springs, determine whether the vision is warning of something imminent.

**Stakes:** If the vision is accurate and the Ivy is spreading to freshwater, the Old Downs (and everywhere else) are in far more danger than anyone realizes. The plague of the Reft might be nothing compared to what happens when the water itself becomes wrong.

---

## 4. The Shepherd's Silence

**Setup:** The shepherd whose voice was taken in the Scar of Crying Voices wants his son back. Lord Cadoc wants to know what's in that hole at the Scar's center. Maren Gwynneth wants to know whether the Scar can be healed. Everyone agrees someone needs to go in—but the Scar takes voices, and coordination in silence is difficult.

**Complication:** The hole leads down to something that shouldn't exist: a buried chamber, ancient but not of any style the Downs' traditions recognize, containing what appears to be a Silence made solid—a device, or a creature, or something in between, that absorbs sound and stores it. The voices heard in the Scar are voices it's collected, possibly for centuries. The shepherd's son is there, alive but mute, tending the thing as if bound to it. Freeing him might require destroying the device—which might release every voice it's ever taken, at once, with unpredictable results.

**Stakes:** A young man's life. A father's sanity. And potentially, the accumulated sound of centuries—screams, songs, prayers, conversations—released in a single catastrophic moment. What would that even do?

---

## 5. The Kindler's Question

**Setup:** Father Aldwyn has made a breakthrough in his research: he's found references to a Theosyn—a true god, not a Church saint—who was worshipped in the Old Downs before the Church arrived. A god of shepherds, of protection, of the bond between land and people. If this god could be reawakened, properly worshipped, they might provide protection that neither the Church's Light nor the Stone-Keepers' ancient powers can offer. But the Scouring has sent agents to kill Aldwyn as an apostate, and he needs help—both protection from the assassins and assistance completing his research.

**Complication:** The god exists. Aldwyn's research is accurate. But the god isn't sleeping—they're awake, watching, and already working through the Stone-Keepers' revival without anyone realizing. They don't want to be "properly worshipped" in the old forms; they want something else, something new, something that requires Aldwyn specifically. The Scouring's assassins might actually be right that killing Aldwyn would prevent something—they just don't understand what they're preventing, or why the god wants it.

**Stakes:** Aldwyn's life. The assassins' souls (if they're convinced they're doing right while doing wrong). And potentially, the entire religious trajectory of the Old Downs—whether it becomes a revival of genuine ancient practice or something shaped by a god with their own agenda.
