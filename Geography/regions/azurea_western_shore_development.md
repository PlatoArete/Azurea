# Azurea: Western Shore Sub-Region Development
## Round 2.3 — Regio Litoralis / Arfordir

---

# Overview

**Region:** The West (Provincia Occidentalis / Gorllewin)
**Sub-Region:** Western Shore (Regio Litoralis)
**Local Name:** Arfordir ("Sea-Coast")
**Capital:** Dun Mara
**City Density:** Moderate — 1 major city per ~100 miles, linear along coast

**Character Summary:**
The Western Shore is a coastal strip caught between two mysteries. To the east lies the Kingswood—the ancient forest that has *closed* since the Passing, its paths leading in circles, its Fae inhabitants withdrawing into crisis. To the west lies the ocean, and beyond it, Ynys Wyllt—the Wild Isle that has fallen silent in ways that feel more ominous than its centuries of raiding ever did.

The people here are hardened by generations of sea-wind, Wylltic raids, and the knowledge that they live at the edge of the known world. They've always been stubborn, independent, and practical—qualities that served them well when the Empire's authority mattered, and serve them better now that it doesn't.

**Linguistic Notes:**
Local names follow Brythonic/Celtic patterns: Dun- (fort), Aber- (river mouth), Porth- (harbor), -mor/-mara (sea), Traeth- (beach/shore), Caer- (fortress/settlement), Pen- (headland), Ynys- (island).

# Part One: The Capital City

## Dun Mara — The Sea-Fort

**Imperial Name:** Castellum Maris
**Local Name:** Dun Mara ("Fort of the Sea")
**Common Epithet:** The Shield of the West

### Location

Dun Mara commands the most dramatic headland on the western coast—a great fist of black granite punching into the ocean, cliffs dropping two hundred feet to churning water on three sides. The only landward approach is a narrow neck of land easily defended by a single wall. The harbor below is artificial, carved from the living rock over three generations by Imperial engineers and local stonecutters, protected from western swells by massive breakwaters.

The city rises in tiers from harbor to fortress-crown, connected by steep streets and stone staircases that become waterfalls during heavy rain. On clear days, the watchtowers can see forty miles in every direction. On stormy days—and there are many—the entire city vanishes into horizontal rain and sea-spray.

### Scale

| Period | Population | Notes |
|--------|------------|-------|
| Pre-Passing | 15,000 | Military garrison plus support population |
| Post-Passing | ~8,000 | Reduced fleet, but still defensible |

The population is dense by western standards—the headland doesn't permit sprawl. Everyone lives within the walls or in the harbor-town directly below. There are no suburbs, no outlying farms. Everything comes by sea or by the single road east.

### The Four Quarters

#### 1. The Admiralty (Pen-y-Llynges)

**Location:** The fortress-crown, highest point of the headland.

**Character:**
The Admiralty is part fortress, part government, part shrine to the sea itself. The original fortification predates the Empire—a hill-fort of the old tradition, expanded and rebuilt in stone when the Imperial Navy decided this headland would anchor their western defenses.

The complex includes:
- **The Admiral's Tower:** Six stories of weathered granite. Admiral Blackwater's quarters and command center. The signal-fire at its peak has burned continuously for three hundred years—the longest unbroken flame in the West.
- **The Fleet Temple:** Officially Solarian, but the altar faces the sea, not the east. Sailors make offerings to the Light before voyages, but they whisper older names when the priests aren't listening.
- **The Storm Halls:** Meeting chambers and barracks for officers. Named for the carved waves that decorate every lintel.
- **The Chart Room:** The most complete collection of western sea-charts in the Empire, including some that show islands no one has visited in living memory.

**Atmosphere:** Military precision wrapped in salt-spray and superstition. Everything gleams with oil and maintenance; rust is a court-martial offense. But the sailors keep their talismans, and no officer forbids the old prayers.

#### 2. The Harbor-Town (Porthref)

**Location:** The artificial harbor at the base of the cliffs, connected to the upper city by the Grand Stair (three hundred steps carved into rock).

**Character:**
A different world from the Admiralty above. Here the military precision gives way to the organized chaos of a working port: fishing boats and naval vessels sharing the cramped harbor, warehouses bulging with salted fish and repair supplies, taverns where stories grow taller with every telling.

Notable features:
- **The Shipyards:** Three slipways capable of building or repairing anything up to a mid-sized warship. Since the Passing, they've focused on repairs—no new construction, not enough hands.
- **The Fish-Halls:** Covered markets where the day's catch is processed. The smell is omnipresent but somehow less offensive than it should be—something about the constant wind.
- **The Chain-House:** Massive building at the harbor mouth housing the mechanism for the Great Chain—an iron barrier that can be raised to close the harbor entrance against enemy ships. Maintained obsessively; never used in living memory.
- **The Mermaid's Rest:** The largest tavern, built around a carved figurehead salvaged from a wrecked Wylltic ship generations ago. The figure is decidedly un-mermaid-like, but the name stuck.

**Atmosphere:** Busy, practical, occasionally rowdy but never quite out of control. The military garrison keeps a presence, but they know better than to police too aggressively. These are the hands that keep the fleet floating.

#### 3. The Stone-Rows (Rhesi'r Cerrig)

**Location:** The middle tier, between harbor and Admiralty, lining the main street that climbs the headland.

**Character:**
Where the permanent population lives—the families that have been here for generations, whose children become sailors or sailmakers or soldiers, whose grandparents' grandparents helped carve the harbor from rock.

The architecture is distinctive: narrow stone row-houses, three or four stories tall, with sharply pitched slate roofs designed to shed the relentless rain. Ground floors are often workshops or shops; families live above. Windows are small against the wind, but carved deep enough that people can sit in the sills and watch the street below.

Notable features:
- **The Sailor's Shrine:** A Solarian chapel officially, but the statue in the niche is suspiciously similar to Manannán of the old tradition—god of the sea and the lands beyond the horizon.
- **The Stone Market:** Daily market in a small square, selling whatever's available. Before the Passing, goods came from everywhere. Now it's mostly local—fish, rope, carved bone, careful optimism.
- **The Widow's Walk:** An informal name for a stretch of the upper Row where too many windows display the single candle that means someone is waiting for a ship that won't return.

**Atmosphere:** Close-knit, watchful, fiercely protective of their own. Strangers are noticed immediately and observed until the community decides whether to accept or reject them. The old families remember things the Imperial records don't mention.

#### 4. The Neck (Y Gwddf)

**Location:** The narrow land-bridge connecting the headland to the mainland.

**Character:**
Technically outside the city proper but functionally part of it—the Neck Wall marks the city's only landward defense, and everything between the wall and the cliff-edge serves the military's needs.

Notable features:
- **The Neck Wall:** Thirty feet high, fifteen feet thick, with a single gate wide enough for two wagons to pass. The wall was built for siege warfare that never came—Wylltic raiders came by sea, not land.
- **The Training Yards:** Where marines and soldiers drill, where horses are exercised, where the young learn that service to the Shield means hardship before glory.
- **The Signal-Post:** First in the chain of signal towers that run along the coast. Messages can travel fifty miles in an hour on a clear day.
- **The Graves:** Beyond the wall, on the mainland side, lies the cemetery—generations of sailors, soldiers, and civilians. The headstones face the sea.

**Atmosphere:** Functional, military, and strangely peaceful. The Neck is where the city ends and the world begins. People come here to think, to mourn, to remember that beyond the wall lies everything else.

### Landmarks

#### The Admiral's Tower

The oldest structure on the headland, pre-dating even the hill-fort that the original Imperials found here. The lower courses are cyclopean—massive blocks fitted without mortar, in a style that belongs to no known tradition. Later builders simply added on top.

The signal-fire at its peak burns special oil rendered from sea-creature fat, producing a distinctive blue-tinged flame visible for miles. The fire-keepers say the flame has burned for three hundred years. Some say longer.

**The Current Mystery:** Since the Passing, the flame has occasionally flickered in patterns that seem almost deliberate. Admiral Blackwater has ordered detailed records kept. The patterns don't repeat, but they don't look random either.

#### The Great Chain

An engineering marvel from the Empire's height—hundreds of feet of iron chain, each link weighing more than a man, running from the Chain-House to an anchor-point on the opposite breakwater. When raised, the chain blocks the harbor entrance entirely.

The mechanism is maintained by a dedicated crew who practice raising it monthly. The chain has never been used in combat. But everyone agrees it's good to know it works.

**The Rumor:** Some of the older chain-keepers say the mechanism was originally designed to do something else—that the chain's true purpose wasn't keeping ships out, but keeping something in. They won't say what.

#### The Drowned God's Altar

At the base of the cliffs, accessible only at low tide, lies a natural sea-cave containing a crude stone altar worn smooth by centuries of waves. The Church officially denies its existence. The sailors know better.

Offerings are left here before particularly dangerous voyages—small things, personal things. Coins sometimes. Blood occasionally. The altar accepts everything and gives nothing visible in return. But ships that make the offering seem to come back more often than those that don't.

**What the Priests Don't Know:** The altar predates human presence on this coast. The carvings at its base are in no known script. Some sailors claim the carvings move during storms.

#### The Western Watch

The highest point of the Admiralty, above even the Admiral's Tower—a platform specifically for observing the western horizon. On clear days, patient observers claim they can see... something. Not Ynys Wyllt itself (too far, wrong angle), but something beyond the normal horizon.

Before the Passing, this was dismissed as mirages, wishful thinking, the effects of staring too long at waves. Since the Passing, the watchers have been seeing it more often. Still no one can describe what "it" is.

### Who Rules

**Admiral Caius Blackwater**

The last legitimately appointed commander of the Western Fleet, now de facto ruler of Dun Mara and much of the Western Shore. A career naval officer who never wanted political power and now can't avoid it.

Blackwater maintains the fiction that he's holding the city for the Emperor—whoever the Emperor turns out to be. In practice, he governs through the Fleet Council, a body of senior captains and civilian representatives that meets weekly to address whatever crisis presents itself.

His authority rests on:
- Control of the remaining fleet (twelve ships, down from forty)
- Personal respect from military and civilians alike
- The practical reality that no one else wants the job
- The ongoing mystery of what happened to Ynys Wyllt keeping everyone focused on external threat

### The Tension

Dun Mara faces a crisis of purpose.

For generations, the city existed to defend against Wylltic raiders. The Western Fleet patrolled these waters, repelled attacks, occasionally launched punitive expeditions to the Wild Isle. The rhythm was familiar: raids in summer, preparations in winter, eternal vigilance, occasional glory.

Then the Passing happened. And then the raids stopped.

Not gradually. Not through negotiation. The raids simply *stopped*. Ships that once harried this coast no longer appear. The signal-fires haven't reported a Wylltic sail in two years.

This should be good news. Instead, it's terrifying.

Admiral Blackwater has sent three scouting expeditions toward Ynys Wyllt. None have returned. Not lost to storms (the weather has been strangely calm). Not captured (no ransom demands). Simply... gone. Ships that sailed west and never came back.

The city is simultaneously preparing for an attack that might come at any moment and wondering if there's anyone left out there to attack them. The tension between these possibilities is eroding morale in ways that actual combat never did.

Meanwhile, to the east, the forest has closed. The road to Coedporth still functions, but travelers report that side-paths no longer lead where they should. The Kingswood is withdrawing, and no one knows what that means for the coast.

Dun Mara has always defined itself against threats. Without clear enemies, the city is struggling to remember who it is.

---

# Part Two: Secondary Settlements

## 1. Coedporth — The Forest-Port

**Imperial Name:** Portus Silvarum
**Local Name:** Coedporth ("Wood-Harbor")
**Location:** Where the Coillwynn River meets the western sea, approximately 80 miles south of Dun Mara

### Scale

| Period | Population | Notes |
|--------|------------|-------|
| Pre-Passing | 40,000 | Major timber trade, shipbuilding |
| Post-Passing | ~20,000 | Trade collapsed, population divided |

### Character

Coedporth was built on two economies: timber and ships. The Kingswood produced the finest shipbuilding wood in the Empire, floated down the Coillwynn to Coedporth's sawmills and shipyards. The city's vessels were legendary—heavy oak hulls, straight masts of ancient pine, all shaped by craftsmen who'd learned their trade from their parents who learned it from their parents.

Then the forest closed.

The Coillwynn still flows, but the logging camps upriver have gone silent. The last timber raft arrived eight months after the Passing. Since then, nothing. Scouts sent into the forest either come back confused (having walked in circles for days) or don't come back at all.

The city has split into two communities that barely speak to each other:

**The Sea-Folk** work the remaining shipyards (now doing repairs only, no new construction), fish the coastal waters, and maintain contact with Dun Mara. They've accepted that the forest is gone and are trying to build a future without it.

**The Forest-Folk** refuse to give up. They remember the old compact with the Kingswood—the prayers before cutting, the offerings at the ancient oaks, the relationship their ancestors maintained for generations. They believe the forest hasn't abandoned them; it's testing them. They wait at the forest's edge, making the old offerings, hoping to earn readmission.

### Notable Features

**The Silent Yards:** Three of the five great shipyards have closed. Their slipways stand empty, their sawpits fill with rainwater. The remaining two operate at quarter capacity on salvaged and traded timber.

**The Waiting Grove:** Just outside the city, where the forest-folk maintain a permanent camp at the treeline. They've built a rough shrine combining Solarian and Alysian elements, tended day and night. The forest doesn't respond, but they claim the trees are listening.

**The Governor's Dilemma:** Lady Morwen Riverside holds the Imperial governorship, inherited from her father. She's sympathetic to both factions but unable to unite them. Her authority weakens daily as she fails to resolve an irresolvable problem.

---

## 2. Aber Gwyn — The White River Mouth

**Imperial Name:** Ostium Albifluvii
**Local Name:** Aber Gwyn ("Mouth of the White River")
**Location:** Approximately 50 miles north of Dun Mara, where a chalk-bedded river meets the sea

### Scale

| Period | Population | Notes |
|--------|------------|-------|
| Pre-Passing | 8,000 | Fishing, local trade |
| Post-Passing | ~6,000 | Slight decline, relatively stable |

### Character

A quieter place than its neighbors—a fishing town that never aspired to be more. The White River carries chalk sediment from the Old Downs inland, giving the harbor a distinctive milky appearance and excellent fishing grounds where the fresh and salt waters mix.

Aber Gwyn's survival strategy has been invisibility. Too small to interest raiders, too poor to interest tax collectors, too unimportant to feature in anyone's plans. The Passing devastated larger places; Aber Gwyn simply continued as it always had, catching fish and minding its own business.

The town is notable for its **shrine to the Pale Lady**—officially Saint Alba of the Waters, but the locals know older names. Pregnant women come from up and down the coast to pray here. The chalk-water is said to ensure safe births.

### Notable Features

**The Chalk-Wives:** A sisterhood of women who tend the Pale Lady's shrine and serve as midwives throughout the Western Shore. They travel freely, respected by all factions, bound by oaths older than the Church.

**The White Harbor:** The milky water makes the harbor distinctive and creates practical problems—boats must be scrubbed constantly to prevent chalk buildup. But the unique chemistry also preserves wood against rot in ways that puzzle scholars.

**Master Idris Whitwater:** The town's informal leader, an elderly fisherman whose grandfather's grandfather supposedly received a blessing from the Pale Lady herself. He adjudicates disputes, sets fishing schedules, and maintains the peace through pure force of personality.

---

## 3. Traeth Hir — The Long Beach

**Imperial Name:** Litus Longum
**Local Name:** Traeth Hir ("Long Beach")
**Location:** Approximately 40 miles south of Coedporth, along a stretch of unusual coastline

### Scale

| Period | Population | Notes |
|--------|------------|-------|
| Pre-Passing | 12,000 | Trading post, seasonal market |
| Post-Passing | ~5,000 | Drastically reduced |

### Character

The name is descriptive: Traeth Hir sits on a five-mile stretch of flat sand—the only such beach on this rocky coast. Before the Passing, this made it valuable as a trading point. Ships too large for the minor harbors could anchor offshore and lighter goods to the beach. The summer markets here drew traders from up and down the coast and even occasional Wylltic merchants during periods of relative peace.

Now the beach serves a grimmer purpose.

This is where things wash up.

The currents along the western coast converge here, depositing whatever the sea decides to release. Driftwood. Wreckage. Occasionally bodies. Since the Passing, the beach has become a source of salvage and mystery in equal measure.

### Notable Features

**The Beachcombers' Guild:** Not an official guild but a local institution. The beachcombers have first rights to whatever washes ashore—a tradition so old it's written into the town's founding charter. They've become expert at identifying wreckage, and they keep detailed records of everything they find.

**The Wreck-Log:** Maintained by the Guild, documenting every significant piece of flotsam for the past two hundred years. Since the Passing, the log has recorded items that shouldn't exist: wood from no known tree, rope made from material no one can identify, a ship's wheel carved with symbols that make observers uncomfortable.

**The Hollow Market:** The summer trading fair has collapsed, but the infrastructure remains. The great marketplace stands empty most of the year, its stalls and warehouses slowly weathering. Some have been converted to homes; others shelter refugees from inland. The whole place has a haunted, waiting quality.

**Captain Sera Stormwrack:** The effective ruler, a former naval officer who retired here before the Passing and now organizes the town's defense and governance. She's intensely curious about what the beach has been producing and has sent detailed reports to Admiral Blackwater.

---

## 4. Ynys Goleuni — The Light Island

**Imperial Name:** Insula Luminis
**Local Name:** Ynys Goleuni ("Island of Light")
**Location:** A small island approximately 15 miles offshore from Dun Mara

### Scale

| Period | Population | Notes |
|--------|------------|-------|
| Pre-Passing | 200 | Lighthouse keepers, support staff |
| Post-Passing | ~80 | Reduced but functioning |

### Character

Not truly a settlement—more a permanent outpost serving a single purpose: the Great Lighthouse.

The Light Island stands at the point where coastal shipping must turn to navigate the headlands around Dun Mara. Without the lighthouse, ships would wreck on hidden rocks. The flame has guided vessels for as long as anyone remembers.

The lighthouse keepers are a breed apart. They live in near-isolation, supplied by monthly boats from Dun Mara. Families have maintained the Light for generations, developing their own traditions, their own rituals, their own way of seeing the world. They're considered slightly odd by mainlanders—too quiet, too watchful, too willing to talk about what they see from the lamp-room at night.

Since the Passing, the keepers have been sending increasingly strange reports. Lights on the western horizon that don't correspond to any known vessels. Sounds carrying across the water that might be voices. The feeling of being watched from the sea.

### Notable Features

**The Great Lighthouse:** A tower of white stone visible for twenty miles, its flame maintained by a rotation of keepers who work in shifts through the night. The lamp mechanism is ancient but reliable, burning the same blue-tinged oil as the Admiral's Tower.

**The Keeper's Lodge:** Living quarters for the keeper families, built to withstand storms that occasionally wash over the entire island. Generations of keepers have carved their names into the walls.

**The Warning Bell:** A massive bronze bell that sounds automatically in fog, driven by a clockwork mechanism of surprising sophistication. Sailors say the bell's tone has changed since the Passing—deeper, more mournful.

**Keeper-Elder Wynne Brightwater:** The senior keeper, seventy years old, born on the island, likely to die there. She's seen things she won't describe to outsiders but has written extensive private journals that she's promised to release "when the time is right."

---

# Part Three: Notable Sites

## 1. The Drowned Village (Pentref Bodd)

**Location:** Visible at extreme low tides, approximately 10 miles south of Dun Mara

**History:**
Local legend says that three hundred years ago, a village stood on what is now submerged ground. The villagers offended something—the exact offense varies with the telling—and the sea rose to claim them. One night, no storms, no warnings, the waters simply rose and the village disappeared.

Imperial scholars attributed this to natural land subsidence. The locals know better.

**Current State:**
At the lowest tides, stone foundations become visible beneath the waves. Fishermen avoid the area—their nets snag on ruins, and the fish caught here taste wrong. Occasionally, artifacts wash up at Traeth Hir that the beachcombers identify as coming from the Drowned Village: pottery in an old style, corroded metal tools, once a child's doll carved from bone.

**The Hook:**
Since the Passing, the village has been rising. Not dramatically—a few inches per year—but measurably. The foundations are more visible than they were. And divers who've explored the ruins report finding buildings that shouldn't exist: structures in styles that post-date the flooding. As if someone has been building down there, in the dark, in the cold.

---

## 2. The Screaming Caves (Ogofau Sgrech)

**Location:** Sea-caves at the base of cliffs, 25 miles north of Dun Mara

**History:**
A network of sea-caves famous—infamous—for the sounds they produce. When the wind blows from certain directions, the caves amplify and transform it into something that sounds uncannily like human screaming. The effect is natural, a product of acoustics, well-documented by Imperial engineers who mapped the cave system.

But even the engineers admitted the sound is disturbing beyond what physics should produce.

**Current State:**
The caves have always been avoided by sensible people. Since the Passing, the avoidance has become absolute. The screaming has changed. It's still wind-driven, still tied to weather patterns—but those who've heard it post-Passing swear the screams contain words now. Words in a language no one recognizes.

Local fishermen won't sail within a mile of the caves. A scientific expedition from Lexium was planned but abandoned when three of the scholars experienced night terrors so severe they fled the region entirely.

**The Hook:**
Despite the danger, someone is living in the caves. Lights have been seen at night—not firelight, something colder and steadier. The screaming, some say, now includes a second voice. As if whatever lives there has learned to answer.

---

## 3. The Wylltic Barrow (Crug y Gwyllt)

**Location:** Hilltop inland from Traeth Hir, visible from the beach

**History:**
An ancient burial mound that predates Imperial presence—possibly even predates human presence on this coast. Local tradition calls it Wylltic because the Wild Isle raiders were known to leave offerings here before major attacks, as if asking permission from whoever was buried within.

Imperial archaeologists never excavated it. The one team that tried experienced equipment failures, sudden illnesses, and finally a collapse that killed two workers. The Church declared the site "spiritually contaminated" and forbade further investigation.

**Current State:**
The barrow remains undisturbed, a grass-covered mound commanding views of the sea. Since the Wylltic raids stopped, so have the offerings. The hilltop feels empty in a way it didn't before—as if whatever presence accepted those offerings is waiting for their resumption.

Strange things have been seen near the barrow at night. Not ghosts exactly—more like spaces where the darkness is darker than it should be. Dogs won't approach the hill. Birds don't fly over it.

**The Hook:**
If Ynys Wyllt has fallen silent because something happened to its people, whoever lies in this barrow might know why. The raiders honored this site for generations—perhaps because they knew who was buried here. Perhaps because they knew what that being wanted. Perhaps because they knew what would happen if the offerings stopped.

---

## 4. The Broken Tower (Tŵr Toredig)

**Location:** Small island approximately 30 miles south of Ynys Goleuni, visible from shore

**History:**
Once a watchtower, part of the signal chain that connected the Western Shore to the rest of the Empire. The tower was struck by lightning during a storm forty years ago and never rebuilt—the island was too exposed, the logistics too difficult, and the signal chain was rerouted through inland posts.

The ruin has stood ever since, a landmark for fishermen, occasionally visited by curious sailors, generally ignored.

**Current State:**
Something has moved into the Broken Tower.

The first reports came from fishermen six months after the Passing: lights in the ruin at night, movement on the island during the day. Admiral Blackwater sent a patrol boat to investigate. They found the tower partially rebuilt—crude stonework filling the gap left by the lightning strike—and signs of habitation: fire-pits, bedding, stored food.

No inhabitants. The patrol waited three days but saw no one. When they returned to Dun Mara, they reported feeling watched the entire time.

Subsequent patrols have found the same pattern: evidence of occupation, but never occupants. The rebuilding continues between visits. Someone—or something—is slowly, patiently restoring the tower. The question is: to what purpose?

**The Hook:**
The tower's original signal mechanism was never recovered after the lightning strike. But recently, fishermen have reported seeing flashes from the island at night—not random firelight, but rhythmic, like signal-fire patterns. If someone is sending signals from the Broken Tower, who are they signaling to? And who—or what—might be receiving?

---

# Part Four: Key Figures

## 1. Admiral Caius Blackwater

**Role:** Commander of the Western Fleet, de facto ruler of Dun Mara and the Western Shore

**Appearance:**
Sixty-two years old, weathered by decades at sea, with the permanent squint of someone who's spent too long watching horizons. Silver hair cropped short. A scar across his left cheek from a Wylltic boarding action twenty years ago. Moves with the unconscious balance of a lifelong sailor.

**Character:**
Blackwater is competent, cautious, and quietly terrified. He's commanded ships in storms and battles; he's never commanded a city through an apocalypse. The responsibility weighs on him in ways he can't express.

He copes through routine. The fleet maintains schedules that haven't changed in decades, even though there's nothing to patrol against. Officers submit reports that no one reads. The signal towers pass messages that no one acts on. The structure provides comfort when the structure is all that's left.

Privately, Blackwater suspects something catastrophic has happened to Ynys Wyllt. He's lost three scouting expeditions trying to learn what. He won't send a fourth until he understands why the first three failed. This decision haunts him—if something threatens from the west, he needs to know. But he can't afford to keep losing ships and crews.

**Goal:**
Maintain order until someone arrives to relieve him of responsibility. Failing that, maintain order until he dies. Failing that, ensure someone competent takes over.

**Complication:**
His competence has made him indispensable. No one else wants command. The longer he holds power, the harder it becomes to imagine relinquishing it. He's becoming exactly the kind of strongman he's always distrusted.

**Quote:**
"The sea doesn't care about our politics. Neither do I, frankly. But the sea hasn't learned to lie yet. I wish I could say the same for people."

---

## 2. Lady Morwen Riverside

**Role:** Governor of Coedporth, heir to a generations-old administrative position

**Appearance:**
Forty-five, with the dark hair and grey eyes common to old Kingswood families. Dresses practically—riding clothes rather than noble finery—and usually has sawdust or bark somewhere on her person from visiting the waiting-folk at the forest's edge.

**Character:**
Morwen inherited a thriving timber port; she now governs a divided town slowly collapsing into irrelevance. She's intelligent enough to understand the situation and too proud to abandon her responsibilities.

She splits her time between the sea-folk (who want her to accept the forest's closure and build a new economy) and the forest-folk (who want her to support their vigil and trust that the Kingswood will reopen). She sympathizes with both. She can satisfy neither.

Her private belief, shared with no one, is that the forest-folk might be right. She's had dreams since the Passing—dreams of walking the old paths, dreams of voices in the trees, dreams that feel like invitations. But she's also had dreams of the forest consuming everything, of Coedporth swallowed by roots and leaves, of her people scattered like fallen seeds.

**Goal:**
Find a way to unite her community before it tears itself apart. Discover what the forest actually wants—if it wants anything at all.

**Complication:**
Both factions are beginning to see her neutrality as weakness. The sea-folk whisper about replacing her with someone decisive. The forest-folk worry she's lost faith in the old compact. She's losing authority daily.

**Quote:**
"My family has governed this town for nine generations. We survived raids and plagues and three civil wars. But those were enemies we could understand. How do you negotiate with silence? How do you fight an absence?"

---

## 3. The Stranger (Name Unknown)

**Role:** Mysterious figure recently arrived in the region, identity and purpose unknown

**Appearance:**
Variable, according to reports. Sometimes an old woman with sea-wrack in her hair. Sometimes a young man with fog-colored eyes. Sometimes nothing visible at all—just a voice from behind, a presence felt but not seen. The one consistent detail: the smell of salt and depth, like the breath of a deep-sea cave.

**Character:**
The Stranger appeared on the Western Shore three months ago. They've been seen in Dun Mara, Coedporth, Aber Gwyn, and Traeth Hir—sometimes on the same day, impossibly far apart. They ask questions: about the old traditions, about the barrow, about what people remember of the time before the Empire.

Those who've spoken with the Stranger report a sense of being evaluated—tested, perhaps, though for what they can't say. The conversations are unsettling but not hostile. The Stranger seems genuinely curious about these people and this place.

The Church wants the Stranger found and questioned. Admiral Blackwater wants the Stranger found and watched. The forest-folk believe the Stranger is a messenger from the Kingswood. The fishermen think the Stranger is Fae. No one has successfully detained or tracked the Stranger.

**Goal:**
Unknown. The Stranger asks questions but gives no answers. They're looking for something, or someone, or some answer to a question no one else knows to ask.

**Complication:**
The Stranger may be exactly what this coast needs—a connection to whatever powers might help. Or the Stranger may be something drawn by the chaos, something that feeds on uncertainty. The not-knowing is perhaps the most dangerous thing about them.

**Quote (attributed, unconfirmed):**
"Your ancestors made promises. Promises don't expire just because you forgot them. Something is coming to collect."

# Part Five: Local Conditions

## The Reft Situation

**Density:** Low to Moderate
**Primary Types:** Drowned Reft, Root Reft, Shadow Reft

The Western Shore has fewer Reft than most regions—the pre-Passing population was smaller, and the tight-knit coastal communities organized defenses quickly. But the Reft that exist are distinctive.

**Drowned Reft** are the most common: victims whose souls were displaced by Atargatan (Depths) field energy. They move slowly, relentlessly, and are drawn to water. They've been found standing in the surf, walking into the sea, floating face-down in harbors. They drown victims by simply pulling them under and holding on.

**Root Reft** cluster near the forest's edge, where the Alysian (Land) field is strongest. They don't wander—they stake out territory and defend it. Most are concentrated in the buffer zone between Coedporth and the Kingswood. The forest-folk have learned to give them wide berth.

**Shadow Reft** appear occasionally, usually in the caves and ruins along the coast. The Revnan (Dark) field influences them toward ambush tactics. They're rare but dangerous—you don't see them coming.

**Notable Pattern:**
No Reft have been found on Ynys Goleuni or the other offshore islands. The lighthouse keepers speculate that something about the isolation, or the Light itself, provides protection. This theory hasn't been tested.

## Travel

**Coastal Route:** The main path connects all settlements along the shore. Before the Passing, this was a well-maintained road with regular patrols. Now it's surviving on accumulated maintenance, increasingly dangerous at night, but still the primary route.

**Sea Travel:** Often safer than land, especially for longer distances. The reduced fleet still provides escort for essential shipping. Fishing boats can carry passengers between settlements. The currents are well-mapped and the local sailors know them intimately.

**Forest Routes:** Effectively closed. The Kingswood no longer permits passage. Attempts to cut new paths fail—trails that were cleared yesterday are overgrown today.

**The Signal Chain:** Still operational for urgent messages. The towers are undermanned but functional. Messages from Dun Mara to Coedporth take about four hours in good weather.

## Trade

**Exports (Pre-Passing):**
- Timber (gone)
- Ships and ship-repair services (reduced)
- Salted fish (maintained)
- Chalk products from Aber Gwyn (maintained)

**Imports (Pre-Passing):**
- Grain from the Heartland (severely reduced)
- Metal goods (severely reduced)
- Luxury items (effectively gone)

**Current State:**
The Western Shore is becoming economically isolated. Without timber to export, there's little to trade. Fish provides protein but not bargaining power. The region is learning self-sufficiency because it has no choice.

The Beachcombers' Guild at Traeth Hir has become unexpectedly important—salvage from the shore provides materials otherwise unavailable. There's quiet competition among settlements to recruit skilled beachcombers.

## Religion

**Official Religion:** The Solarian Church maintains nominal presence in all settlements except Ynys Goleuni (too small to support a priest).

**Actual Practice:** A complex syncretism that the Church pretends not to notice.

The coastal population never fully converted. They worship the Light at official services but make offerings to older powers—Manannán of the seas, the Pale Lady of Aber Gwyn, spirits of headland and harbor. The Church tolerates this because attempting suppression would be futile and dangerous.

Since the Passing, the older practices have grown more open. People want gods who answer, not institutions that make pronouncements. The sailors have always known which prayers work at sea. Now they're less shy about saying so.

**The Forest-Folk** at Coedporth practice Alysian tradition openly, complete with offerings and seasonal rituals. They're waiting for the Kingswood to acknowledge them, and they'll follow whatever protocols might earn that acknowledgment.

**The Chalk-Wives** of Aber Gwyn represent a tradition older than either Church or Alysian practice—something specific to this coast, possibly connected to the Shio-Gatis (tide-changed peoples) who once lived here.

## The Scars

**The Drowned Village:** See Notable Sites. The rising ruins represent a slow-motion Scar, something wounded in the fabric of reality that's gradually healing wrong.

**The Screaming Caves:** See Notable Sites. The changed quality of the screams suggests realm-field damage, possibly Revnan (Dark) or Abyss contamination.

**The Western Silence:** Not a visible Scar but perhaps the most significant wound. Something happened to Ynys Wyllt, and whatever it was has left an absence that people can feel. The western horizon feels wrong—not dangerous exactly, but empty in a way that living horizon shouldn't be.

# Part Six: Adventure Hooks

## 1. The Fourth Expedition

Admiral Blackwater has finally decided to send another scouting mission to Ynys Wyllt—but he needs volunteers, and he needs a different approach. The three lost expeditions all followed standard naval procedure. This one needs to be different.

**The Mission:** Travel to the Wild Isle, determine what happened, and return with information. Not rescue survivors (there may not be any), not establish contact (there may be no one to contact)—just learn the truth and come back to report it.

**The Complication:** Blackwater suspects the previous expeditions failed because they approached wrong. The Wylltic always honored the barrow before crossing—perhaps approaching without that observance is what got the scouts killed. He needs someone willing to investigate the old rituals and potentially perform them.

**The Mystery:** What actually happened to Ynys Wyllt? The possibilities range from plague to civil war to supernatural catastrophe to something worse than anyone imagines.

---

## 2. The Beachcomber's Discovery

The salvage teams at Traeth Hir have found something troubling: wreckage from an Imperial ship that shouldn't exist. The vessel's registry indicates it was decommissioned fifty years ago and broken up for timber. Yet here are pieces of its hull, still bearing the original markings, washing up on the Long Beach.

**The Mission:** Investigate the wreckage's origin. Track the currents backward if possible. Determine where this impossible flotsam is coming from.

**The Complication:** Other impossible wreckage has appeared too—pieces from ships lost decades ago, artifacts in styles that predate the Empire. Something in the sea is releasing things that should stay lost.

**The Mystery:** Is this connected to the Drowned Village's rising? To whatever happened at Ynys Wyllt? To the Ivy creeping through the Atargatan realm? The sea connects everything—what does it know that it's trying to tell?

---

## 3. The Forest's Message

The forest-folk at Coedporth have made contact—they think. One of their vigil-keepers, a young woman named Brin, has begun speaking in her sleep. The words aren't her native language but something older. Another keeper has started translating—she doesn't know how she knows, but the meaning comes to her.

**The Mission:** Investigate Brin's utterances, determine if they're genuine contact with the Kingswood, and if so, learn what the forest wants.

**The Complication:** The messages are demanding. The forest seems to want something returned—something that was taken long ago, something the forest-folk don't remember losing. Finding it may require delving into histories that the Church worked hard to suppress.

**The Mystery:** What did the old compact between humans and Kingswood actually involve? What obligations did ancestors incur that descendants must honor? And what happens if those obligations can't be met?

---

## 4. The Stranger's Questions

The mysterious Stranger has taken an interest in your party. They appear unexpectedly, ask pointed questions about your histories and intentions, and disappear before you can ask questions in return. After three such encounters, a pattern emerges: the Stranger is testing you for something.

**The Mission:** Figure out what the Stranger wants and decide whether to cooperate. Track them if possible, though others have failed. Determine if they're threat, ally, or something else entirely.

**The Complication:** The Stranger knows things they shouldn't—family secrets, childhood memories, promises made and forgotten. They're not reading minds exactly, but they have access to information that should be private.

**The Mystery:** The Stranger is asking about promises. Old promises, made to powers that predate human presence on this coast. Someone made commitments that bind their descendants. The Stranger may be here to enforce them—or to offer a way out.

---

## 5. The Tower's Signal

Fishermen have confirmed that the Broken Tower is signaling. The flashes follow a pattern too regular to be natural. Someone has restored the old signal mechanism and is using it to communicate.

**The Mission:** Travel to the Broken Tower, determine who's there and what they're saying, and decide what to do about it.

**The Complication:** The signal's recipients may be more important than the senders. If someone is signaling toward Ynys Wyllt, they may know something about what happened there. Alternatively, they may be trying to reach something that everyone else would prefer stayed unreachable.

**The Mystery:** Three possibilities present themselves: survivors from the Wild Isle trying to communicate with their homeland, something from the mainland trying to contact whatever remains on Ynys Wyllt, or something worse—entities neither human nor Wylltic using the tower for their own purposes.
