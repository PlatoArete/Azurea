# Azurea: The Pinelands (Barrskogar)
## Sub-Region Development Document

---

# Overview

**Region:** The North (Provincia Borealis / Norðmark)
**Sub-Region:** The Pinelands (Regio Silvae Borealis / Barrskogar)
**Meaning:** "Needle-Forest" — referring to the vast conifer forests
**Capital:** Holmgard
**City Density:** Low — approximately 180 miles between major settlements

## Character Summary

The Pinelands is an immense territory of dark conifer forest stretching between the Axis Mountains and the northern coast. Rivers thread through the endless trees like veins, carrying timber from the interior to market towns and eventually to shipyards along the coast. The people here are sparse, hardy, and stubbornly independent — they came to the forest because they wanted to be left alone, and the forest obliged.

Unlike the High Marches with their dwarven alliances or the Fjordlands with their maritime culture, the Pinelands have always been the Empire's blind spot. Too remote to garrison effectively, too poor to tax profitably, too forested to farm conventionally. The Church sent missionaries; the forest swallowed them. The Empire sent tax collectors; they returned empty-handed or not at all. Eventually, both institutions learned to accept token acknowledgment and leave the Pinelands to their own devices.

This benign neglect has proven to be the region's salvation.

**The Pinelands Paradox:** The Passing devastated the civilized world, but the Pinelands barely noticed. Their scattered communities, already designed around isolation and self-sufficiency, simply continued as they always had. The forest that the Empire considered a liability turned out to be the greatest asset imaginable — the Reft wander the open roads and cluster in abandoned cities, but they struggle with trackless wilderness. The hunting skills that kept families fed for generations now keep the dead at bay.

# Part One: The Capital — Holmgard

## Names and Meaning

**Imperial Name:** Holmgardium
**Local Name:** Holmgard (HOLM-gard)
**Meaning:** "Island-Fort" — the city is built on a river island
**Common Epithets:** "The Timber Throne," "Heart of the Pines," "The Raft-City"

## Location

Holmgard occupies a large island in the Svartelv ("Black River"), approximately two-thirds of the way from the Axis Mountains to the coast. The island is roughly two miles long and half a mile wide, formed where the river splits around an outcropping of bedrock before rejoining downstream.

**Strategic Position:**
- Controls the main timber-floating route from interior to coast
- At the junction of three major forest trails
- Far enough from mountains to avoid dwarven politics
- Far enough from coast to avoid Wylltic raids
- Central enough to serve as regional market

**The Rivers:**
The Svartelv is the region's great highway. From Holmgard:
- **Upstream:** Leads to the mountain foothills and the old-growth groves
- **Downstream:** Leads to Strömsby and eventually the Fjordlands coast
- **The Hvitelv ("White River"):** Joins from the east, providing access to the eastern forest reaches

## Scale

**Pre-Passing Population:** ~12,000
**Post-Passing Population:** ~9,000

The population has actually *increased* slightly since the Passing, as refugees from destroyed communities downstream have migrated to Holmgard's relative safety. However, many newcomers live in temporary camps on the mainland rather than on the island proper.

## The Island City

### The Raft-Districts

Holmgard is famous for its unique construction. The island itself holds only the oldest and most permanent structures. The rest of the city floats.

**Raft-Houses:** Buildings constructed on massive log platforms, anchored to the island's shores or to each other. They rise and fall with seasonal water levels, shift position as needed, and can be (slowly) relocated. A Holmgard address is not a location but a *relationship* — "third raft downstream of the Jarl's Hall" or "the blue roof beside the fish-market platform."

**The Floating Districts:**

| District | Character | Notable Features |
|----------|-----------|------------------|
| **The Stone (Steinen)** | The island proper; oldest buildings, government, temples | Jarl's Hall, the Stone Temple, the Ancient Oak |
| **The Upstream Rafts** | Wealthier merchants, master craftsmen | Fine timber construction, rope bridges to Stone |
| **The Downstream Rafts** | Markets, common housing, transient population | The Great Market-Raft, taverns, boarding houses |
| **The Mill-Rafts** | Sawmills powered by river current | Loud, busy, essential; workers' housing |
| **The Boom-Yards** | Log sorting and storage | Massive floating corrals holding timber awaiting sale |

### Landmarks

**The Jarl's Hall (Jarlshallen)**
The largest wooden building in the North. Three stories of massive timber construction, with carved dragon-heads on the gables (a deliberate irony — the North has no dragons). The great hall can seat five hundred for feasting. The structure is over three centuries old, its timbers black with age and smoke.

*Current Resident:* Jarl Sigrun Deeproot, a woman in her sixties who inherited the position through a complicated series of deaths and marriages and has held it for thirty years through sheer competence.

**The Stone Temple (Steinshof)**
The only stone structure on the island, built by Axis Faith missionaries centuries ago. Originally a temple to the Meeting Point theology, it was nominally converted to Solarian use when the Church claimed the region. In practice, the Church never sent enough priests to matter, and the temple has always served whatever faith the locals preferred.

*Current State:* The temple serves triple duty — Axis Faith ceremonies for those who follow it, basic Solarian rites for the handful who care, and community gathering space for everyone. The priest is an elderly man named Brother Aldmar who believes in "keeping the gods' peace" more than doctrinal purity.

**The Ancient Oak (Gámaleikrinn)**
In the center of the island stands a massive oak tree, wildly out of place among the conifers. Local tradition holds it was planted by the first settlers — an act of defiance, bringing a lowland tree to the pine forest. It shouldn't survive this far north, but it does. It *thrives*.

*Local Belief:* The Oak is the heart of Holmgard. As long as it stands, the city stands. Some whisper it's a Forest Elf sleeping upright, or a land-spirit made wood, or one of the original trees from before the Eldest Sister's time. The truth is unknown. What's known is that the oak has survived three major fires, two floods, and the Passing without apparent harm.

**The Great Market-Raft (Markaðsfleki)**
The largest floating platform in the city — nearly an acre of connected rafts forming a permanent marketplace. Merchants pay for the right to anchor here; the positions closer to the Stone command higher prices. On market days, the entire raft-complex is packed with traders, trappers, and townspeople.

**The Boom-Master's Tower**
A tall wooden tower on the downstream point of the island, overlooking the boom-yards where timber awaits sale. From here, the Boom-Master (a powerful appointed position) oversees the log trade, settles disputes, and maintains the accounting that makes Holmgard's economy function.

### Atmosphere

**Sounds:** The constant rush of the river. The creak of rope and timber as rafts shift. The rhythmic thunk of sawmills. Voices carrying across water. Occasional splash of someone falling in (it happens often; Holmgard children learn to swim before they walk).

**Smells:** Pine resin. Sawdust. Wood smoke. Fish from the river. The particular scent of wet timber that never quite dries.

**Sights:** Everything is wood — dark timber, pale fresh-cut planks, weathered grey boards, bark shingles. Color comes from painted shutters (red, blue, yellow) and from the goods in market stalls. The river is dark and fast-moving, carrying bark and sawdust. In morning, mist rises from the water and wraps the city in grey.

**The Feeling:** Holmgard feels like a city that shouldn't exist but does anyway — a stubborn assertion of human presence in endless wilderness. There's pride here, and practicality, and a certain dark humor about their situation. "The forest wants us dead," goes a local saying, "but it hasn't managed yet."

## Who Rules

### The Formal Structure

**The Jarl:** Holmgard is technically ruled by a Jarl — a position that predates Imperial contact and never fully translated to Imperial terminology. The Jarl is not quite a duke, not quite a chieftain, not quite a mayor. The position combines judicial, military, and ceremonial functions.

*Method of Selection:* Theoretically hereditary, practically confirmed by the Thing (assembly of free citizens). A Jarl who loses the Thing's confidence may be "encouraged" to retire.

**The Thing (Þingið):** Assembly of all free adult citizens, meeting four times yearly to decide major issues. Day-to-day governance is delegated to the Jarl and appointed officials, but significant decisions — war, major construction, changes to law — require Thing approval.

**The Boom-Master (Bómmeistari):** Controls timber trade. Appointed by the Jarl, confirmed by the Thing. Enormous practical power because controlling the logs means controlling the economy.

### The Actual Power

**Jarl Sigrun Deeproot** is the most capable leader Holmgard has had in generations, which is why she's survived thirty years in a position that killed three predecessors. She's:
- A former logger herself (unusual for nobility)
- Married and widowed twice, both husbands dying in accidents she had nothing to do with (probably)
- Mother of six, grandmother of fifteen
- Absolutely unimpressed by anyone's status or threats
- Genuinely beloved by common folk for her fairness

*Her Strategy:* Keep Holmgard independent, fed, and armed. Don't get involved in southern politics. Make the forest work for them rather than against them. Prepare for a long winter that might last years.

**Boom-Master Thorvald Iron-Count** controls the timber economy with an accountant's precision and a miser's grip. He's:
- Brilliant with numbers (possibly the best mathematician in the North)
- Personally unpleasant (few friends, many enemies)
- Absolutely essential (nobody else can manage the log-trade)
- Loyal to Sigrun (she gave him the position when no one else would)

*His Concern:* The downstream markets are collapsing. Who will buy timber when there's no one left to build? He's quietly exploring alternative uses for wood — charcoal for forges, wood-gas experiments, anything that maintains Holmgard's economic purpose.

## The Tension

**The Refugee Problem**

Since the Passing, survivors from downstream communities have been making their way to Holmgard — the only functioning city in the Pinelands. Some are skilled woodworkers or trappers; they integrate easily. Others are farmers, merchants, or scholars with no forest skills; they struggle.

The refugees camp on the mainland shores, forming shanty-towns that Holmgard natives view with unease. The camps are:
- Outside the city's traditional boundaries
- Not governed by city law
- Potentially full of people who might be early-stage Reft
- Definitely full of hungry mouths with limited means to feed themselves

**The Factions:**

| Faction | Position | Leader |
|---------|----------|--------|
| **The Openers** | Integrate refugees, expand the city | Master-Builder Hrefna Raftwife |
| **The Holders** | Maintain current population, limit entry | Elder Gunnar Stone-Born |
| **The Jarl's Position** | Cautious integration, testing and patience | Jarl Sigrun |

The tension hasn't become violence yet, but a bad winter or a Reft outbreak in the camps could change that.

**The Religious Question**

The Church never had real power here, but it had *presence* — priests, a cathedral in the downstream towns (now destroyed), nominal authority. That's all gone now. Which raises questions:

- Does Holmgard owe anything to the Church? To the Empire?
- Should the old ways (Axis Faith, forest-spirits, ancestor veneration) return openly?
- What about refugees who are genuinely devout Solarians?

Brother Aldmar keeps the peace through a combination of genuine tolerance and tactical ambiguity. But he's old, and when he dies, someone will need to decide what Holmgard actually believes.

# Part Two: Secondary Settlements

## Strömsby — The River's End

**Imperial Name:** Fluvii Terminus
**Local Name:** Strömsby (STREM-boo)
**Meaning:** "Stream's Village" — where the Svartelv becomes navigable by larger vessels
**Type:** River port, transshipment point
**Population:** Pre-Passing ~4,000 / Post-Passing ~2,500

### Character

Strömsby sits where the Svartelv emerges from the deep forest and the riverbed widens enough for coastal ships to navigate. For centuries, this made it the critical link in the timber trade — logs floated downstream to Strömsby, were assembled into rafts or loaded onto ships, and continued to the coast.

The town is built on both riverbanks, connected by a bridge famous for being rebuilt seven times after floods, fires, and one memorable incident involving a wayward log-raft. The current bridge (number eight) is stone on wooden pilings, the only stone structure in town.

**The Economy:** Transshipment. Everything going downstream becomes cargo here; everything going upstream becomes pack-loads. Strömsby lives on the difference between river transport and overland/coastal transport.

### Notable Feature: The Ship-Graves

Upstream from the town, in a bend of the river, dozens of old longships have been hauled ashore and arranged in rows. They're too old to sail but too sacred to burn. Each ship has a name and a story; the oldest predate Imperial contact. Local families maintain specific ships associated with their ancestors.

*Post-Passing Development:* Since the Passing, several ships have been observed to *move* — shifting position slightly overnight, as if restless. The dead sailors buried beneath some of them have been seen standing on decks in moonlight. The locals don't find this alarming. "They're keeping watch," one elder explained. "Good to know someone is."

### Current State

Strömsby was hit harder than Holmgard by the Passing — more exposed, closer to the coast where the plague struck first. Roughly a third of the population died or turned Reft. The survivors have grimly continued, burning what needed burning, burying what needed burying.

**Who Rules:** Harbor-Master Bjørn Keel-Walker, a former ship captain who took charge when no one else would. He's kept order through a combination of nautical discipline and genuine concern for his people.

**The Tension:** Strömsby depends on trade. Trade depends on there being something to trade *with*. The coastal markets are devastated; the Fjordlands are struggling. Bjørn is desperately trying to establish new trade routes — perhaps with Holmgard taking a more active role, perhaps with distant survivors they haven't contacted yet.

---

## Djupdal — The Deep Valley

**Imperial Name:** Vallis Profunda
**Local Name:** Djupdal (YOOP-dahl)
**Meaning:** "Deep Valley" — the settlement occupies a valley cut deep between forested ridges
**Type:** Logging camp, administrative center for eastern forests
**Population:** Pre-Passing ~1,500 / Post-Passing ~800

### Character

Djupdal exists because the trees here are enormous. The eastern reaches of the Pinelands hold the oldest old-growth forest — conifers three hundred feet tall, trunks wider than houses, wood dense and strong and valuable beyond measure. Djupdal grew up as the base camp for logging these giants.

The town is utilitarian: bunkhouses for loggers, warehouses for equipment, a hall where contracts are negotiated and disputes settled. No one comes to Djupdal for its beauty. They come because this is where the best timber in the world meets the system that harvests it.

**The Logging Guilds:** Three hereditary guilds control the eastern forests:
- **The Fellers** — cut the trees
- **The Splitters** — process logs into transportable sections
- **The Drivers** — move timber via river

Each guild jealously guards its privileges and expertise. Inter-guild rivalries are legendary and occasionally bloody.

### Notable Feature: The Cathedral Grove

Half a day's journey from Djupdal lies a grove that has never been logged. The trees here are the oldest in the Pinelands — possibly the oldest on the continent. Some say they're remnants of Alys's original hair, or that they grew before the Eldest Sister became the world-tree.

**The Prohibition:** An ancient compact forbids logging the Cathedral Grove. The exact terms are disputed — some say it was a deal with forest-spirits, others claim it was a practical decision to maintain seed-stock. What's certain is that anyone who's tried to cut Cathedral Grove timber has died within a year. Usually in logging accidents. Plausible accidents. Very specific accidents.

### Current State

Djupdal has contracted but survived. The Passing reduced the workforce, and there's less demand for timber anyway. But the remaining loggers continue their work — partly because it's what they know, partly because Holmgard still needs timber, partly because stopping feels like surrender.

**Who Rules:** Guild-Mother Yrsa Three-Fingers (she lost two to a saw; it's considered good luck in the Fellers' guild). She holds the rare position of respect in all three guilds and mediates their endless disputes.

**The Tension:** Young loggers are leaving for Holmgard. The eastern forest camps are closing. Djupdal might shrink to nothing within a generation — or might reinvent itself as something other than a logging town. Yrsa is exploring alternatives: charcoal production, the Cathedral Grove's pilgrimage potential, even converting to a refuge for survivors who want isolation.

## Tóftirnar — The Ruins-Settlement

**Imperial Name:** Ruinae Boreales
**Local Name:** Tóftirnar (TOHF-tir-nar)
**Meaning:** "The House-Ruins" — built among pre-Imperial stone foundations
**Type:** Trapping hub, fur-trade center
**Population:** Pre-Passing ~600 / Post-Passing ~350

### Character

Tóftirnar sits in a forest clearing where ancient stone foundations have weathered since before recorded history. No one knows who built them — they're not dwarven, not Fae, not any style the historians recognize. The current settlement uses the foundations but builds in wood above them; the stone is too heavy and too hard to work.

The trappers of Tóftirnar range through the northern forests, bringing back furs for the markets in Holmgard and beyond. They know the deep forest better than anyone — the trails no map shows, the clearings where animals gather, the places humans shouldn't go.

**The Trade:** Furs, hides, and forest products that can't be obtained closer to civilization. Pine-nuts gathered by the barrel. Medicinal herbs. Amber from ancient trees. And occasionally, things found in the forest that shouldn't be spoken of in polite company.

### Notable Feature: The Whispering Foundations

The ancient stones *whisper*. Not always, not predictably, but on certain nights — winter solstice, equinoxes, during storms — the foundations produce sounds. Not quite voices. Not quite wind. Something between. The locals have learned which foundations whisper comfortingly and which whisper *wrong*. They build on the comfortable ones.

*Scholarly Speculation:* Some Lexium academics (before the Passing) theorized the foundations were built by the "First Peoples" — whatever existed before humans, before the migrations, possibly before the God-Giant War. The whispers might be echoes of their language. Or their ghosts. Or something else entirely.

### Current State

Tóftirnar's isolation, which was always its weakness economically, has become its strength. The Reft don't find their way here. The Passing barely touched the settlement directly — they lost people to supply chain collapse more than plague.

**Who Rules:** Elder Ketil Whisperer, who claims descent from the original settlers and certainly knows more about the foundations than anyone else. His "rulings" are as much divination as law — he listens to the stones before deciding cases.

**The Tension:** Tóftirnar has always traded with Holmgard. But the trade routes are dangerous now, and the trappers increasingly wonder if they need the outside world at all. Some advocate complete isolation — closing the settlement, letting the forest hide them entirely, waiting out the age of chaos. Others argue that cutting ties means slow death through inbreeding and resource depletion.

---

## Vakttårn — The Watch-Tower

**Imperial Name:** Turris Vigiliae
**Local Name:** Vakttårn (VAHKT-torn)
**Meaning:** "Watch-Tower" — originally a military outpost
**Type:** Fortified village, border station
**Population:** Pre-Passing ~400 / Post-Passing ~250

### Character

Vakttårn guards the pass between the Pinelands and the Fjordlands. The original tower was Imperial — a lonely outpost maintaining nominal authority over roads that barely existed. Over centuries, a village grew around it: families of soldiers, then merchants serving travelers, then people who just wanted to live somewhere defensible.

The tower still stands, five stories of timber reinforced with stone foundations. It's the tallest structure in the Pinelands outside Holmgard, and on clear days, you can see the mountains from its peak.

**The Pass:** The Hvitpasset ("White Pass") is the main route between Pinelands and Fjordlands. Not a mountain pass — the Pinelands and Fjordlands share the same lowland — but a natural corridor through particularly difficult terrain. Control Vakttårn, control the corridor.

### Notable Feature: The Beacon System

Vakttårn maintains a network of beacon-towers stretching from here to Holmgard and from here to Fjordhavn. In theory, a fire lit at any beacon can alert the whole network within hours. In practice, several beacons have been abandoned since the Passing, and the system has gaps.

*Recent Development:* Watch-Captain Astrid has been systematically reoccupying abandoned beacons, sending small teams to light them and report back. The network is slowly being restored — not for Imperial communication (the Empire is functionally dead) but for regional mutual defense.

### Current State

Vakttårn has become more important since the Passing, not less. The village is one of few points of contact between the surviving communities in the Pinelands and those in the Fjordlands. News, refugees, and occasional trade all flow through here.

**Who Rules:** Watch-Captain Astrid Beacon-Light, daughter of the previous captain, who inherited command when he died of a fever (natural causes — rare and almost suspicious in its ordinariness). She's young, capable, and intensely focused on one goal: making sure that if something bad comes from either direction, everyone else knows about it.

**The Tension:** Vakttårn is caught between two regions that are increasingly looking inward. The Fjordlands have their own problems; the Pinelands are developing their own identity. Astrid believes in connection — that isolated communities will die while connected ones might survive — but she's increasingly alone in that belief.

---

# Part Three: Notable Sites

## The Svartmyr — The Black Mire

**Type:** Geographic hazard, haunted site
**Location:** Central Pinelands, along a tributary of the Svartelv

### Description

A vast peat bog stretching miles through the forest. The Svartmyr ("Black Mire") has swallowed travelers, livestock, and at least two logging expeditions throughout history. The water is black with tannins, the footing is treacherous, and the mire has a reputation for *not giving back what it takes*.

### The Preserved

The bog preserves what it swallows. Bodies have been recovered centuries after death, perfectly preserved, looking as if they died yesterday. Some of these "bog-people" predate human settlement; their clothing and tools match nothing in the historical record.

Since the Passing, the Svartmyr has begun *returning* some of its dead. Not as Reft — as something else. Perfectly preserved figures walking out of the mire, looking confused, speaking languages no one recognizes. They don't seem hostile. They don't seem to understand where they are. They wander until they collapse, and then they don't rise again.

### The Hook

The bog-walkers carry artifacts from before recorded history. Some of these artifacts are clearly valuable — tools of unknown metal, jewelry of uncertain purpose. More importantly, some seem to be *maps* — representations of a world configured differently than the present. If the maps could be understood, they might reveal things buried since before the migrations.

But retrieving artifacts means entering the Svartmyr. And the Svartmyr doesn't let go easily.

---

## The Grandfather Trees

**Type:** Sacred grove, potential threat
**Location:** Scattered throughout the deep forest

### Description

Individual trees of impossible age and size, scattered through the Pinelands like monuments. Each Grandfather Tree is a local landmark — navigation point, meeting place, object of veneration. Some have been named and celebrated for centuries: the Iron-Pine, the Sky-Reacher, the Thousand-Branch.

The trees are undeniably *present* in a way ordinary trees are not. People speak of feeling watched near them. Animals behave strangely in their shadows. Time seems to pass differently within their influence.

### The Network

Local wise-folk have long believed the Grandfather Trees are connected — roots intertwining deep underground, forming a forest-wide network of awareness. Whether this is literally true or merely poetically true is unclear. What's clear is that when one Grandfather Tree is harmed, others react: branches fall in distant groves, animals flee, the forest seems to *hold its breath*.

Since the Passing, the Grandfather Trees have become more active. They groan at night, even without wind. Their branches have been observed moving. In one documented case, a tree that had stood unchanged for centuries suddenly produced fruit — massive pine-cones containing seeds the size of fists. What those seeds might grow into, no one has dared to test.

### The Hook

Someone is approaching the Grandfather Trees. Leaving offerings. Performing rituals. The trees are responding — but to what end? Is someone awakening the forest's consciousness? Trying to communicate with something ancient? Or is this the first sign of the forest deciding that humanity has been tolerated long enough?

---

## Urdarbrun — The Well of Fate

**Type:** Sacred spring, prophetic site
**Location:** Northern Pinelands, in a clearing that shouldn't exist

### Description

A spring emerging from between the roots of an enormous, long-dead tree. The water is cold, clear, and supposedly shows visions to those who drink it. The clearing around the spring is perfectly circular, the trees at its edge unnaturally straight, as if arranged rather than grown.

**Pre-Passing:** Urdarbrun was a pilgrimage site for those seeking prophecy. The Axis Faith associated it with the fate-weaving aspect of their tradition; local wise-women used it for divination. The Church officially condemned it as pagan superstition but couldn't find it to destroy it — the clearing moves, or seems to, appearing in different locations to different seekers.

### The Visions

The well's visions are not comfortable. They show what *will* happen, not what the seeker wants to happen. Worse, they show the cost of preventing what will happen — the ripples of interference spreading outward. Those who drink and see often wish they hadn't.

Since the Passing, the visions have become darker. Seekers report seeing the world *ending* — not through fire or flood, but through dissolution, reality becoming uncertain, boundaries failing. The dead tree above the spring has begun to bloom with impossible flowers.

### The Hook

A figure has taken up residence near Urdarbrun. An old woman who may have always been there, or may be newly arrived, or may be something that has always lived in the well and only now taken form. She offers to interpret the visions — for a price. Those who pay speak of understanding things they'd rather not understand. Those who refuse leave the clearing and find they can never find it again.

---

## The Empty Fort

**Type:** Abandoned settlement, mystery
**Location:** Eastern Pinelands, on a hilltop overlooking the forest

### Description

A timber fort of clearly Imperial design, capable of housing several hundred soldiers. Completely abandoned. The Imperial records say it was garrisoned continuously until the Passing. The Passing records (such as they exist) say the garrison simply... vanished.

Not killed — there are no bodies. Not fled — their possessions remain, meals half-eaten, weapons on racks, beds slept-in. Not Reft — there are no signs of plague. The garrison was there, and then it wasn't.

### The Investigation

Several parties have explored the Empty Fort. All report the same things:
- The buildings are intact and eerily well-preserved
- Personal effects suggest sudden departure (or sudden non-existence)
- There are no written records of any kind — every document, journal, and ledger is blank
- Animals won't enter the palisade
- Staying overnight produces dreams of being erased

### The Hook

Someone has been maintaining the Empty Fort. The floors are swept, the wells are clean, candles are replenished. But no one is ever seen doing this work. The maintenance happens when observers look away, or between visits, or in moments that somehow don't quite exist.

What happened to the garrison? Who maintains the fort and why? Is this connected to the Abyss — to Katiari's realm of forgetting and absence? And why does anyone who sleeps there dream of the same thing: a woman standing at the edge of existence, waiting for someone to remember her?

# Part Four: Key Figures

## Jarl Sigrun Deeproot

**Full Name and Titles:** Sigrun Arnesdottir, Jarl of Holmgard, Keeper of the River, Voice of the Thing
**Age:** 67

### Character

Sigrun looks like exactly what she is: a former logger who became a leader through competence and survived through wisdom. Her hands are still calloused, her back is still straight, and her eyes miss nothing. She speaks directly, laughs freely, and governs without pretension.

She's been Jarl for thirty years because no one else wanted the job and she turned out to be good at it. Three husbands dead (two before her elevation, one after), six children raised, fifteen grandchildren scattered across the Pinelands. Her family network is her intelligence service; her reputation is her army.

### Goal

Keep Holmgard independent, fed, and growing. Use the chaos of the post-Passing world to establish the Pinelands as a self-sufficient region rather than an Imperial backwater. When the dust settles — if it ever does — Holmgard should be strong enough to negotiate as equals with whatever emerges.

### Complication

Sigrun is sixty-seven. She's healthy, but she won't live forever. None of her children have her combination of skills; her grandchildren are too young. She needs to establish institutions that can survive her death — but the Pinelands has never had institutions, just leaders. Teaching people to follow rules instead of rulers may be the hardest thing she's ever done.

---

## Völva Grímhild — The Seer of the Pines

**Full Name:** Grímhild (no family name given; may not have one)
**Role:** Wandering prophetess, keeper of old knowledge
**Age:** Unknown (appears elderly, but has appeared elderly for at least fifty years)

### Character

Grímhild walks the forest alone, appearing in villages when needed (or when she chooses), offering prophecy, advice, and occasionally assistance. She dresses in grey, speaks in riddles when she speaks at all, and knows things she shouldn't possibly know.

She is not officially associated with any tradition. The Axis Faith claims her as one of their mystics; local folk-religion considers her a spirit wearing human form; the Church (when it had presence here) called her a witch. She ignores all labels.

### Goal

Grímhild has never stated a goal. She seems to be *preparing* for something — gathering information, placing people in positions, nudging events in particular directions. Those who've dealt with her long-term sense a pattern they can't quite perceive, a story being told that hasn't reached its climax.

### Complication

Since the Passing, Grímhild has become more active and more direct. She's warned specific people about specific dangers. She's revealed secrets that were better kept hidden. And she's begun speaking of "the child who must remember" — a phrase that means nothing to anyone but clearly means everything to her.

Some believe Grímhild is connected to Katiari — to the forgotten sister, to the Abyss, to hope-in-hiding. If so, her increasing activity might mean the hero's journey is beginning. Or it might mean something else entirely.

---

## Trader Ingvar the Far-Traveled

**Full Name:** Ingvar Hrolfsson
**Role:** Merchant, information broker, possibly spy
**Age:** 42

### Character

Ingvar is one of the few people still traveling the long trade routes — not just within the Pinelands, but from the Pinelands to the Heartland, to the coast, even (he claims) to the Eastern Empire. He's survived raiders, Reft, broken roads, and failed bridges through a combination of skill, luck, and knowing exactly when to run.

He's charming, ruthless, and surprisingly well-informed. His trade goods are valuable, but his information is priceless. He sells both, to anyone who can pay.

### Goal

Profit, obviously. But Ingvar is also genuinely curious about the post-Passing world. He wants to know what's happening everywhere — not just for commercial advantage, but because the uncertainty bothers him. He's building a mental map of who survived, where power lies, and what might happen next.

### Complication

Someone is following Ingvar. Not bandits — he could handle bandits. Something else. Something that waits at the edges of his camps, that he glimpses in mirrors, that his horses shy from. He's traded with a lot of people since the Passing. He may have traded with something that wasn't human. And now it wants something he can't identify, let alone provide.

# Part Five: Local Conditions

## The Reft Situation

**Severity:** Low (compared to other regions)
**Concentration:** Abandoned settlements, old roads, clearings
**Predominant Types:** Root Reft (Land-field), Shadow Reft (Dark-field)

### Assessment

The Pinelands are paradoxically safe from Reft because the forest that makes human life difficult makes undead existence nearly impossible. The Reft wander. They follow roads. They cluster in open spaces. The trackless forest confuses them; trees block their movement; the lack of landmarks seems to affect their already-damaged cognition.

**Root Reft** are the exception — Reft attuned to the Land-field become territorial, refusing to leave their claimed spaces. They're dangerous if approached but can be avoided. Local communities have mapped Root Reft locations and route around them.

**Shadow Reft** are more worrying — they adapt to the forest's darkness, ambush from concealment, and hunt rather than wander. Fortunately, they're rare. Unfortunately, they're increasing.

### Current Defensive Measures

| Measure | Description | Effectiveness |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| **Forest trails** | Avoid roads; use hunter paths | High — Reft don't follow trails |
| **Noise discipline** | Minimize sound when traveling | Moderate — helps with wanderers |
| **Clearance patrols** | Regular sweeps of nearby areas | High — keeps concentration low |
| **Settlement bells** | Warning system for Reft approach | High — allows time to prepare |
| **Burning crews** | Specialists who destroy Reft bodies | Essential — prevents return |

## Travel

**Primary Routes:**
- **The Svartelv:** Main artery; navigable by small boats, log-rafts, or walking the shore
- **The Hunters' Trails:** Network of forest paths known to locals; invisible to outsiders
- **The Old Imperial Road:** Exists on maps; mostly overgrown; dangerous

**Travel Times (approximate):**

| Route | Distance | Time by Water | Time by Trail |
|-------|----------|---------------|---------------|
| Holmgard → Strömsby | ~120 miles | 3-4 days | 6-8 days |
| Holmgard → Djupdal | ~180 miles | N/A | 10-12 days |
| Holmgard → Tóftirnar | ~150 miles | Partial | 8-10 days |
| Holmgard → Vakttårn | ~200 miles | Partial | 12-15 days |

**Travel Risks:**

| Risk | Frequency | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------|
| Reft encounter | Low | Mostly avoidable with caution |
| Wildlife (wolves, bears) | Moderate | Worse in winter |
| Weather | Seasonal | Winter travel extremely dangerous |
| Getting lost | High for outsiders | Locals navigate by landmarks invisible to others |
| Bandits | Low | Insufficient targets to support banditry |

## Trade

**Exports:**
- **Timber:** The Pinelands' primary export; quality varies from construction-grade to ship-worthy
- **Furs:** Beaver, fox, wolf, bear; luxury goods for whoever can still afford luxury
- **Forest products:** Pine-resin, tar, turpentine, charcoal
- **Amber:** Occasionally found in old-growth areas
- **Knowledge:** Guides who know the forest are valuable

**Imports:**
- **Metal:** The Pinelands have no mining; all metal must be imported
- **Grain:** Forest agriculture can't sustain population; food imports essential
- **Cloth:** Local production limited to rough wool
- **Salt:** Critical for food preservation; must be imported
- **Manufactured goods:** Tools, weapons, household items

**Current State:**

The traditional trade routes to the Heartland have collapsed. Coastal trade with the Fjordlands continues but at reduced volume. Holmgard is increasingly focused on regional self-sufficiency rather than export economy.

**Barter has returned.** Currency means little when there's no central authority to guarantee it. Goods trade directly: timber for metal, furs for grain, services for supplies.

## Religion

**Official:** Solarian Church (nominal)
**Actual:** Mixed, syncretic, pragmatic

### The Practiced Faiths

**Axis Faith Influence:**
Many Pinelands settlers came from the mountains or have dwarven trading relationships. The Axis Faith's emphasis on transformation, exchange, and the sacred nature of work resonates with forest communities. Forges and sawmills are blessed according to Axis rites.

**Alysian/Land Tradition:**
The forest is alive and must be respected. Offerings before felling trees. Asking permission before hunting. Hospitality to strangers (who might be Fae). The Wheel of the Year governs planting, harvesting, and festivals.

**Ostaran/Ancestor Veneration:**
The dead remain present. Shrines in homes honor ancestors. The Ship-Graves at Strömsby reflect genuine belief that the dead watch over the living. Death is not feared but negotiated with.

**Revnan/Dark Tradition:**
The forest's darkness is not evil but deep. Some wise-folk practice the old shadow-ways — reading meaning in darkness, finding truth in what's hidden. Not widely discussed, not quite secret.

**The Solarian Remnant:**
Brother Aldmar maintains Solarian rites for those who want them. A few genuine believers remain, mostly older folk who converted sincerely during the Empire's height. They're treated with the same tolerance as any other faith.

### The Post-Passing Reality

The Passing proved that *no* faith offered protection. Every tradition failed equally. This has produced not atheism but pluralism — the gods are real, but clearly limited, and hedging bets by respecting all of them seems wise.

## The Scars

**Passing-Wounds in the Pinelands:**

| Type | Location | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| **The Silent Vale** | Western forest | A valley where no sound exists — shouting produces no noise, footsteps are silent, even heartbeats seem to fade |
| **The Wrong Grove** | Near Djupdal | A section of forest where the trees grow at impossible angles, defying gravity; animals avoid it; compasses spin |
| **The Ash-Walk** | Southern road | A stretch of road where everything died — trees, soil, insects — leaving a grey path of sterile ash |
| **The Weeping Stones** | Near Tóftirnar | Boulders that produce water continuously, regardless of weather; the water tastes of tears |

### The Scars' Significance

These wounds haven't healed in seven years. Some scholars theorize they represent places where the Passing creatures' passage was closest, where the rules of reality bent beyond recovery. Others suggest they're doorways — places where the Hawthorne was punctured and not quite sealed.

The locals avoid them. The locals also haven't tried to study them. Perhaps someone should.

# Part Six: Adventure Hooks

## 1. The Returning Dead

**Setup:** The Svartmyr is disgorging its preserved dead at an increasing rate. Most collapse and stay down, but the latest emergence — a woman in clothing three centuries out of date — didn't collapse. She walked to Holmgard. She's trying to communicate. And she seems to be warning about something.

**The Complication:** The bog-woman speaks a language that died before Imperial contact. The artifacts she carries include what might be a map to something buried in the Svartmyr. And the mire seems to be *angry* that she left — the waters are rising, threatening downstream settlements.

**Stakes:** If the warning is real, something is coming. If the map leads somewhere, it might reveal pre-human secrets. If the mire isn't calmed, people will die.

---

## 2. The Children of the Trees

**Setup:** Grandfather Tree seeds have germinated. The saplings are growing at impossible speed — a foot per day, then two, then more. They're also *moving*, roots pulling through soil, heading in a specific direction. And where they pass, the forest changes — animals flee, other plants die, the land becomes something not quite like land anymore.

**The Complication:** The saplings are heading toward Holmgard. They'll arrive in weeks at current speed. Nobody knows what happens when they reach the city. The Ancient Oak in Holmgard's center has begun *responding* — producing its own seeds, dropping them, as if preparing for something.

**Stakes:** The Grandfather Trees might be awakening to protect the forest. Or to claim it. Or to transform it into something unsuitable for human habitation. Understanding their intention — and potentially redirecting it — is critical.

---

## 3. The Empty Fort's Keeper

**Setup:** Someone has been seen at the Empty Fort. A figure in grey, moving among the buildings, maintaining the structures. When approached, they vanish. But they've left something behind: a journal, written in a hand that belongs to the fort's former commander. A journal that describes the day the garrison was erased — from the perspective of someone watching it happen.

**The Complication:** The journal speaks of "the woman at the threshold," of bargains offered and refused, of a choice that wasn't quite a choice. It suggests the garrison wasn't killed — they were *unmade*, removed from existence so thoroughly that reality closed over where they'd been. And it suggests this can happen again.

**Stakes:** The Empty Fort might be a weapon, or a warning, or a door. Understanding what happened there could reveal something crucial about the Abyss, about Katiari, about the nature of forgetting itself.

---

## 4. The Völva's Request

**Setup:** Grímhild has appeared at Holmgard — not wandering through, but specifically arriving, specifically seeking. She has a task for someone capable: travel to the Urdarbrun, drink from the well, and bring back what you see. Not for her — she's already seen too much. For someone else. For the one who needs to know what's coming.

**The Complication:** The journey to Urdarbrun is dangerous — the well moves, the path shifts, and what guards it now is not what guarded it before the Passing. The visions themselves are damaging — seeing fate has costs. And Grímhild isn't saying who the vision is for, or why they need it.

**Stakes:** Grímhild has never asked for help before. Whatever she's seen, it's important enough to change her pattern of centuries. The vision might reveal the hero's path, or the world's ending, or the truth about Katiari — or all three at once.

---

## 5. The Trade Route

**Setup:** Trader Ingvar has returned from the Heartland with news: a route exists. Dangerous, yes. Long, certainly. But passable. Holmgard could reconnect with southern markets. The Pinelands could trade their timber for metal, their furs for grain. The isolation could end.

**The Complication:** The route passes through territories controlled by unknown powers — warlords, religious factions, possibly something worse. Ingvar won't travel it again alone. He needs guards, negotiators, people who can fight and talk and adapt. And he needs them to understand that whatever's following him might follow them too.

**Stakes:** The Pinelands' long-term survival may depend on reconnecting with the wider world. But the wider world has changed in seven years. What awaits on the southern road might be opportunity, danger, or something that shouldn't be let in.
