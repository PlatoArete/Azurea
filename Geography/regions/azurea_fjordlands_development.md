# Azurea: Fjordlands Sub-Region Development
## Round 3.2 — Provincia Borealis / Norðmark

---

# Overview

**Region:** The North (Provincia Borealis / Norðmark)
**Sub-Region:** Fjordlands (Firðaland)
**Capital:** Fjordhavn
**Development Status:** Expanded from Partial

The Fjordlands occupy the northernmost reaches of the Empire—a jagged coastline of deep inlets carved by ancient ice, where the sea meets the endless cold. This is a land of whale-hunters and shipwrights, of sea-priests who read omens in the aurora, and of people who have always known that the Empire's laws grow thin where the Ice Ocean begins.

The Church never held firm here. The folk kept their old ways—not the Axis Faith of the mountain dwarves, but something older still: the veneration of sea-spirits, ancestor-guardians, and the great whales that are both prey and sacred beings. When the Passing came, the Fjordlanders lost much, but they also discovered that the old ways offered protections the Church could not provide.

Now Admiral Tova Storm-Singer rules from Fjordhavn, having made an unprecedented peace with Wylltic raiders who once plagued these waters. Strange things move in the northern depths. The aurora speaks in colors no one remembers seeing before. And somewhere beyond the ice, in waters no ship has charted, something is stirring.

# Part One: The Capital City

## Fjordhavn — The Fjord-Haven

**Imperial Name:** Portus Sinuum (Port of the Inlets)
**Local Name:** Fjordhavn (FYORD-hahvn) — "Fjord-Harbor"
**Common Names:** The Haven, The North-Gate, The Whale-Road's End

### Location and Geography

Fjordhavn sits at the mouth of **Stórfjörð** (the Great Fjord), the largest of the northern inlets where the Ice Ocean meets habitable land. The fjord runs forty miles inland, its walls rising sheer for hundreds of feet, before branching into smaller waterways that penetrate deep into the mountains.

The city occupies a natural amphitheater where the fjord widens briefly before opening to the sea. The harbor is sheltered from ocean storms by two headlands—**Varðanes** (Watch-Point) to the north and **Hvíldarnes** (Rest-Point) to the south—creating a protected anchorage that rarely freezes despite the latitude.

**The Setting:**
- Built on three levels rising from the waterfront
- Wooden construction (stone doesn't survive the frost-heaves)
- Tarred timber and sod roofs for insulation
- Boardwalks connecting buildings above mud and snow
- The great **Whale-Bone Arch** marking the harbor entrance

### Scale

| Period | Population | Notes |
|--------|------------|-------|
| Pre-Passing | ~20,000 | Fishing, whaling, shipbuilding, northern trade |
| Post-Passing | ~12,000 | Refugees departed; survivors consolidated |
| Current Composition | Mixed | 60% native Fjordlanders, 25% refugees from smaller settlements, 15% outsiders (traders, Wylltic guests, others) |

### The Five Quarters

#### 1. The Harbor Quarter (Höfnarhverfi)

The lowest level, built on pilings driven into the seafloor and filled with gravel and whale-bone. This is where Fjordhavn meets the world.

**Character:** Salt-crusted, fish-reeking, alive with commerce and the creak of rope. The wharves extend like fingers into the fjord, each controlled by different merchant families or guilds.

**Notable Features:**
- **The Long Wharves:** Seven major piers, each named for the family that built it (Ormsson's Wharf, Ketilsdóttir's Landing, etc.)
- **The Fish-Market (Fiskmarkaðr):** Daily auction of the catch; the closest thing to democracy in Fjordhavn
- **The Rope-Walk:** Quarter-mile covered shed where rope is twisted; doubles as neutral meeting ground
- **The Tarring-Sheds:** Where boats are waterproofed; the smell never leaves

**Post-Passing:** The wharves are half-empty. Ships that never returned left gaps like missing teeth. But those that remain are busy—trade with the Wylltic guests has proven surprisingly profitable.

#### 2. The Shipwright's District (Skipasmíðahverfi)

Northeast of the harbor, where the fjord wall provides shelter from the worst winds. Here the great ships are born.

**Character:** The constant sound of adzes and hammers, the smell of fresh-cut pine and tar, the sight of dragon-prowed hulls taking shape on the slipways. This is Fjordhavn's pride and its future.

**Notable Features:**
- **The Great Slipway:** Where ships up to sixty feet can be built; currently constructing a vessel unlike any seen before
- **The Timber-Yards:** Sorted wood from the Pinelands—oak for keels, pine for planking, spruce for masts
- **The Carvers' Hall:** Where figureheads are shaped; sacred work done in ritual silence
- **The Old Ways Shrine:** A small temple where shipwrights make offerings before laying a keel

**Post-Passing:** The shipwrights have adapted. They build smaller, faster, more maneuverable vessels—designed for waters where strange things swim. The new designs incorporate Wylltic innovations, much to traditionalist displeasure.

#### 3. The Thane's Rise (Þegnsbrekkа)

The middle level, climbing the slope above the harbor. Administrative, religious, and residential for the better-off families.

**Character:** More permanent structures—some with stone foundations, though the upper stories remain wood. Broader streets, less fish-smell, more respectability.

**Notable Features:**
- **The Thane's Hall (Þegnshöll):** Traditional seat of governance, now Admiral Tova's headquarters; a great timber hall with a roof of overlapping shields
- **The Admiral's Tower:** New construction, stone and wood, commanding views of the harbor and fjord-mouth
- **The Solarian Chapel of St. Aldric:** Small, poorly attended, maintained by a single aging priest
- **The Gathering-Stone (Þingsteinn):** Ancient flat rock where assemblies are held; predates the Empire

**Post-Passing:** The Thane's Hall has become the true center of power. The Church chapel stands empty most days, its priest performing services for fewer than a dozen faithful. Admiral Tova rules from here with a council of captains and elders.

#### 4. The High Town (Efribær)

The uppermost level, where the old families and the wealthy merchants keep their homes. Also where the dead are honored.

**Character:** Quieter, wind-swept, with views across the fjord to the opposite wall. Houses here have small gardens where hardy vegetables struggle against the cold. The wealthy live simply by southern standards but comfortably by northern ones.

**Notable Features:**
- **The Ancestor-Houses (Forfaðrahús):** Family shrines where the names and deeds of the dead are kept; some date back centuries
- **The Seer's House:** Home of the völva Yrsa Moonwhisper; sought by all for guidance
- **The Merchant-Lord's Compound:** Largest private residence, belonging to the Ormsson family
- **The Signal-Tower:** Where fires are lit to warn of danger or welcome returning ships

**Post-Passing:** Many houses stand empty—families ended or fled south. The Ancestor-Houses are fuller than the living quarters. Some refugees have been settled in abandoned homes, creating tensions with the old families.

#### 5. The Outer Warrens (Útiborgir)

Beyond the main settlement, sprawling along the fjord's edge and climbing the lower slopes. Where the working poor, the newcomers, and the less respectable live.

**Character:** Improvised, constantly rebuilt, a maze of huts and shacks connected by muddy paths. Fire is a constant danger. Community is the only real security.

**Notable Features:**
- **The Smokehouses:** Where fish and whale-meat are preserved; employs dozens
- **The Renderers' Yard:** Where whale blubber becomes oil; the smell keeps property values low
- **The Wylltic Quarter (Villthverfi):** New area where the guest-raiders have established themselves
- **The Drift-Wood Market:** Where scavengers sell what the sea provides

**Post-Passing:** Swollen with refugees from smaller settlements. The Reft are a constant danger at the edges. The Wylltic Quarter is better organized than the rest—the raiders brought their own customs of order.

### Landmarks

#### The Whale-Bone Arch (Hvalbeinsbogi)

**Description:** An arch formed from the jawbones of a great whale, large enough for ships to pass beneath. It marks the harbor entrance and serves as a sacred threshold.

**History:** The whale that provided these bones was killed three centuries ago by a legendary captain. Some say it was the last of its kind. Others say its spirit guards the harbor still.

**Current State:** Carved with protective runes by generations of sea-priests. During the Passing, witnesses swear the arch *glowed*—and the creatures that passed overhead seemed to avoid the harbor.

#### The Admiral's Tower (Aðmíralsturni)

**Description:** A stone-and-timber watchtower rising sixty feet above the Thane's Rise, with a constantly-manned observation platform at its peak.

**Function:** Command post for harbor defense, signal station, and Admiral Tova's private quarters at the top. The only building in Fjordhavn visible from far out at sea.

**Current State:** Newly reinforced since the Passing. A permanent garrison of twenty marines. The great signal-fire at the top has been replaced with something the Admiral brought back from a voyage—a crystalline device that produces light without flame.

#### The Gathering-Stone (Þingsteinn)

**Description:** A flat natural rock, roughly forty feet across, worn smooth by centuries of assemblies. Surrounded by a ring of standing stones, each representing one of the old sea-clans.

**Function:** Traditional site of the **þing** (assembly) where disputes are settled, laws are made, and the community makes major decisions. Admiral Tova has revived its use.

**Current State:** After years of Imperial rule that ignored local customs, the þing meets again. Monthly assemblies draw representatives from every quarter and from outlying settlements. Not everyone is pleased—the old families resent newcomers having equal voice.

#### The Long Hearth (Langeldur)

**Description:** A communal hall maintained by the city, where anyone can find warmth, a place to sleep, and thin soup. The hearth runs the length of the building—nearly a hundred feet.

**Function:** Emergency shelter, gathering place for the poor, and—increasingly—the closest thing to a temple the old ways have. Sea-priests lead informal ceremonies here.

**Current State:** Crowded since the Passing. The refugees who cannot find other lodging sleep in shifts. The hearth-fire has burned continuously for longer than anyone can remember—keeping it lit is considered sacred duty.

#### The Drowned House (Druknað Hús)

**Description:** A partially submerged structure at the water's edge, its lower floors flooded at high tide, accessible only at low water.

**Function:** Once a wealthy merchant's home built too low. Now a shrine to **Draugar**—the drowned dead who did not return. Offerings are placed in the flooded chambers.

**Current State:** Since the Passing, the Drowned House has become more important. Too many died at sea. The flooded chambers are full of offerings—personal items, carved names, small boats set adrift inside. Sea-priests perform ceremonies there on the lowest tides.

### Atmosphere

**Sights:** Grey-green water lapping at tarred pilings. Ships with painted prows nodding at anchor. Smoke rising from a hundred chimneys into fog that never quite lifts. The dark walls of the fjord framing everything. Ravens everywhere.

**Sounds:** The creak of rigging. Hammers from the shipyards. Gulls screaming. The deep horn that announces ships entering the fjord. Singing from the Long Hearth at night—old songs in the old tongue.

**Smells:** Salt and fish, always. Tar and pine from the shipyards. Smoke from the smokehouses. The rank sweetness of the renderers' yards when the wind is wrong.

**The Feel:** A place that knows the sea is not a friend, but neither is it entirely enemy. A place that has learned to be small and clever rather than large and proud. A place that has always survived by understanding that the world is bigger than human concerns, and hope comes from accepting that rather than denying it.

### Who Rules

**Admiral Tova Storm-Singer** holds effective power, though she's careful to govern through traditional forms—the þing for major decisions, the council of captains for military matters, the merchant families for trade.

**The Old Forms:**
- **The Þing:** Monthly assemblies at the Gathering-Stone; genuine deliberation, though Tova's voice carries weight
- **The Council of Captains:** Military and maritime matters; meets in the Thane's Hall
- **The Merchant Consortium:** Trade and commerce; the Ormsson family leads but doesn't dominate

**The Church:** Officially, a Solarian priest serves the spiritual needs of the faithful. In practice, Father Aldhelm conducts services for a shrinking congregation while most of the city follows older ways openly for the first time in generations.

### The Tension

**The Central Conflict:** The old ways are resurgent, but what are the old ways exactly?

**Faction 1 — The Traditionalists:**
- Led by the Ormsson family and the oldest sea-clans
- Want to restore exactly what existed before the Empire
- Suspicious of the Wylltic guests
- Resistant to refugees having political voice

**Faction 2 — The Pragmatists:**
- Led by Admiral Tova and the younger captains
- Want to preserve useful traditions while adapting to new realities
- See the Wylltic alliance as essential
- Support refugee integration

**Faction 3 — The Faithful Remnant:**
- Father Aldhelm and the few remaining Solarian believers
- Believe the Passing was punishment for abandoning the true faith
- Increasingly marginalized
- Some among them are sincere; others report to powers in the south

**The Underlying Question:** Is Fjordhavn still part of the Empire, or something new? Admiral Tova has paid no tribute since the Passing. No Imperial orders have arrived. But neither has she declared independence. The ambiguity serves for now.

# Part Two: Secondary Settlements

## Hvalsund — The Whale-Sound

**Imperial Name:** Portus Cetarium (Whale Port)
**Local Name:** Hvalsund (HVAHL-soond) — "Whale-Sound"
**Type:** Major whaling station and processing center
**Population:** Pre-Passing ~4,000 / Post-Passing ~2,500

### Location

Forty miles up the Great Fjord from Fjordhavn, where a side-channel opens into a natural bay. The whales pass through on their migration, funneled by the fjord's walls into the killing-grounds.

### Character

Hvalsund exists for one purpose: the slaughter and rendering of whales. The town spreads along the shore of the bay, dominated by the great **flensing-platforms** where whale carcasses are butchered, the **rendering-houses** where blubber becomes oil, and the **bone-yards** where skeletons are processed for a dozen uses.

The smell is indescribable. Residents claim not to notice anymore.

**The Society:** Intensely hierarchical based on whaling skill. The **Harpooners** form an elite, almost priestly caste. Below them, the **Flensers** who butcher the carcasses. Below them, the **Renderers** who work the try-pots. At the bottom, everyone else.

**The Whale-Faith:** Hvalsund practices the old ways more purely than anywhere else. The whales are sacred prey—divine gifts that must be taken with proper ritual. The Harpooners undergo years of training that is as much spiritual as practical. A whale killed without proper rites brings curse.

**Post-Passing:** The whaling continues, but the herds are diminished. Some say the Passing drove the whales away. Others say something else is hunting them now—something seen only in glimpses in the deep water. The Harpooners have begun refusing to go out in certain conditions, citing omens they won't explain.

### Notable Feature

**The Whale-Skull Temple (Hvalkúputempl)**

A structure built inside the skull of the largest whale ever taken in these waters—a beast from legend, killed five generations ago. The skull alone is large enough to hold fifty worshippers. Here the Harpooners receive their blessings, here the whale-spirits are propitiated, and here—since the Passing—the sea-priests have conducted ceremonies seeking to understand what has changed in the deep waters.

---

## Isheim — The Ice-Home

**Imperial Name:** Ultima Thule (The Farthest North)
**Local Name:** Isheim (EES-haym) — "Ice-Home"
**Type:** Frontier trading post and settlement
**Population:** Pre-Passing ~800 / Post-Passing ~500 (variable)

### Location

At the very edge of habitable land, where the Great Fjord system ends and the permanent ice begins. A day's hard sailing beyond Hvalsund, or three days overland on paths that exist only in high summer.

### Character

Isheim is less a town than a challenge to nature. Buildings are half-buried in the permafrost for insulation. The population shrinks and swells with the seasons—at midwinter, only the hardiest remain; in summer, traders from the south join hunters heading onto the ice.

**The Trade:** Isheim exists because of what lies beyond it. On the ice live peoples the Empire never conquered, never mapped, barely acknowledges—the **Ísafolk** (Ice-People). They bring furs, ivory, rare oils, and stranger things in exchange for metal tools, grain, and salt. This trade is officially illegal (no Imperial permits were ever granted), but no one enforces laws this far north.

**The Mystery:** The Ísafolk are human but... different. Adapted to cold in ways that seem impossible. Speaking a language that shares no roots with Imperial or Norse tongues. Possessing knowledge of navigation, of ice-craft, of survival that defies explanation. Some say they were here before the migrations, before the Empire, before the God-Giant War. They say nothing.

**Post-Passing:** The Ísafolk have stopped coming to trade. They arrived once, last winter, spoke briefly of "wrong colors in the sky" and "the sleeper turning in its bed," and left. No one has seen them since. Isheim's traders are worried—and curious.

### Notable Feature

**The Ice-Gate (Ísahlið)**

At the edge of the permanent ice stands a natural formation—two pillars of frozen seawater, blue-white and ancient, framing a gap that leads out onto the ice-field. The Ísafolk always enter through this gate. They refuse to approach from any other direction. No one knows why, but everyone respects it.

Since the Passing, the gate has changed. Patterns appear in the ice, swirling, shifting, almost like writing. The patterns are never the same twice. No one can read them. Someone has begun copying them down.

---

## Klippvik — The Cliff-Bay

**Imperial Name:** Rupes Maritima (Sea-Cliffs)
**Local Name:** Klippvik (KLIP-veek) — "Cliff-Bay"
**Type:** Fishing village and sea-bird harvesting
**Population:** Pre-Passing ~1,200 / Post-Passing ~800

### Location

Twenty miles south of Fjordhavn along the coast, where the cliffs rise sheer for five hundred feet and sea-birds nest by the tens of thousands. A small bay at the cliff's base provides the only shelter.

### Character

Klippvik is built both at the cliff's base and—remarkably—into the cliff face itself. Rope-ladders and timber platforms connect dwellings carved into the rock at various heights. The villagers are as comfortable on vertical surfaces as horizontal ones.

**The Harvest:** Eggs, fledglings, and adult birds are gathered from the nesting cliffs. This requires climbing skills that seem superhuman to outsiders—children learn as soon as they can walk. The harvest follows strict rules about what can be taken and when, ensuring the colonies survive.

**The Religion:** The cliff-dwellers worship the birds as aspects of Alys (Land) rather than Atargatis (Sea)—unusual for coastal people. They believe the birds are messengers between worlds, that their cries carry prayers upward.

**Post-Passing:** The birds returned after a year's absence. The villagers took this as a sign—their faith was vindicated, their home blessed. But the birds' behavior has changed. They nest in different patterns. They fly at strange hours. They make sounds no one remembers hearing before.

### Notable Feature

**The Guano-Church (Mykjukirkja)**

A natural cave in the cliff face, accessible only by rope-descent, where accumulated guano has been carved into something resembling a cathedral. The ammonia smell is eye-watering, but the villagers consider it holy. Sea-priests come here to seek visions—the fumes are said to open the inner eye. (Healers say the fumes are simply toxic and the "visions" are brain-damage.)

---

## Steinborg — The Stone-Fortress

**Imperial Name:** Castellum Saxeum (Stone Castle)
**Local Name:** Steinborg (STAYN-borg) — "Stone-Fortress"
**Type:** Military outpost and lighthouse
**Population:** Pre-Passing ~600 / Post-Passing ~400

### Location

On Varðanes (Watch-Point), the northern headland that protects Fjordhavn's harbor. A spit of rock extending into the sea, connected to the mainland by a narrow causeway that floods at high tide.

### Character

Steinborg is one of the few stone structures in the Fjordlands—built by Imperial engineers centuries ago to project power into the north. The fortress commands the approaches to Fjordhavn, and its lighthouse guides ships through the treacherous waters.

**The Garrison:** Traditionally manned by Imperial troops, Steinborg has changed hands. Admiral Tova took it early in the post-Passing chaos, and now it's held by her most trusted marines. The old Imperial standards still fly, but no one expects Imperial reinforcement.

**The Lighthouse:** A tower within the fortress, topped by a great brass mirror and eternal flame. The flame is fed by whale-oil and has burned continuously for two centuries. Maintaining it is the garrison's primary duty.

**Post-Passing:** The fortress holds, but uneasily. The garrison reports strange signals from the sea at night—lights that aren't ships, sounds that aren't storms. The lighthouse has begun attracting... things. Moths of impossible size. Birds that fly in spirals around the flame for hours. And once, something that left marks on the tower wall that no one can explain.

### Notable Feature

**The Drowned Garrison (Drukknað Varðlið)**

Below the current fortress, accessible at the lowest tides, lie the remains of an earlier fortification. It sank centuries ago—either the rock shifted or the builders misjudged the water level. The drowned chambers are said to be haunted by the soldiers who died there. Some say their ghosts still man the walls, eternally defending against an enemy that never came.

Since the Passing, divers report that something has moved in. The ghosts—if there were ghosts—are gone. Something else occupies the drowned garrison now. The divers won't describe it. They won't dive there anymore.

---

## Varghöfn — The Wolf-Harbor

**Imperial Name:** Portus Luporum (Wolf Port)
**Local Name:** Varghöfn (VARG-höfn) — "Wolf-Harbor"
**Type:** Hunting village and fur trade
**Population:** Pre-Passing ~900 / Post-Passing ~600

### Location

Inland from the coast, where one of the smaller fjords terminates in a river valley. The only major settlement in the Fjordlands not directly on the sea.

### Character

Varghöfn serves the interior—the forested slopes and tundra beyond the fjord system. Hunters bring furs, antlers, amber, and rare herbs. Trappers maintain lines stretching miles into the wilderness. The village is the interface between sea-Fjordlanders and the few who make their living in the harsh interior.

**The Wolf-Bond:** The village takes its name from an ancient compact with the wolves of the region. The wolves do not hunt the villagers' dogs; the villagers do not hunt the wolves. How this compact was made, no one remembers. But it holds.

**The Interior Trade:** From Varghöfn, paths lead eventually to the Pinelands and then south toward the Heartland. In better times, furs and amber flowed south while manufactured goods came north. Now the trade is a trickle—but it continues.

**Post-Passing:** The wolves have begun acting strangely. They come closer to the village than ever before, watching but not threatening. They howl in patterns that seem almost meaningful. The hunters say the wolves are trying to warn them of something. The wolves say nothing humans can understand.

### Notable Feature

**The Wolf-Stone (Vargsteinn)**

A standing stone outside the village, carved with images of wolves and humans in apparent cooperation. Offerings are left here—meat in lean times, carved figurines at other times. The stone is said to mark the place where the original compact was made.

Since the Passing, the wolves have been seen gathering at the Wolf-Stone on certain nights—sitting in a circle around it, silent, watching the sky. When humans approach during these gatherings, the wolves leave without aggression but clearly do not want company. What they're doing, no one knows.

---

# Part Three: Notable Sites

## The Drowned Temple (Druknað Hof)

**Location:** Beneath the waters of the Great Fjord, approximately twenty miles from its mouth, visible only at the lowest tides.

**Type:** Ruined religious site (Axis Faith)

### Description

In ages past, when sea levels were lower, an Axis Faith temple stood on what is now the fjord bottom. The temple marked a point where the underworld came close to the surface—a sacred convergence of Gwenaelle's stone and Atargatis's water.

The temple is mostly intact—massive stone blocks don't dissolve easily—but drowned. At the lowest tides, the uppermost structures break the surface: a few feet of carved granite, barnacle-crusted but clearly shaped by intelligent hands.

### History

Built before the Empire, during the era when Axis Faith missionaries traveled freely through the north. Abandoned when the waters rose—whether through natural climate change or something more purposeful. The Axis Faith records mention the temple, but claim it was "given to the waters" rather than lost.

### Current State

The local people have always known about the Drowned Temple, but they've also always avoided it. The currents around it are treacherous. The rock formations beneath are said to trap boats. Divers who've explored it report feeling *watched*.

Since the Passing, the temple has become more visible. The tides that reveal it are more extreme. Some say the waters are receding—that the temple is rising. Others say that's nonsense, a trick of observation.

But something is definitely happening. The barnacles have begun dying. The stonework is cleaner than it's been in centuries. And at the lowest tides, faint lights can be seen within the submerged chambers.

### The Hook

The temple contains the **Forge-Seal**—a consecrated object that, according to Axis Faith tradition, anchors the spiritual connection between Gwenaelle's realm and this specific place. If the Seal were recovered, it might be able to re-establish that connection. In a world where the realm-fields are increasingly unstable, that might matter.

But the temple is guarded. Not by the Axis Faith, who abandoned it long ago. By something that moved in when they left. Something patient.

---

## The Aurora-Pool (Norðurljóslaug)

**Location:** High in the mountains above the fjord system, accessible only by difficult climb.

**Type:** Natural phenomenon with supernatural properties

### Description

A perfectly circular pool, perhaps thirty feet across, fed by a hot spring. The water is warm regardless of season. The pool sits in a natural bowl surrounded by peaks.

The remarkable property: the pool *reflects the aurora borealis even when the aurora isn't visible*. On clear nights, colors dance across the water's surface even when the sky above is dark. The reflections don't match the sky—they show auroras that aren't there, or aren't there *yet*, or were there *once*.

### History

The sea-priests have used the Aurora-Pool for divination since before Imperial records began. The colors are read for meaning: green for good sailing, red for storms, blue for matters of the spirit, purple for messages from the dead. Journeys to consult the Pool are arduous but considered essential before major decisions.

### Current State

Since the Passing, the Aurora-Pool shows colors no one has ever recorded. Colors that hurt to look at. Colors that seem to move *through* dimensions rather than across them. The sea-priests are troubled.

The most skilled among them, who have spent decades learning to read the Pool, say they no longer understand what they're seeing. Some have stopped consulting it entirely. Others have become obsessed, climbing to the Pool repeatedly, returning with disturbing pronouncements they won't explain.

### The Hook

The Pool is showing something specific. Something is approaching—not from across the sea, but from *outside*. The Eldritch creatures of the Passing came and went, but they disturbed something. The Aurora-Pool is a window onto that disturbance. Someone needs to understand what it's showing before whatever it predicts arrives.

---

## The Whale-Grave (Hvalgröf)

**Location:** A remote beach at the end of a minor fjord, rarely visited.

**Type:** Sacred site / mass grave

### Description

Centuries ago, a pod of whales beached themselves here—hundreds of them, the largest mass stranding ever recorded. The people of that era butchered what they could but were overwhelmed by the scale. The rest rotted, and eventually only bones remained.

The beach is now a forest of whale skeletons, partially buried in sand but still recognizable. Ribs arch like cathedral vaults. Skulls the size of houses stare with empty sockets. The scale is difficult to process.

### History

The mass stranding was interpreted as a message from the whale-spirits, though no one agreed on what the message was. Some said it was a gift—the whales sacrificing themselves to feed a starving people. Others said it was a curse—the whales dying in protest of over-hunting. Others said neither, that the whales were fleeing something worse and happened to beach here.

Over time, the Whale-Grave became sacred regardless of interpretation. Offerings are left here. Vows are sworn here. The dying are sometimes brought here to spend their final hours among the bones.

### Current State

The Whale-Grave has changed since the Passing. The bones glow faintly at night—a soft blue-green phosphorescence. The sand around them has become darker, almost black. And the bones themselves seem to be... arranging themselves. Not dramatically. Not visibly. But visitors swear the skulls face different directions each time, that the ribs have shifted into new patterns.

Most disturbing: new bones have appeared. Fresh ones. Bones of whales that died recently and somehow *arrived here on their own*, washing up on this specific beach despite the currents running the wrong way.

### The Hook

Something is gathering the whale-dead. Something is building with them. The sea-priests of Hvalsund believe the whale-spirits are preparing for something—but they don't know what. They've asked for someone to investigate, to spend nights at the Whale-Grave and watch what happens. Previous watchers have returned... changed.

---

## The Storm-Throne (Stormsæti)

**Location:** Atop the highest sea-cliff in the Fjordlands, where the full force of ocean storms strikes.

**Type:** Natural formation / ancient coronation site

### Description

A natural rock formation shaped like a massive chair, carved by wind and water into something too perfect to be coincidence. The "seat" is sized for a large human. The "armrests" provide grips. The "back" shields the sitter from the worst weather coming from behind while leaving them exposed to everything from the front.

To sit in the Storm-Throne during a storm is to experience something beyond description. The wind becomes a wall. The rain becomes needles. Lightning strikes the sea below. And the sitter—if they survive—emerges *changed*.

### History

Before the Empire, before perhaps even the migrations, chiefs were crowned here. Not appointed, not elected—*confirmed*. Only those who could survive the Storm-Throne in full tempest were worthy to rule. Many died. Those who lived became legends.

The practice ended with Imperial rule. The Governors appointed from the south weren't interested in drowning themselves for local legitimacy. The Storm-Throne became a curiosity, a tourist attraction for the brave, a place locals told stories about.

### Current State

Admiral Tova Storm-Singer sat the Storm-Throne during the worst storm of the Passing—the night the Eldritch creatures passed overhead and the sea went mad. She shouldn't have survived. No one survives storms like that.

She emerged three days later, having lost most of her crew, having gained something she won't fully describe. Her surname changed after that night. She was Tova Ketilsdóttir before. Now she's Storm-Singer, and when she sings during storms, the storms seem to *listen*.

The Storm-Throne has been more active since. Storms seem to find it. Lightning strikes the cliff far more often than statistics would suggest. And sometimes, in calm weather, those who approach the Throne swear they hear voices in the wind—speaking in a language of pure sound, offering something impossible to understand.

### The Hook

The Storm-Throne is a conduit to something. The storms that strike it aren't random—they're *testing*. Something in the realm of storms (Gwenaelle's domain? Something older?) is looking for worthy vessels. Admiral Tova passed its test. Others might too. The question is what the testers want and whether passing their tests is actually wise.

---

## Katthöfn — The Cat-Harbor (Lost Settlement)

**Location:** Unknown. Formerly a fishing village somewhere along the outer coast.

**Type:** Lost settlement / mystery

### Description

Katthöfn was a small fishing village of perhaps two hundred people. Its location was never precisely mapped—the Empire didn't bother with such minor settlements—but locals knew it as a day's sail south of Klippvik.

Two years after the Passing, fishermen sailing that route noticed Katthöfn was gone. Not destroyed—*absent*. The inlet where it stood was empty. No buildings, no docks, no debris. Even the paths that led to it from inland had vanished, grown over as if they'd never existed.

### History

Katthöfn was unremarkable. A fishing village like a dozen others. It had no particular significance in any tradition, no ancient history, no notable residents. Its cats were many and well-fed on fish-scraps, hence the name.

### Current State

Extensive searching has found no trace. Survivors from the village have not appeared in other settlements. The people of Katthöfn—two hundred souls—have simply vanished.

But the cats are still there. Sailors report seeing them sometimes, on shores that shouldn't exist. Dozens of cats, sitting and watching ships pass, then disappearing when the ship draws too close. The shores where the cats appear don't match any coastline on the charts.

### The Hook

What happened to Katthöfn? The leading theories:

1. **Mass death:** The village was killed, probably by Reft, and the buildings collapsed or burned, leaving nothing. The missing paths and perfect absence argue against this.

2. **Flight:** The villagers fled elsewhere and the village was somehow *erased* by natural forces. But fled where? Why leave no trace?

3. **Slippage:** The village slipped *somewhere else*—into another realm, another time, another version of reality. The cats that sometimes appear are glimpses through the crack.

4. **Something took them:** Something wanted Katthöfn and its people for reasons unknown. The cats were left behind as witnesses, or as a message, or as a trap.

Someone needs to find where Katthöfn went. The cats appear to be waiting for something.

# Part Four: Key Figures

## Admiral Tova Storm-Singer

**Full Name:** Tova Ketilsdóttir Storm-Singer
**Role:** De facto ruler of Fjordhavn and the Fjordlands
**Age:** 47

### Background

Born to a minor maritime family, Tova rose through talent rather than birth. She commanded her first ship at 22, survived three Wylltic raids, explored waters no one had charted, and was appointed Admiral of the Northern Fleet by an Imperial Governor who recognized competence when he saw it.

When the Passing came, the Governor fled south. Tova stayed. She organized the defense, led the rescue of survivors, held the settlement together through the worst year anyone had seen. By the time order returned, she was the only authority people trusted.

### Appearance

Tall and rangy, with grey-streaked auburn hair usually bound in tight braids. A scar runs from her left ear to her jaw—a Wylltic gift from her youth. Her eyes are the pale grey of deep water, and since the Storm-Throne, they sometimes seem to *glow* faintly in low light. She dresses practically: good wool, oiled leather, always ready to go to sea at a moment's notice.

### Character

Tova is pragmatic to the bone. She doesn't care about tradition for tradition's sake, doesn't care about Imperial legitimacy, doesn't care about what the Church thinks. She cares about keeping her people alive. Everything else is negotiable.

She's also troubled. Something happened on the Storm-Throne—something she barely understands. She can do things now she couldn't do before. The storms respond to her voice. The sea whispers when she listens. She's not sure if she was given a gift or claimed by something, and she's afraid to find out.

### Goal

Keep the Fjordlands independent, fed, and safe. Build something that can survive whatever comes next. This requires balancing the old families against the newcomers, maintaining the Wylltic alliance, and preparing for threats no one can clearly see.

### Complication

The Church hasn't forgotten the north. Someone in Vandgwyn remembers that tribute has stopped, that a woman rules without Imperial sanction, that the old ways are being practiced openly. Sooner or later, someone will come to restore order. Tova doesn't know when or who, but she knows it's coming.

Also: the Storm-Throne is calling her again. She hears it in her dreams. It wants her back. She doesn't know what happens if she returns—or what happens if she refuses.

---

## Völva Yrsa Moonwhisper

**Full Name:** Yrsa Thorasdóttir, called Moonwhisper
**Role:** Seeress and spiritual leader
**Age:** 68

### Background

Yrsa was one of the last völvas trained in the old way—by apprenticeship, in secret, because the Church suppressed such things. For decades she practiced quietly, telling fortunes and mixing medicines, pretending to be nothing more than an herbalist.

The Passing freed her. When the Church's promises proved hollow and people remembered that their grandmothers had known other paths, they came to Yrsa. She's been practicing openly ever since—the most sought-after spiritual authority in the Fjordlands.

### Appearance

Small and bent with age, but her eyes are sharp as ever. White hair worn loose in defiance of practical custom. Dressed in layers of dark wool covered with embroidered symbols. She carries a staff carved with ravens and adorned with feathers and small bones. She smells of herbs and woodsmoke.

### Character

Yrsa has waited her whole life for this moment—the moment when people would remember the old ways. She's thrilled and terrified in equal measure. The old ways work. The realm-fields respond to the old stories. But working magic openly again after so long suppressed means making mistakes, rediscovering knowledge that was almost lost, dealing with forces that don't care about human convenience.

She's also genuinely wise—not infallible, but thoughtful. She knows the difference between tradition and truth, between what the old ways actually said and what people wish they'd said.

### Goal

Rebuild the network of sea-priests and völvas that once served the north. Train successors. Record knowledge before it's lost. And understand what the realm-fields are doing now—because something is different, something is wrong, and the old stories don't quite fit anymore.

### Complication

Two problems. First: some want to use the old ways for power, not wisdom. Blood magic is part of the old tradition too, and Yrsa has already refused requests she found repugnant. Not everyone accepted her refusal.

Second: her visions have become... unreliable. Since the Passing, the realm-fields don't behave as they should. Her predictions are often wrong now. She's not sure if the problem is her, or the fields, or something else entirely. A seeress who can't see clearly is a seeress losing her followers.

---

## Jarl Bjorn Wulfgård

**Full Name:** Bjorn Sigurdsson Wulfgård
**Role:** Wylltic envoy and leader of the "guest-raiders"
**Age:** 35

### Background

Bjorn was a ship-captain from Ynys Wyllt, third son of a minor lord. He led raids against the Imperial coast for a decade—not out of hatred but because that's what Wylltic men did. He was good at it, acquiring a reputation for ferocity in battle and fairness in dealing with captives.

When the Passing came, Bjorn's ship was caught at sea. Half his crew died. He made landfall at Fjordhavn seeking repairs and found the world had changed. Admiral Tova offered him a choice: alliance or death. He chose alliance, and to everyone's surprise including his own, he meant it.

### Appearance

A bear of a man—six and a half feet tall, massively muscled, red-bearded, covered in scars and tattoos. His left hand is missing two fingers from a long-ago fight. He dresses in a combination of Wylltic and Fjordlander styles, deliberately bridging cultures. His laugh is legendary; his rage is legendary too.

### Character

Bjorn is more thoughtful than he appears. Years of raiding taught him that most conflicts are stupid—people die over pride and misunderstanding, not real necessity. The alliance with Fjordhavn makes sense: the Wylltic bring skills and warriors, the Fjordlanders provide harbor and supplies. Everyone benefits.

But he's torn. Messages from Ynys Wyllt call him traitor. His family has disowned him. The old ways of his people demand he return, even if return means death. He's built something here, but he's not sure it can last.

### Goal

Make the alliance permanent. Bring over more Wylltic ships and families. Create something new—neither Fjordlander nor Wylltic but a synthesis that's stronger than either. He's started calling his people **Hafsbrœðr** (Sea-Brothers), hoping a new identity can transcend old divisions.

### Complication

Not all the Wylltic guests came for peace. Some came because home was worse, but they haven't given up raiding in their hearts. Bjorn has to keep them in line. So far he's succeeded through force of personality and the occasional brutal enforcement of discipline. But he's one man, and the guest-community is growing.

Also: Ynys Wyllt itself is in chaos. Darker things than raids are happening there. Refugees bring tales of blood-magic, of chiefs gone mad, of something stirring in the deep places. Bjorn fears that whatever is happening there will eventually come here.

---

## Father Aldhelm

**Full Name:** Aldhelm of Rivervale
**Role:** Solarian priest
**Age:** 61

### Background

Aldhelm came north as a young missionary, full of faith and certainty. He spent thirty years trying to bring Light to these stubborn people, winning few converts but never giving up. The north was his calling, his punishment, his home.

When the Passing came and the Church failed, Aldhelm didn't lose his faith—but he lost his certainty. His congregation collapsed to a handful of elderly faithful. The old ways came roaring back. Everything he'd worked for was swept away in a year.

Now he's a relic, ministering to a shrinking flock, trying to understand where his Church went wrong without abandoning his core beliefs.

### Appearance

Thin, stooped, with kind eyes and trembling hands. His Solarian robes are patched and faded—no new vestments have arrived from the south. He still conducts services in the proper form, though sometimes he's the only attendee. He speaks softly and carries no weapon.

### Character

Aldhelm is genuinely good. He believes in Light, in compassion, in the human capacity for redemption. His faith isn't in the Church as institution but in the divine truth he believes the Church represents. He's horrified by what the Scouring does in the Light's name. He's troubled by the Church's failures. But he still believes.

He's also curious. The old ways work. He's seen it. Völva Yrsa does things that look like miracles. The realm-fields respond to her. How does that fit with his understanding of the divine? He doesn't know, but he wants to find out.

### Goal

Understand what happened to his faith and whether it can be renewed. Help his remaining flock. And maybe—just maybe—find a way to bridge the gap between Solarian truth and the older truths these people have rediscovered. Not syncretism, exactly. Recognition that the Light might be bigger than the Church taught.

### Complication

Aldhelm reports to no one now—the Church hierarchy has other concerns than a failing mission in the far north. But he knows that if order is ever restored, questions will be asked. He's allowed heresy to flourish. He's failed to oppose the admiral's godless rule. He's even attended one of Yrsa's ceremonies, secretly, watching.

If the Inquisition ever comes north, Aldhelm's tolerance will be counted against him. He's not sure if he'll defend himself or accept the punishment he might deserve.

---

## Sigrid Ormsdóttir

**Full Name:** Sigrid Ormsdóttir
**Role:** Head of the Ormsson merchant family
**Age:** 52

### Background

The Ormsson family has dominated Fjordhavn's trade for five generations. Sigrid inherited control after her father's death during the Passing—he drowned trying to rescue cargo from a sinking ship, always prioritizing goods over sense.

She's had to rebuild the family business from near-ruin. Many ships lost, many warehouses burned, many debts owed that will never be paid. But the Ormssons still own the best wharves, still have the best southern contacts, still hold the ancient land-grants that give them leverage.

### Appearance

Handsome rather than beautiful, with iron-grey hair and a merchant's calculating eyes. She dresses expensively but practically—good fabric, little ornament. Her hands are ink-stained from constant accounts work. She moves with the confidence of someone who knows exactly what everything costs.

### Character

Sigrid is a survivor. She cares about her family's wealth because wealth means security, and security means survival. She's not greedy for its own sake—she's terrified of losing what she has. The Passing showed her how quickly everything can collapse.

She's also a traditionalist. The old families built Fjordhavn. The old ways worked for centuries. Admiral Tova's innovations—refugees with political voices, Wylltic raiders as guests, the þing actually mattering—threaten the established order that Sigrid understands. She's not plotting against Tova, but she's not supporting her either.

### Goal

Restore the Ormsson trading network. Reestablish connections with the south. Make enough money that her family never has to worry again. And subtly, gradually, ensure that the old families regain their proper influence. Not through coup—through commerce.

### Complication

Sigrid's eldest son died in the Passing. Her surviving children are... disappointing. Her daughter ran off with a Wylltic warrior. Her younger son prefers drinking to working. The family line continues, but the family strength doesn't. Sigrid needs an heir worthy of the name, and she's not sure where to find one.

Also: some of her southern contacts have started asking pointed questions. About Fjordhavn's defenses. About the Wylltic presence. About Admiral Tova's weaknesses. Sigrid isn't a traitor, but she's tempted by the wealth being offered. Not yet. But maybe eventually.

# Part Five: Local Conditions

## The Reft Situation

### Density

**Moderate.** The Fjordlands were sparsely populated even before the Passing, and the cold climate seems to slow Reft activity. However, the harsh conditions also make the living more vulnerable.

**Concentration Points:**
- Abandoned fishing villages along the outer coast
- The interior river valleys where refugees died fleeing
- Certain seemingly random locations where multiple Reft have gathered

### Predominant Types

| Type | Frequency | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------|
| Drowned Reft | High | Atargatis-field. Common near water; slow but persistent. Appear waterlogged. |
| Storm Reft | Moderate | Gwenaelle-field. Aggressive, crackling energy. Concentrate during bad weather. |
| Root Reft | Low | Alys-field. Rare this far north but present. Territorial around forest/tundra edges. |
| Shadow Reft | Low | Revna-field. Present in deep fjord shadows. Hard to spot. |
| Empty Reft | Very Rare | Abyss-field. Three confirmed sightings. Erased memories of those who encountered them. |

### Behavioral Notes

The Reft of the Fjordlands behave differently than southern reports suggest. They're **slower**—the cold seems to affect them despite their unnatural nature. They're also **more predictable**—following patterns that locals have learned to recognize.

**The Sitting Dead:** Many Drowned Reft remain motionless in the water, standing on the bottom, visible only when you look down. They activate when boats pass overhead.

**The Storm-Drawn:** Storm Reft become active during bad weather and seem to chase lightning. Sailors have learned to avoid them by avoiding the storm-edges where they concentrate.

**The Winter Sleep:** All Reft become less active in the deepest winter. They don't stop entirely, but they slow dramatically. This window provides opportunities for travel and clearing.

### Notable Infestations

**The Outer Coast:** The abandoned fishing villages are filled with Drowned Reft who were once their residents. Clearing them would require significant military effort.

**The Valley of Whispers (Hvíslaðalur):** An interior valley where dozens of Reft have gathered for unknown reasons. They don't leave the valley, but no one leaves the valley either. The surrounding areas have been abandoned.

**The Stórfjörð Deeps:** Something Reft-like—but much larger—occasionally surfaces in the deep parts of the Great Fjord. It hasn't attacked ships yet. It watches.

## Travel

### Water Routes

Primary transportation. The fjords are highways.

| Route | Condition | Hazards |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| Great Fjord (main channel) | Open | Reft in deep water; weather |
| Outer Coast | Dangerous | Drowned Reft villages; rocks; storms |
| Minor Fjords | Variable | Some blocked by ice or Reft |
| Ice Ocean | Impassable | Not literally, but no one goes there |

**The Whale-Roads:** Experienced navigators know the deep channels where whales swim—the **whale-roads**. These routes are generally safer because the large marine life seems to discourage Reft.

### Land Routes

Limited and difficult.

| Route | Condition | Notes |
|-------|-----------|-------|
| Fjordhavn-Hvalsund | Maintained | The main interior path |
| Coastal paths | Unmaintained | Passable in summer, deadly in winter |
| Interior tracks | Seasonal | Only in late summer; require guides |
| Mountain passes | Dangerous | Connect to Pinelands; Reft in valleys |

**Winter Travel:** Essentially impossible for outsiders. Locals with proper knowledge can use the frozen water-routes, but the risks are extreme.

### Trade

**Imports:** Grain from the south (critical). Metal goods. Manufactured items. Salt (for preservation).

**Exports:** Whale products (oil, bone, ambergris). Fish (dried, salted). Furs from inland trade. Ships (Fjordhavn builds excellent vessels).

**Current State:** Trade has collapsed to perhaps 20% of pre-Passing levels. The few ships that make the journey from the south charge enormous premiums. The Ormsson family still maintains southern connections but cannot meet demand.

**The Wylltic Factor:** Surprisingly, the Wylltic guests have opened new trade possibilities. They bring goods from Ynys Wyllt—weapons, wool, amber—that were previously unavailable except through irregular raiding-booty.

## Religion

### Actual Practice

The old ways have returned openly, though their exact form is still being negotiated.

**The Sea-Priests (Sjóprestар):** Men and women who serve as intermediaries with the sea-spirits and Atargatis. They bless ships, read weather-omens, conduct ceremonies for the dead, and perform the whale-rites that make hunting spiritually acceptable. Their numbers are growing.

**The Völvas:** Seers and healers who work with the land-spirits and ancestor-spirits. Fewer than the sea-priests but more prestigious. Yrsa Moonwhisper is the most respected, but there are others.

**The Whale-Faith:** Particularly strong in Hvalsund, this tradition treats whales as sacred prey—divine gifts that consent to being taken if proper rites are observed. The Harpooners serve as priest-warriors of this tradition.

**The Storm-Singers:** A new practice since Tova Storm-Singer survived the Storm-Throne. Small groups are attempting to learn her techniques—singing to influence weather. So far, no one else has succeeded.

### Official Religion

**Solarian Presence:** Minimal and declining. Father Aldhelm serves his handful of faithful, but the Church has no real power here. No Inquisition presence. No enforcement of religious law.

**The Watching South:** Everyone knows this can't last. The Church will eventually turn its attention north. When it does, the openly-practiced "heresies" will become problems.

### The Tensions

**Traditionalists vs. Innovators:** Some want to recreate the old religion exactly as it was. Others want to adapt it to new realities—incorporating Wylltic elements, developing new practices like storm-singing, finding ways to address realm-field phenomena that the old stories don't explain.

**The Blood Question:** Blood magic is part of the old tradition. Some practices require sacrifice—usually animals, but historically sometimes more. Where are the lines now? Yrsa Moonwhisper forbids human sacrifice. Not everyone agrees she has the authority to forbid it.

## The Scars

### Silences

**The Quiet Waters:** Several inlets have become unnaturally silent since the Passing. No birds nest there. Fish avoid them. The water itself seems to absorb sound. Anyone who spends more than a few hours in these places begins to feel... muffled. Some who've stayed longer have stopped speaking entirely.

**The Whispering Valley:** Paradoxically, one valley (Hvíslaðalur, the Valley of Whispers) isn't silent but too loud. Constant murmuring sounds, never quite identifiable. The Reft gathered there seem to be drawn by the sound—or perhaps they're creating it.

### Twistings

**The Changed Waters:** In some places, the water's properties have altered. One inlet's water will not support boats—they sink as if the water were less dense. Another inlet's water preserves anything submerged in it—bodies, wood, metal—in perfect condition indefinitely.

**The Frozen Fire:** On Varðanes headland, there's a patch of ground that's hot regardless of season—snow melts on contact, touching the rock burns. It wasn't there before the Passing.

### Memory-Wounds

**Katthöfn:** The lost village is the most dramatic example, but not the only one. At least three other sites have been forgotten—people remember that something was there, but not what. Maps show blank spaces. Locals know the blank spaces exist but become confused when trying to explain what's missing.

**The Unnamed Ship:** A vessel in Fjordhavn's harbor that no one can remember boarding. It arrived during the Passing. Its crew is gone. Its log is blank. Its cargo hold contains nothing. But it's there, and it's in perfect condition, and no one wants to claim it.

---

# Part Six: Adventure Hooks

## 1. The Whale-Speakers

**Setup:** The Harpooners of Hvalsund have noticed the whales behaving strangely. They surface in unusual patterns. They sing at wrong times. Three times now, pods have approached boats without fleeing, letting Harpooners come close enough to touch—then swimming away without any kill.

**The Mystery:** The whales appear to be trying to communicate. The Harpooners believe this, but they can't understand the message. They've asked Völva Yrsa for help, and she's sent word to Fjordhavn that she needs assistance—people with fresh perspectives, perhaps outsiders who aren't bound by the whale-faith's assumptions.

**Complications:**
- The whales may be warning about something in the deep water
- Some Harpooners see this as a chance for easy kills and want to ignore the behavior
- The whale-spirits may have their own agenda that isn't necessarily friendly
- Understanding the whales may require going into the water with them

**Potential Resolution:** The whales are trying to warn about something that's hunting them—and everything else—from the abyss. They've encountered something during their deep dives, something old and vast, something disturbed by the Passing. They want allies.

---

## 2. The Ice-Gate's Message

**Setup:** The Ísafolk haven't come to trade in over a year. The last group spoke cryptically of "wrong colors" and "the sleeper." Now the Ice-Gate itself is showing changing patterns—not random, clearly meaningful, but no one can read them.

**The Mystery:** Someone needs to cross the ice, find the Ísafolk, and learn what they know. The journey is extremely dangerous—not just the cold and the distance, but whatever the Ísafolk are afraid of.

**Complications:**
- The ice journey requires skills most Fjordlanders don't have
- The Ísafolk deliberately separated from other humans; they may not welcome contact
- The patterns on the Ice-Gate might be warnings to stay away, not invitations
- Something is out there that the Ísafolk think is worth sealing themselves away from

**Potential Resolution:** The Ísafolk discovered something during the Passing—something they did, perhaps, or something they are—that connects them to the Eldritch creatures. They're hiding because they're not sure if they're victims or collaborators. They need help understanding what they've become.

---

## 3. The Storm-Throne's Summons

**Setup:** Admiral Tova Storm-Singer has been dreaming of the Storm-Throne. It calls to her, night after night, more insistently each time. She's resisted so far, but she's beginning to feel... compelled. She needs someone to investigate the Throne while she keeps her distance.

**The Mystery:** What does the Storm-Throne want? Is it a test, a trap, a genuine offer of power? What happens to those who sit it during calm weather versus storms? What happened to others who've tried since Tova?

**Complications:**
- The Storm-Throne kills most who attempt it
- Something seems to be using the Throne as a recruitment tool
- Tova's abilities may depend on not understanding their source
- The "thing" behind the storms may not be Gwenaelle but something else wearing her form

**Potential Resolution:** The Storm-Throne is a connection to storm-spirits who've become desperate since the Passing. Their realm-field is destabilized. They're looking for mortals who can serve as anchors, stabilizing the connection between realms. The cost may be transformation into something no longer quite human.

---

## 4. The Drowned Temple's Awakening

**Setup:** The Drowned Temple is rising. Low-tide reveals more of it each month. The barnacles are dying. Lights appear in the depths. The Axis Faith dwarves have heard rumors and sent word that they want to reconsecrate the site—but they want humans to scout it first.

**The Mystery:** What awakened the temple? What's inside it now? The Forge-Seal it once contained could help stabilize realm-field fluctuations, but recovering it means entering a place that's been underwater for centuries and is now occupied by... something.

**Complications:**
- The temple is trapped—both physical traps (currents, collapsing passages) and magical ones
- Something lives in the temple now that doesn't want visitors
- The Axis Faith dwarves have their own agenda for the Forge-Seal
- The temple may be rising for reasons unconnected to anyone's benefit

**Potential Resolution:** The temple is rising because the realm-fields are thinning and the boundary between Gwenaelle's stone and Atargatis's water is shifting. The thing inside is a spirit that's been trapped there for centuries—it could be an ally or an enemy depending on how it's approached.

---

## 5. The Whale-Grave's Purpose

**Setup:** The glowing bones, the blackening sand, the arriving dead—something is building at the Whale-Grave. The sea-priests of Hvalsund are frightened but also hopeful. If the whale-spirits are gathering for something, maybe it's something that can help. But previous watchers have returned... wrong.

**The Mystery:** What are the whale-spirits doing? What happens to watchers who stay too long? The answers require spending multiple nights at the Whale-Grave, watching, documenting, possibly participating in whatever ceremony is taking shape.

**Complications:**
- The Whale-Grave affects human minds; protection is unclear
- The whale-spirits may not distinguish between watchers and offerings
- Whatever is being built may not be meant for human benefit
- The returning watchers who came back "wrong" are still in Hvalsund; what happened to them?

**Potential Resolution:** The whale-spirits are building a defense—a structure of bone and spirit that will serve as a barrier or weapon against something approaching from the deep. They need human help to complete it, but the help required involves spiritual transformation that most humans won't survive unchanged.

---

## 6. The Missing Ship

**Setup:** The unnamed ship in Fjordhavn harbor has sat for three years. No one claims it. No one remembers seeing it arrive. But recently, people have started dreaming about it—dreams where they board, where they find the crew waiting, where the ship takes them somewhere wonderful.

**The Mystery:** The dreams are too consistent to be coincidence. The ship wants something. What happens if someone actually boards it? Where does it want to go?

**Complications:**
- The ship may be a trap—but whose, and for what purpose?
- The dreams are appealing; some townsfolk are ready to board regardless of warnings
- The ship may be connected to Katiari (Abyss), a realm-field few understand
- Boarding may mean no return—or return to somewhere unexpected

**Potential Resolution:** The ship is a manifestation of the Abyss—specifically, of hope. It appeared during the Passing because hope was needed. It waits because it goes somewhere, but only for those who choose it freely. Where it leads is undefined—perhaps to Kathari herself, perhaps to somewhere that doesn't exist yet.

---

## 7. The Trader's Treachery

**Setup:** Sigrid Ormsdóttir's southern contacts have offered her a deal: detailed information about Fjordhavn's defenses in exchange for enough grain to feed the town through winter. She's refused so far. But winter is coming, and the situation is desperate.

**The Mystery:** Who is behind the offer? The Church? The Imperial remnants? Something else? What are they planning? Can the grain be obtained some other way? Can the threat be neutralized before Sigrid—or someone else—accepts?

**Complications:**
- The grain offer is genuine; people will starve without alternative supply
- Sigrid isn't the only one receiving offers; others may be less scrupulous
- The southern agents may already be in Fjordhavn, watching
- Exposing the plot may destroy the Ormsson family's trading network—the only southern connection Fjordhavn has

**Potential Resolution:** The Scouring faction of the Church is behind this—they want to know Fjordhavn's weaknesses before launching a "purification" campaign. The information could be used to strengthen defenses, feed disinformation, or set a trap. The grain could potentially be obtained through the Wylltic network instead, if the Hafsbrœðr can be convinced to help.
