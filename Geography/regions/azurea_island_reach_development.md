# Azurea: Island Reach Sub-Region Development
## Regio Insularum / Ynysfor ("Island-Sea")

---

# Overview

The Island Reach is a volcanic archipelago of hundreds of islands scattered across the contested waters between the Empire's eastern coast and the Shiranui homelands. Neither fully Imperial nor Shiranui, the islands have developed their own creole culture—a pragmatic blend of every tradition that washes up on their shores.

Before the Passing, the Island Reach was a crucial node in east-west trade, generating enormous wealth for those who controlled the sea lanes. Allegiances shifted constantly; an island might pay tribute to the Empire one decade and to Shiranui the next, depending on who offered better terms or who showed up with more ships.

Since the Passing, the chaos has intensified. Some islands were devastated—entire populations converted to Reft or simply vanished. Others were spared entirely, their residents convinced they must have done something right (though no one agrees what). The old trade networks have fractured, allegiances mean nothing, and survival has become the only currency that matters.

**Imperial Name:** Regio Insularum
**Local Name:** Ynysfor (Welsh/Brythonic creole: "Island-Sea")
**Trade-Tongue Name:** Shimakai (Japanese-influenced: "Sea of Islands")
**Capital:** Portus Medius
**City Density:** Low — approximately 1 major settlement per island group, scattered
**Population (Pre-Passing):** ~45,000 across all islands
**Population (Post-Passing):** ~18,000 (highly variable; some islands empty, others overcrowded with refugees)

# Part One: The Capital City

## Portus Medius — The Middle Port

### Names and Meaning

| Language | Name | Meaning |
|----------|------|---------|
| Imperial | Portus Medius | "Middle Port" (between Empire and Shiranui) |
| Trade-Creole | Naka-Portho | Blend of Shiranui and Imperial |
| Islanders | Yr Ynys Fawr | "The Great Island" |
| Shiranui | Chūkō | "Central Harbor" |

The name reflects the settlement's identity: positioned precisely between powers, belonging fully to neither, profiting from both.

### Location

Portus Medius occupies the largest island in the central archipelago—a volcanic cone that rises from deep water to a peak of 2,400 feet. The town itself clusters around a natural caldera harbor on the island's southern side, where ancient volcanic activity created a sheltered bay nearly a mile across.

**The Island (Ynys Fawr):**
- Volcanic origin, dormant but not extinct
- Fresh water springs from the heights (rare and precious in the archipelago)
- Terraced gardens climbing the lower slopes
- Dense tropical-temperate forest on the windward side
- Rocky, barren leeward coast

**The Harbor (Porthladd Cylch):**
- Natural caldera, partially collapsed seaward
- Deep water access for large vessels
- Multiple stone quays built over centuries
- Breakwater constructed from volcanic stone
- Can shelter 200+ vessels in calm conditions

### Scale

| Period | Population | Notes |
|--------|------------|-------|
| Pre-Passing | ~12,000 | Peak prosperity, major trading hub |
| During Passing | ~3,000 | Mass exodus, plague |
| Post-Passing (Year 7) | ~6,000 | Partial recovery, refugee influx |

The current population is unstable—ships arrive with refugees from devastated islands, others depart seeking safer waters. The permanent population is perhaps 4,000; the rest are transients, traders, and those who haven't decided whether to stay.

### The Five Districts

#### 1. The Quays (Y Ceiau)

The waterfront district where all business ultimately happens.

**Character:**
- Stone wharves extending into the caldera harbor
- Warehouse complexes built from volcanic stone and imported timber
- Counting houses, weighing stations, customs offices
- The great crane that can lift cargo from the largest ships
- Taverns, boarding houses, brothels for sailors
- The smell of salt, tar, fish, and foreign spices

**Notable Features:**
- **The Weighmaster's Tower** — Where all goods are assessed and taxed; whoever controls this controls the port
- **The Long Wharf** — Reserved for Shiranui vessels; Shiranui-style architecture, their rules apply
- **The Empire Dock** — Technically Imperial territory; rarely enforced now
- **The Chandler's Row** — Ship supplies, repairs, everything a vessel needs

**Atmosphere:** Constant activity. Multiple languages. The clink of scales, the creak of cranes, the arguments of merchants. At night, the taverns roar until dawn.

#### 2. The Terraces (Y Terasau)

Residential district climbing the lower slopes above the harbor.

**Character:**
- Terraced houses built into the hillside
- Mixed architectural styles (Imperial columns, Shiranui sliding screens, local volcanic stone)
- Narrow stepped streets too steep for carts
- Cisterns catching rainwater
- Small gardens wherever soil can be held
- Views across the harbor and surrounding sea

**Notable Features:**
- **The Merchants' Quarter** — Upper terraces where successful traders build elaborate homes
- **The Old Consulates** — Former diplomatic buildings, now private residences or boarding houses
- **The Switchback** — Main stair-street connecting harbor to heights, 400+ steps
- **The Cistern Gardens** — Public squares built around water collection systems

**Atmosphere:** Quieter than the quays, but never silent. Children playing in streets too narrow for carts. Laundry hanging between buildings. The smell of cooking from a dozen different cuisines.

#### 3. The Grove (Y Llwyn)

The temple district, built around the island's sacred spring.

**Character:**
- Centered on the Spring of Sweet Water (rare fresh water source)
- Temples to multiple traditions arranged in careful neutrality
- Gardens irrigated by the spring's overflow
- Pilgrimage hostels and ritual spaces
- The oldest part of the settlement

**Notable Features:**
- **The Temple of Seven Waters** — Multi-faith complex where the spring emerges; shrines to Light, Dark, Life, Death, Sea, and two empty niches (one for Alys, one for... something else)
- **The Shiranui Shrine** — Kōrei worship space, maintained by Shiranui community
- **The Chapel of the Drowned** — Ostaran temple for those lost at sea
- **The Kasandran Garden** — Fertility shrine, discrete but well-attended
- **The Spring House** — Where water is collected and distributed; effectively sacred ground

**Atmosphere:** Peaceful. The sound of water. Incense from multiple traditions mixing into something unique. Pilgrims of all faiths treating each other with careful respect.

#### 4. The Heights (Y Ucheldiroedd)

The upper town where those with power live.

**Character:**
- Cooler air, fresher water, better views
- Walled compounds of the wealthy
- Administrative buildings
- The Governor's residence (when there was a governor)
- Military installations (such as they are)

**Notable Features:**
- **The Praetorium** — Former Imperial governor's palace; now occupied by Trade-Master Callista
- **The Signal Tower** — Communication post visible from surrounding islands
- **The Windcatcher Halls** — Shiranui-style buildings designed to channel sea breezes
- **The Arsenal** — Where what remains of the town's defenses is stored

**Atmosphere:** Quiet, watchful, political. The servants gossip more than the masters speak openly. Every dinner invitation is a negotiation.

#### 5. The Floating Quarter (Y Cwarter Arnofio)

Not on land at all—the community of permanently moored vessels in the harbor.

**Character:**
- Dozens of ships that no longer sail, converted to permanent habitation
- Connected by plank bridges and rope walkways
- Poorest residents and those who want no address
- Nominally under no jurisdiction
- A community unto itself

**Notable Features:**
- **The Hulk Market** — Trading happens on deck of a gutted merchantman
- **The Rat's Nest** — Notorious tavern in a decommissioned warship's hull
- **The Drowned Temple** — Half-sunk vessel converted to Ostaran worship space
- **The Connector** — Massive raft platform serving as the quarter's central "square"

**Atmosphere:** Constantly moving (literally—the platforms shift with tides). Lawless in the best and worst senses. Where those who can't afford land or those fleeing land-based troubles find community.

### Landmarks

#### The Weighmaster's Tower

A four-story stone structure at the center of the quays, built around a massive bronze scale capable of weighing cargo by the ton. Whoever controls the Tower controls the port—all legitimate trade must pass through its assessments.

**Architecture:** Solid volcanic stone base, imported marble upper floors (from an era of wealth that may not return), bronze-fitted windows, the great scale mechanism visible through open doors.

**Current Status:** Controlled by Trade-Master Callista's customs officers. The mechanisms still work. The records are still kept. This continuity is the main reason Portus Medius hasn't collapsed entirely.

#### The Broken Spire

Once a lighthouse-minaret built by the pre-Imperial peoples who first settled these islands. The upper third collapsed during the Passing—whether from earthquake, eldritch touch, or simple age, no one knows.

**Location:** The harbor entrance, on a rocky promontory.

**Current Status:** Still used as a signal tower and navigation landmark. The broken top has been capped with a brazier platform. At night, the fire guides ships through the harbor mouth.

**Local Legend:** The spire was built by giants before the Hawthorne's creation. Its fall during the Passing was ominous—but of what?

#### The Temple of Seven Waters

The multi-faith complex surrounding the sweet-water spring. Seven alcoves around a central pool, each dedicated to a different tradition. Two of the seven niches stand empty—one clearly abandoned (its carvings defaced), one that locals insist was always empty but is clearly sized for a statue.

**The Empty Niches:** 
- The defaced one was dedicated to Alys, destroyed during a Church persecution wave two centuries ago
- The "always empty" one troubles scholars—records suggest it was occupied, but no one can remember by what

**Current Status:** Functional, ecumenical, essential. The spring provides most of the settlement's drinking water. All factions maintain the peace here.

#### The Gallows Rocks

A cluster of sea-stacks at the harbor mouth where pirates were traditionally hanged, their bodies left for birds and sea.

**Current Status:** Not used for executions anymore (who would enforce such sentences?). The iron cages still hang, rusting. Local children dare each other to swim out to them. Some say the ghosts of hanged pirates give warnings of approaching danger—or approaching opportunity, depending on whom you ask.

### Who Rules

**Before the Passing:** An Imperial Governor appointed by the provincial administration in Portus Aureus, advised by a Council of Captains representing the major trading interests. The Governor had theoretical authority; the Council had actual power; they negotiated constantly.

**During the Passing:** The last Governor, Marcus Severus, died of the plague. His staff fled. Imperial authority evaporated.

**Now:** 

**Trade-Master Callista** (see Key Figures) has claimed the title of Acting Governor and controls the Praetorium, the Weighmaster's Tower, and what passes for a customs service. She has no legal authority but has actual power—specifically, the power to tax trade and hire guards.

The **Council of Captains** still meets, now including pirate captains alongside legitimate merchants. They recognize Callista's authority because it's convenient, not because it's legitimate.

The **Shiranui Factor** maintains that the Shiranui portion of the waterfront (the Long Wharf) is sovereign Shiranui territory and beyond Callista's jurisdiction. This is mostly respected.

**The Floating Quarter** recognizes no authority at all and polices itself through rough consensus and rougher violence.

### The Tension

Everyone is waiting to see which external power will reassert control—if any will.

**The Imperial Question:** Does anyone in Portus Aureus or the Heartland care about the Island Reach anymore? Some believe the Empire will eventually restore authority. Others think the Empire is finished and the islands must forge their own path.

**The Shiranui Question:** Will Shiranui expand into the power vacuum? Their traders have deep pockets and their shrine-keepers have actual spiritual authority. But Shiranui has its own problems since the Passing.

**The Pirate Question:** The line between pirate and merchant has always been blurry in the islands. Now it's essentially dissolved. If legitimate trade doesn't recover, piracy becomes the only option—but piracy without trade to prey upon is just starvation with more steps.

**The Survival Question:** Can this many people survive on these islands without the east-west trade flowing? The population may have already exceeded what local resources can sustain.

# Part Two: Secondary Settlements

## 1. Aoshima — The Blue Island

### Names and Meaning

| Language | Name | Meaning |
|----------|------|---------|
| Shiranui | Aoshima | "Blue Island" |
| Imperial | Insula Caerulea | "Blue Island" (rarely used) |
| Trade-Creole | Shimalas | Blend of terms |

### Location and Character

The easternmost major settlement in the Island Reach, positioned closer to Shiranui than to the Empire. Aoshima is the primary Shiranui presence in the contested zone—a carefully maintained outpost of Shiranui culture, law, and religion.

The island itself is smaller than Ynys Fawr but remarkably beautiful: volcanic in origin but heavily forested, with waterfalls cascading from central heights into a lagoon harbor of striking blue-green water (hence the name).

**Population:** Pre-Passing ~4,000; Post-Passing ~2,800

### Physical Description

- **Harbor:** Natural lagoon protected by a coral-and-volcanic reef
- **Town:** Built in Shiranui style—wooden buildings with curved roofs, sliding panels, raised walkways
- **Temples:** Prominent Kōrei shrines dominating the heights
- **Gardens:** Meticulously maintained; even now, gardeners tend the public spaces
- **The Torii Gate:** A great vermillion arch at the harbor entrance, marking the boundary of Shiranui-governed territory

### Governance

Aoshima is governed by a **Factor** appointed from Shiranui itself—currently Factor Yamamoto Reiko. Unlike the anarchic situation elsewhere in the islands, here there is clear authority, clear law, and clear consequences for violating either.

**The Rules:**
- No weapons permitted in the inner town (enforced)
- Disputes resolved by the Factor's court
- Shiranui criminal law applies to all (harsh but consistent)
- Foreigners may trade but not own property
- Religious observances are mandatory for residents

### Post-Passing State

Aoshima weathered the Passing better than most—the Kōrei shrines apparently provided some protection, or the island was simply lucky. The population decline came from Shiranui's quarantine policies: when the plague struck, Factor Yamamoto ordered the harbor closed. Those who tried to flee were turned back. Those already outside were not permitted to return.

This ruthlessness saved the settlement. It also created lasting bitterness among those whose family members died on the wrong side of the harbor chain.

**Current Situation:** Stable, prosperous (by post-Passing standards), rigidly controlled. A stark contrast to the chaos elsewhere. Some islanders look at Aoshima with envy; others with horror.

### Notable Feature: The Archive of Tides

Aoshima maintains meticulous records of shipping, weather, and trade going back centuries. The Archive of Tides is housed in a fireproof stone building (unusual for Shiranui architecture) and contains irreplaceable information about sea routes, currents, and the islands themselves.

Scholars from multiple traditions would pay well to access it. Factor Yamamoto allows access—for a price, and under supervision.

## 2. Freeport — The Pirate Haven

### Names and Meaning

| Language | Name | Meaning |
|----------|------|---------|
| Trade-Creole | Freeport | Self-explanatory |
| Imperial | Portus Liber | "Free Port" |
| Islanders | Porth y Lladron | "Port of Thieves" |
| Shiranui | Kaizoku-minato | "Pirate Harbor" |

Everyone knows what Freeport is. The name is honest.

### Location and Character

A cluster of islands in the western reaches, closer to the Empire's coast than to Shiranui. The main settlement occupies a defensible cove on the largest island, surrounded by a maze of smaller islets, shoals, and channels that only locals can navigate safely.

**The Geography as Defense:** The approach to Freeport is deadly for anyone who doesn't know the way. Submerged rocks, unpredictable currents, narrow channels—the islands themselves are the wall. Imperial naval expeditions have tried to reduce Freeport three times in history; all three failed to even reach the harbor.

**Population:** Pre-Passing ~3,500; Post-Passing ~4,200 (one of few places that grew, as pirates and refugees flocked to it)

### Physical Description

- **Harbor:** Chaotic collection of jetties, many built from salvaged ships
- **Town:** No planning whatsoever; structures built wherever there was space
- **Architecture:** Scavenged materials, salvage, improvisation
- **The Fortress:** A single stone structure on the heights—ancient, pre-Imperial, no one knows who built it
- **The Market:** Everything is for sale, no questions asked

### Governance

Freeport has no government in any normal sense. What it has is an understanding.

**The Pirate Code:** An unwritten set of conventions that make the anarchy functional:
- No fighting in the Market
- Contracts signed in Freeport are binding (enforced by collective ostracism of oath-breakers)
- Captured sailors who don't resist are ransomed, not killed
- Ships in harbor are neutral—feuds are settled elsewhere
- The Fortress is neutral ground for negotiations

**The Council of Captains (Freeport version):** The most successful pirate captains meet informally to coordinate—preventing competition from becoming destruction. Membership is fluid; if you command a crew and take prizes, you have a voice.

### Post-Passing State

The Passing changed Freeport less than anywhere else. It was already lawless, already surviving on its own terms, already adapted to danger.

What changed: the prizes got scarcer. With legitimate trade disrupted, there's less to prey upon. Some crews have turned to raiding coastal settlements directly. Others have become escorts for those willing to pay for protection. The line between pirate and privateer was always blurry; now it's invisible.

**The Refugee Question:** Freeport is one of the few places that accepts anyone, no questions asked. This has swelled the population but strained resources. The Council is debating whether to restrict newcomers—but how do you close an open port?

### Notable Feature: The Fortress of No Name

The ancient stone fortification on Freeport's heights predates any known civilization. Its architecture matches nothing—not Imperial, not Shiranui, not Goleuwyr. The stones are fitted without mortar and have not shifted in recorded history.

The pirates use it for negotiations and storage. They call it "the Fortress" and don't speculate about who built it. Some things are better not questioned.

**The Inner Chamber:** At the fortress's heart is a sealed door that no one has ever opened. Carvings around it are in no known language. The pirates leave offerings before it, not knowing to whom—just in case.

---

## 3. The Crossing — The Contested Port

### Names and Meaning

| Language | Name | Meaning |
|----------|------|---------|
| Imperial | Transitus | "The Crossing" |
| Trade-Creole | Crossing-port | Obvious |
| Islanders | Yr Groesfordd | "The Crossroads" |
| Shiranui | Watari-shima | "Crossing Island" |

### Location and Character

A strategic island positioned almost exactly between Portus Medius and Aoshima, at the point where the major shipping lanes intersect. Whoever controls the Crossing controls the flow of trade through the central archipelago.

This is why it changes hands so often.

**Population:** Pre-Passing ~2,000; Post-Passing ~800 (war, plague, and flight have emptied it)

### Physical Description

- **Harbor:** Excellent natural port with deep water on two sides
- **Fortifications:** Extensive but damaged—walls show scars from multiple sieges
- **Town:** Half-ruined, half-occupied; buildings repaired, abandoned, repaired again
- **The Lighthouse:** A great tower at the island's highest point, visible for miles (when lit)
- **The Burned Quarter:** Section destroyed in fighting that's never been rebuilt

### The Cycle of Conquest

In the century before the Passing, the Crossing changed hands seven times:

1. Imperial naval occupation (established customs post)
2. Shiranui "defensive action" (trade dispute)
3. Imperial recapture (significant casualties)
4. "Independence" (local merchants bribed both sides to leave)
5. Pirate occupation (brief, violent)
6. Shiranui "restoration of order" (at merchants' request)
7. Imperial reassertion (last action before Passing)

The Passing killed the Imperial garrison. No one has officially claimed the island since.

### Post-Passing State

The Crossing is a ghost of itself. A few hundred residents cling to the port, maintaining the lighthouse (essential for navigation) and trading with whoever arrives. Various factions eye the island, but no one has moved to take it.

**Why Not?** Taking the Crossing means holding it. Holding it means defending it. Defending it means committing resources that no faction can spare. So it sits, unclaimed, essential, slowly crumbling.

**The Current "Authority":** A woman named Keeper Wyn maintains the lighthouse and claims no other power. People respect her because she keeps the light burning. That's enough.

### Notable Feature: The Treaty Stones

At the harbor's edge stand three great stones, each carved with the terms of a different treaty that granted the Crossing to a different power. All three are technically still in effect. All three contradict each other.

Scholars call it "the world's most documented territorial dispute." Locals call it "why we can't have nice things."

---

## 4. Sulfur Cay — The Fire Island

### Names and Meaning

| Language | Name | Meaning |
|----------|------|---------|
| Imperial | Caia Sulphuris | "Sulfur Cay" |
| Trade-Creole | Smokeport | Common name |
| Islanders | Ynys Dân | "Fire Island" |
| Shiranui | Io-jima | "Sulfur Island" |

### Location and Character

The most volcanically active island in the chain—a smoking cone that regularly vents sulfurous fumes and occasionally spits fire. Settled despite the danger because of what the volcano provides: sulfur, obsidian, and hot springs.

**Population:** Pre-Passing ~1,200; Post-Passing ~600

### Physical Description

- **The Cone:** Active volcano, central feature, constantly smoking
- **Sulfur Flats:** Yellow-stained areas where sulfur is harvested
- **Obsidian Fields:** Volcanic glass deposits, valuable for blades and trade
- **Hot Springs:** Thermal pools used for bathing, healing, and religious purposes
- **The Settlement:** Huddled on the island's eastern shore, as far from the cone as geography allows

### Economy

Sulfur Cay exists for extraction. The sulfur is used in alchemy, medicine, and (importantly) the fire-powder that Tyrlóng has been developing. The obsidian makes excellent blades for those who can't afford steel. The hot springs attract those seeking healing.

**The Work:** Dangerous. Sulfur gatherers wear masks and work in shifts. Cave-ins, gas vents, and sudden eruptions kill workers regularly. The pay is high because the labor is deadly.

### Post-Passing State

The Passing barely touched Sulfur Cay—the volcano apparently discouraged whatever moved through. Locals credit the fire-spirits. The population decline came from disrupted trade; with fewer buyers for sulfur, fewer workers were needed.

**Current Situation:** Operating at reduced capacity. The Tyrlóng Alchemists' Guild maintains a permanent factor here, paying premium prices for sulfur. This keeps the island viable when other settlements have collapsed.

### Notable Feature: The Fire Temple

A Kasandran shrine built into the volcanic slopes, where the hot springs emerge from the rock. The priests here worship life-as-transformation, fire-as-renewal. They provide healing (the mineral waters do help certain conditions) and perform fertility rituals in the steam caves.

The Church considered this flagrant paganism and sent missionaries three times. All three groups left quickly. The volcano's rumbling convinced them that their presence was unwelcome.

---

## 5. Pearl Shoals — The Diving Grounds

### Names and Meaning

| Language | Name | Meaning |
|----------|------|---------|
| Imperial | Vadae Margaritae | "Pearl Shallows" |
| Trade-Creole | Pearl-banks | Common name |
| Islanders | Traeth Perlau | "Pearl Beach" |
| Shiranui | Shinju-se | "Pearl Shallows" |

### Location and Character

Not an island but a settlement built on stilts above the shallow banks where pearl-oysters grow. The richest pearl grounds in the known world, producing gems that adorned emperors and empresses.

**Population:** Pre-Passing ~1,800 (highly seasonal); Post-Passing ~500 (year-round)

### Physical Description

- **The Platforms:** Wooden structures on stilts, connected by bridges
- **The Diving Stations:** Where divers descend to harvest oysters
- **The Sorting Houses:** Where pearls are graded and prepared for market
- **The Oyster Farms:** Cultivated beds maintained by generations of divers
- **No Land:** The settlement touches no dry ground; everything is built over water

### The Divers

Pearl diving is hereditary work. Families have harvested these banks for centuries, developing techniques passed from parent to child: breath control, depth management, oyster selection. The best divers can stay under for three minutes or more.

**The Diving Families:** Six extended families control the pearl trade. They compete fiercely but maintain collective ownership of the banks themselves—no outsiders permitted.

### Post-Passing State

The pearl market collapsed with the empire. Who buys luxury goods during catastrophe? The diving families pivoted to food: oysters are edible, and the shallow banks support other shellfish too. They've survived by eating what they used to sell.

**The Hidden Wealth:** The families retained their pearl stocks when the trade died. Warehouses of gems sit beneath the sorting houses, waiting for stability to return. If it returns. Some family elders have lived their entire adult lives without selling a pearl.

### Notable Feature: The Sunken Village

Beneath the current settlement, visible through clear water, lie the remains of an older structure—a village that existed before anyone realized the banks could be harvested from above. The sunken buildings are made of coral and shell, grown rather than built.

**Who Lived There?** The diving families claim they built it, but the architecture doesn't match their traditions. Some suggest it was an Atargatan settlement—the Shio-Gatis perhaps, in their tidal phase. Others think it's older, from before the current peoples arrived.

Divers report seeing lights in the sunken village during storms. The families don't investigate.

# Part Three: Notable Sites

## 1. The Dragon's Teeth

### Location
A formation of volcanic sea-stacks arranged in an arc across a major shipping channel, approximately thirty miles east of Portus Medius. Navigation through the Teeth requires precise knowledge; the gaps shift with tides, and underwater extensions have torn the bottoms out of countless ships.

### Description
Eleven great pillars of black volcanic rock rising from deep water, ranging from fifty to two hundred feet tall. At low tide, the underwater ridge connecting them becomes visible—a jagged wall extending half a mile. At high tide, ships can pass through certain gaps. At mid-tide, the currents become murderous.

**The Passage:** Local pilots know the safe times and routes. Their knowledge is worth their weight in gold—and they charge accordingly.

**The Wrecks:** The seabed between the Teeth is carpeted with broken ships, some centuries old. Salvage crews work the shallower wrecks when conditions allow.

### History
Legend says the Teeth are actual dragon teeth, planted by a wyrm to protect something in these waters. More prosaic scholars note they're clearly volcanic. Both explanations may be true—who says dragons can't grow from volcanoes?

### Current State
The Passage remains the fastest route through the central archipelago—when it's passable. Pilots stationed on the Teeth guide ships through for substantial fees. During the Passing, several pilots simply vanished; their knowledge died with them, and some safe routes have been lost.

### The Hook
Recently, divers working the wrecks have reported seeing lights deep below—not bioluminescence, but structured light, as if from buildings. Something may be waking in the Dragon's Teeth.

---

## 2. The Whispering Caldera

### Location
A collapsed volcanic cone on an uninhabited island in the southern reaches. The caldera contains a deep lake of unusual properties.

### Description
The caldera is roughly a mile across, with walls rising 500 feet on three sides. The fourth side collapsed into the sea, creating a narrow channel where salt water mixes with the lake. The water itself is deep, dark, and perfectly still on windless days.

**The Whispers:** Sound behaves strangely here. Words spoken on one side of the caldera can be heard clearly on the opposite shore. At certain times—dawn, dusk, the dark of the moon—people report hearing voices from the water itself. Not words in any known language, but clearly voices.

### History
Before the Empire reached the islands, the native peoples used this site for prophecy. Seekers would camp on the caldera rim and listen for three nights. The voices, supposedly, would tell them what they needed to know—though often in riddles.

The Empire banned the practice as superstition. The Church called it demon-worship. The island was officially declared off-limits.

People still come.

### Current State
Without Imperial authority to enforce the ban, the Whispering Caldera has become accessible again. A few hopeful prophets camp on the rim, listening. Most hear nothing but their own thoughts echoing. A few hear... something else.

### The Hook
Since the Passing, the whispers have changed. Those who listen now report hearing the same phrase repeatedly, in that unknown language. A Shiranui scholar has tentatively translated it as: "She waits. She hopes. Remember."

---

## 3. The Drowned Shrine

### Location
A submerged temple complex visible from the surface in clear conditions, approximately two hours' sail south of Aoshima. Depth: 40-60 feet.

### Description
A complete temple complex—walls, columns, courtyards, altar—resting on the seabed as if simply lowered there. The architecture matches no known tradition: neither Imperial nor Shiranui nor Goleuwyr. The stone appears to be volcanic, but carved with tools of a sophistication that pre-dates known metalworking.

**The Preservation:** The temple is remarkably intact. Structures this old should show more decay. The carvings remain sharp. The columns stand straight. Some force has preserved it.

**The Inhabitants:** The temple is not empty. Schools of fish swirl around it, but larger shapes have been seen—things that move with purpose, that retreat into the central shrine when approached.

### History
No one knows who built it. No records describe its construction or abandonment. The islanders have always known it was there; they avoid it.

**The Atargatan Connection:** Abgal-Tako (cephalopod sages) from Coral-Crown reportedly visited the shrine generations ago. They refuse to speak of what they found. When pressed, they indicate only that the temple belongs to "the Old Flows"—which may mean ancient Atargatan traditions, or something else entirely.

### Current State
Accessible by free-diving (barely) or by those with water-breathing capabilities. Most locals consider the attempt foolish; the things in the temple do not welcome visitors.

### The Hook
A Dragon-kin philosopher recently arrived in Portus Medius, seeking divers willing to explore the shrine. She believes it may contain records of the pre-Hawthorne era—information about how the world worked before the barrier was raised. She's paying well. She's also not explaining why she's so interested.

---

## 4. The Beacon Chain

### Location
A series of seven islands stretching from near Portus Medius toward the Shiranui homelands. Each island bears a signal tower; together, they form a communication network spanning the archipelago.

### Description
Seven stone towers, each built on the highest point of its island. Each is equipped with a great brazier, a signaling mirror, and a bell. In clear conditions, a message can travel the full length of the chain—180 miles—in under an hour.

**The Code:** A complex system of light-flashes, smoke-puffs, and bell-rings that can communicate detailed messages. The code is known to trained Beacon-Keepers and jealously guarded.

### History
Built by the Empire two centuries ago, during a period of cooperation with Shiranui. The chain was intended to warn both powers of approaching threats (pirates, storms, hostile fleets) and to facilitate coordinated trade protection.

The cooperation didn't last, but the beacons did.

### Current State
Four of the seven stations remain manned. The Beacon-Keepers are a quasi-religious order, pledged to maintain the towers regardless of political changes. They are technically neutral, passing messages for anyone who pays the fee.

**The Gaps:** Three towers are dark—their keepers died during the Passing, and no replacements have been trained. This leaves dangerous gaps in the network.

### The Hook
The Chief Keeper has sent word to Portus Medius: something is killing the Beacon-Keepers. Three deaths in six months, all on isolated towers. The Chief suspects murder but has no idea who or why. She's offering substantial payment for investigators.

---

## 5. The Spawning Grounds

### Location
A cluster of small islands and underwater caves approximately fifty miles northwest of Freeport. The area is sacred to the Atargatan peoples and essential to the archipelago's fishing economy.

### Description
Warm volcanic vents create an unusually productive marine environment. Dozens of fish species spawn here, including several found nowhere else. The underwater caves are home to giant octopi, sea serpents, and allegedly stranger things.

**The Shio-Gatis Settlement:** A small community of the tide-changed people maintains a presence here, living between the islands and the caves. They consider themselves guardians of the Grounds.

### History
The Spawning Grounds have fed the archipelago for as long as people have lived here. Various powers have tried to claim them—all have learned that the Shio-Gatis won't tolerate interference, and that the sea has ways of expressing displeasure.

### Current State
Fishing continues, carefully managed by the Shio-Gatis to prevent overharvesting. Since the Passing, they've become more territorial, driving away vessels they deem too greedy.

**The New Concern:** The water around the Grounds has changed. It's slightly warmer than before, and the fish are behaving strangely—some species have abandoned their usual spawning caves, others are spawning out of season. The Shio-Gatis say the "deep fire" has shifted, but they don't know why.

### The Hook
A Shio-Gatis elder has approached outsiders for the first time in living memory. Something is wrong in the deepest caves—something that frightens even the sea-folk. She won't say what, only that she needs people who can breathe air to investigate the volcanic vents where her people cannot go.

# Part Four: Key Figures

## 1. Trade-Master Callista Varro

### Role
Acting Governor of Portus Medius; de facto ruler of the central archipelago; controller of the Weighmaster's Tower and its customs service.

### Appearance
Fifty-three years old. Tall, lean, weathered by decades of island sun. Silver-streaked dark hair worn short. Missing the last two fingers of her left hand (old injury, never discusses it). Dresses in practical merchant's clothing rather than official robes. Her eyes never stop calculating.

### Background
Born in Portus Medius to a shipping family, Callista spent her young adulthood sailing trade routes between the Empire and Shiranui. She survived two pirate attacks (losing her fingers in the second) before transitioning to harbor administration. When the Governor died during the Passing, she was Deputy Customs Master. She stepped into the vacuum because someone had to.

### Personality
Pragmatic to the point of coldness. Callista doesn't care about ideology, tradition, or legitimacy—she cares about what works. She's kept Portus Medius functioning through sheer competence and a willingness to make deals with anyone. She'll negotiate with pirates if it keeps trade flowing. She'll ignore religious differences if both sides keep the peace.

Her one moral line: she won't tolerate those who prey on the desperate. Slavers, loan-sharks who ruin families, merchants who hoard food during crisis—she deals with them harshly.

### Goal
Survival—of herself, of Portus Medius, of the islands as a functioning trading community. She believes that if the east-west trade revives, everything else will follow. Her entire focus is on keeping the port operational until that day.

### Complication
She has no legitimate authority. Everyone knows it. The Council of Captains tolerates her because she's useful, but if a real power—Imperial, Shiranui, or otherwise—asserts control, her position evaporates. She's gambling that competence will be worth more than legitimacy. It's a gamble she might lose.

### Resources
- Control of the Weighmaster's Tower (taxation, records, leverage)
- A private guard of forty loyal fighters
- Detailed knowledge of every captain and merchant in the islands
- A network of informants on most major islands
- Grudging respect from all factions (worth more than it sounds)

## 2. Captain Marek "Red-Hand" Voss

### Role
Most successful pirate captain in the Island Reach; informal leader of the Freeport Council of Captains; the man everyone fears and respects in equal measure.

### Appearance
Early forties, but looks older—piracy ages you. Heavily built, barrel-chested, scarred across face and arms. Completely bald by choice (shaves daily—lice prevention). His right hand is stained permanently red from an alchemical accident; the stain won't fade. Three gold teeth. Voice like gravel in a tin cup.

### Background
Born in Ynys Wyllt, the Wild Isle. Went to sea at twelve on a raiding vessel. Captured by Imperial navy at seventeen, escaped at nineteen, made his way to the Island Reach. Worked as a sailor, then first mate, then captain after the previous captain "fell overboard" during a disagreement. Has commanded the *Sea-Wolf* for sixteen years.

### Personality
Surprisingly thoughtful for a pirate. Marek reads extensively (mostly stolen books) and can discuss philosophy, navigation, or theology with equal facility. He's also capable of extreme violence and has ordered men keelhauled for betrayal. He sees no contradiction—the world is hard, and he does what survival requires.

He maintains a strict personal code: never harm women or children, always honor ransoms, never betray someone who's trusted you. He's broken all these rules at least once and hates himself for it.

### Goal
Legitimacy. Marek is tired of being a pirate. He wants to become something respectable—a merchant prince, a naval commander, a founding father of whatever the islands become. He's quietly building toward a position where he can negotiate amnesty, but he needs leverage to make that deal.

### Complication
His past won't stay buried. He's made too many enemies, broken too many rules, killed too many people. Someone is always looking for revenge, and his crew contains at least one informant (he's not sure who) reporting to... someone.

### Resources
- The *Sea-Wolf*: fast, well-armed brigantine with experienced crew
- Respect/fear from Freeport's community
- Detailed knowledge of hidden anchorages and naval weaknesses
- A fortune in stolen goods hidden across multiple islands
- Connections to Ynys Wyllt raiders (estranged but still family)

---

## 3. Factor Yamamoto Reiko

### Role
Shiranui Factor (governor) of Aoshima; highest-ranking Shiranui official in the Island Reach; representative of the Tennō's interests.

### Appearance
Sixty-one years old. Small, contained, impeccably dressed in Shiranui formal wear. Every hair in place, every gesture deliberate. Her face reveals nothing she doesn't intend to reveal. When she speaks, everyone listens—not because she's loud (she never raises her voice) but because her words are precisely chosen.

### Background
Born to a noble family in Shiranui's capital. Career bureaucrat who rose through merit rather than connections (unusual). Assigned to Aoshima twenty years ago as punishment for political enemies—the islands were considered a backwater. She's transformed the posting into a power base.

### Personality
Utterly controlled. Reiko has emotions—she just never allows them to affect her decisions. She's capable of compassion (she houses Shiranui refugees at her own expense) and ruthlessness (she ordered the harbor closed during the Passing, knowing it meant death for those outside).

She believes deeply in order, hierarchy, and proper behavior. The chaos of the post-Passing islands offends her on a fundamental level. She would bring order to the entire archipelago if she had the resources.

### Goal
Expand Shiranui influence throughout the Island Reach while the Empire is weak. She envisions the islands as a Shiranui protectorate—orderly, prosperous, spiritually grounded in Kōrei worship. This isn't imperialism in her mind; it's rescue.

### Complication
Her superiors in Shiranui have other priorities. The homeland was wounded by the Passing too; they can't spare resources for western expansion. Reiko is operating largely on her own, making promises she may not be able to keep. If the Tennō's government decides the islands aren't worth the investment, her position collapses.

### Resources
- The administrative apparatus of Aoshima (functional, disciplined)
- Shiranui merchant factors throughout the islands
- The shrine-keepers (religious legitimacy among Shiranui-tradition followers)
- The Archive of Tides (information is power)
- Personal wealth accumulated over twenty years

## 4. Keeper Wyn

### Role
Lighthouse keeper of the Crossing; de facto neutral authority in the contested port; the woman who keeps the light burning.

### Appearance
Late thirties. Weathered, sunburned, calloused hands. Dresses in practical sailcloth. Hair bound back in sailor's queue. One leg below the knee is missing, replaced by a carved wooden prosthetic (shipwreck, five years ago). Moves with surprising agility despite the limitation. Eyes that have spent too many nights watching the darkness.

### Background
Born somewhere in the Island Reach—she doesn't discuss it. Sailor from childhood. Ship's navigator before the wreck that took her leg. Washed up at the Crossing while the plague raged and found herself the only person still willing to climb the lighthouse stairs. She's been there ever since.

### Personality
Taciturn, practical, unexpectedly fierce. Wyn says little and does what needs doing. She maintains the light because ships need it, feeds the refugees because people need it, stays neutral because someone has to. She has no interest in power, politics, or personal advancement—which paradoxically gives her significant moral authority.

She's haunted by something from before the Crossing. She never sleeps well. She drinks more than she should. She never talks about it.

### Goal
Keep the light burning. Everything else is secondary. She believes that as long as the beacon guides ships safely, civilization has a chance. If the lights go dark, the islands follow.

### Complication
She's alone. No staff, no support, no resources beyond what travelers leave in gratitude. The lighthouse is ancient and deteriorating. The oil supply is uncertain. Eventually something will fail that she can't fix, and the light will go dark. She's racing against entropy.

### Resources
- The lighthouse (invaluable to navigation)
- Moral authority (earned, not claimed)
- Detailed knowledge of the Crossing's treacherous waters
- The gratitude of everyone who's made safe passage
- Nothing else

---

## 5. Elder Kai-Rua of the Deep Current

### Role
Shio-Gatis elder; Speaker for the Spawning Grounds; liaison between the sea-folk and the surface world.

### Appearance
Gender unclear (Shio-Gatis don't gender the way surface-dwellers do). Age indeterminate—possibly seventy, possibly two hundred. Appears human-ish at low tide: scaled skin, webbed fingers, gills visible at neck. At high tide, transforms into something more aquatic. Voice has a liquid quality, like words rising through water.

### Background
Born in the Spawning Grounds to a lineage of current-readers—those who interpret the sea's messages. Trained for decades in the underwater caves, learning to hear what the deep has to say. Rose to Elder status through demonstrated wisdom, not political maneuvering.

### Personality
Alien to surface perspectives but genuinely trying to bridge the gap. Kai-Rua finds air-breathers confusing but fascinating. They (the Elder uses no gendered pronouns) approach problems from angles that land-dwellers don't consider, sometimes producing brilliant insights, sometimes complete misunderstandings.

They're deeply worried. Something is wrong in the sea. The currents carry wrong-feeling energy. The fish are fleeing depths they've always favored. The Spawning Grounds themselves are changing. Kai-Rua has never felt fear like this.

### Goal
Understand what's happening to the sea and stop it if possible. The Elder believes surface-dwellers may hold knowledge the sea-folk lack—or vice versa. Cooperation between peoples has never been the Shio-Gatis way, but desperate times demand adaptation.

### Complication
Kai-Rua's people don't trust surface-dwellers. Centuries of being used, exploited, and ignored have left deep wounds. The Elder is breaking tradition by reaching out; if the gamble fails, their authority—and possibly their life—is forfeit.

### Resources
- Knowledge of undersea geography no surface-dweller possesses
- The ability to communicate with other Atargatan peoples
- Sanctuary in the Spawning Grounds (unreachable by surface forces)
- Prophecy of the currents (unreliable but occasionally accurate)
- Desperation (sometimes the most powerful motivator)

# Part Five: Local Conditions

## The Reft Situation

### Prevalence
Moderate overall but extremely variable. Some islands were scoured clean by the Passing—their populations entirely converted or killed. Others were barely touched. The pattern appears random.

**Best Estimate:** ~3,000 Reft scattered across the archipelago, with heavy concentrations on specific islands and near-absence on others.

### Distribution

| Location | Reft Density | Notes |
|----------|--------------|-------|
| Portus Medius | Low | Aggressive clearance, patrols |
| Aoshima | Very Low | Quarantine worked; few infections |
| Freeport | Moderate | Pirates handle their own; varies by area |
| The Crossing | Moderate-High | Limited population to clear them |
| Sulfur Cay | Very Low | Volcano apparently deterred them |
| Pearl Shoals | Low | Water provides natural barrier |
| Uninhabited islands | Variable | Some empty, some swarming |

### Predominant Types

| Reft Type | Frequency | Behavior in Islands |
|-----------|-----------|---------------------|
| Drowned Reft (Depths) | High | Waterlogged, slow, emerge from surf |
| Storm Reft (Peaks) | Moderate | Aggressive during weather changes |
| Root Reft (Land) | Low | Territorial near forested areas |
| Bone Reft (Death) | Moderate | Gather near sites of mass death |
| Empty Reft (Abyss) | Rare but concerning | Memory loss reported near some islands |

### Island-Specific Dangers

**The Swimming Dead:** Drowned Reft can traverse water, unlike most types. They wash up on beaches, cling to ship hulls, emerge from seemingly safe harbors. Every coastal settlement has learned to check the waterline.

**Storm Callers:** Local superstition holds that Storm Reft activity precedes bad weather. This may be correlation rather than causation, but sailors watch for their telltale static-crackle.

**The Forgetting Isles:** Three islands in the western reaches have been declared off-limits. Those who land there return unable to remember anything about their visit—or sometimes unable to remember their own names. Empty Reft are suspected.

### Clearance Practices

- **Portus Medius:** Professional Reft-hunters, paid by the head
- **Aoshima:** Shrine-keepers perform purification rituals
- **Freeport:** Every adult armed; community defense
- **Elsewhere:** Whatever works—fire, blades, blessed water, pushing them off cliffs

---

## Travel

### By Sea

All significant travel in the Island Reach is maritime. The islands have no roads, no bridges (except within settlements), no overland routes.

**Vessel Types:**

| Type | Description | Common Use |
|------|-------------|------------|
| Outrigger canoe | Single-masted, 2-6 crew | Local island-hopping |
| Fishing boat | Small, sturdy, shallow draft | Daily fishing, short trips |
| Trading cog | Medium, cargo capacity | Inter-island commerce |
| Shiranui junk | Distinctive sails, good handling | Shiranui trade routes |
| War galley | Oared, fast, armed | Pirates, patrols, escort |
| Great caravel | Large, ocean-going | Long-distance trade |

**Navigation Challenges:**
- Submerged reefs throughout the archipelago
- Unpredictable currents near volcanic activity
- Seasonal storms (predictable but severe)
- Pirates (less predictable)
- The Dragon's Teeth and similar hazards

**Pilots:** Local knowledge is essential. Every major island has registered pilots who guide visiting vessels through dangerous waters. Their fees are high; so is the cost of not using them.

### By Land

Within islands, travel is on foot or by donkey on larger landmasses. Portus Medius has a few carts that manage the harbor district's relatively flat terrain.

### Communication

**The Beacon Chain:** Fast but limited to coded messages between equipped stations.

**Ship Courier:** Messages travel on whatever vessel is heading the right direction. Unreliable timing.

**Swimmer-Messengers:** For urgent communication, some communities employ strong swimmers who can traverse channels between nearby islands faster than waiting for boats.

**Atargatan Services:** The Shio-Gatis occasionally carry messages underwater, reaching places surface vessels cannot. Expensive and subject to their own priorities.

---

## Trade

### What Flows In

| Good | Source | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Grain | Empire (formerly) | Critical shortage since Passing |
| Manufactured goods | Empire, Tyrlóng | Metal tools, textiles, glassware |
| Silk | Shiranui | Luxury trade, reduced |
| Porcelain | Shiranui | Same |
| Alchemical supplies | Tyrlóng | Essential for various applications |
| Lumber | Various | Islands lack large trees |

### What Flows Out

| Good | Destination | Notes |
|------|-------------|-------|
| Pearls | Everywhere | Stored, waiting for market recovery |
| Sulfur | Tyrlóng primarily | Essential for their industry |
| Obsidian | Various | Blade-quality volcanic glass |
| Dried fish | Everywhere | Reliable food export |
| Navigational knowledge | Whoever pays | Pilot services, chart sales |

### Trade Routes

**The Imperial Route:** Portus Aureus → Portus Medius → points east. Functioning but reduced. Trade-Master Callista's primary concern.

**The Shiranui Route:** Aoshima → Shiranui homelands. Operational, controlled by Factor Yamamoto.

**The Tyrlóng Route:** Sulfur Cay → Tyrlóng (for sulfur). The most reliable current trade, maintained by Tyrlóng's Alchemists' Guild.

**The Shadow Routes:** Freeport → everywhere (for stolen goods). Flourishing, unfortunately.

### Who Controls It

No single authority. Trade-Master Callista taxes legitimate commerce through Portus Medius. Factor Yamamoto controls Shiranui trade through Aoshima. Captain Marek's pirates take their cut from everyone. The Tyrlóng factor on Sulfur Cay operates independently.

Coordination is minimal. Competition is constant. The system functions despite itself.

---

## Religion

### Official Status

The Solarian Church theoretically has jurisdiction, but its presence has always been weak in the islands. The last Church-appointed bishop died during the Passing; no replacement has been sent.

### What's Actually Practiced

**Atargatan traditions (Depths):** Strongest. The sea-peoples' faith is indigenous here. Offerings to the waters, respect for tides and currents, the Cycle theology. Every fisher knows the prayers.

**Kōrei worship (Shiranui):** Strong in Aoshima and among Shiranui communities. Bright spirits venerated, ancestors honored, purity maintained through ritual. Factor Yamamoto actively promotes it.

**Kasandran tradition (Life):** Popular among sailors (life-force before dangerous voyages) and in the pleasure quarters. The Fire Temple on Sulfur Cay is openly Kasandran.

**Ostaran tradition (Death):** The Chapel of the Drowned in Portus Medius serves those who've lost loved ones to the sea. The Passing intensified this practice—so many dead needed proper rites.

**Solarian Church (Light):** Vestigial. A single priest maintains the Imperial Chapel in Portus Medius. He performs services for whoever wants them and doesn't push.

**Revnan practices (Dark):** Quiet but present. The Mystery Structure appeals to those seeking hidden knowledge. The Whispering Caldera may have Revnan connections.

**Theosyn revival:** Growing interest in the "old gods." Odyssion (Wanderer) particularly popular among sailors. Nikaea (Unconquered) invoked before battles.

### The Reality

Religion in the Island Reach is pragmatic. People pray to whoever seems relevant to their immediate need. A sailor might ask Atargatan blessing for fair winds, make Kasandran offerings for good health, venerate Odyssion for safe return, and light a candle at the Imperial Chapel just in case. Theological consistency is for mainland scholars.

---

## The Scars

The Passing left physical wounds in reality throughout the islands. These "Scars" manifest differently here than on the mainland.

### The Silence of Coral-Rest

A small island that was home to a thriving village. During the Passing, every living thing on the island—humans, animals, plants—stopped making sound. They still lived for a time, moving silently, unable to communicate. Eventually they died, silently.

The silence persists. Nothing that enters the island can produce sound. Even the waves break without noise. Ships avoid it, but sometimes curious fools row ashore. Some return. None return unchanged.

### The Twisted Reef

A coral formation northwest of Portus Medius that has... rearranged itself. The reef now forms patterns—geometric shapes, perhaps writing in an unknown script. It changes configuration every few days, as if trying to spell something.

The fish that live in the Twisted Reef have changed too. They swim in formations now. They seem to be trying to communicate.

### The Boiling Shallows

A stretch of water between two islands that has become permanently heated. Not volcanic—the seabed is cold stone. The heat comes from... somewhere else. The water never cools below scalding.

Before the Passing, this was a productive fishing ground. Now it's a barrier. What's worse: things live in the boiling water now. Things that shouldn't be able to survive those temperatures. They're getting larger.

### The Walking Island

An island that wasn't there before the Passing. It appears on no pre-Passing charts. It occupies a location that was definitively open water.

The island moves. Not quickly—a few hundred feet per year—but demonstrably. It's moving... toward Portus Medius.

No one has managed to land on it. Boats that approach too closely are pushed away by currents that didn't exist moments before.

# Part Six: Adventure Hooks

## 1. The Lighthouse Murders

**Setup:** Keeper Wyn's message reaches the party: someone is killing Beacon-Keepers on the isolated towers. Three deaths in six months, all staged to look like accidents or Reft attacks, but Wyn knows her fellow keepers—they were too careful for accidents.

**Investigation:** The party must travel between tower stations, examining murder scenes, interviewing witnesses, and surviving on remote islands with minimal support.

**The Truth:** A Shiranui agent is eliminating the Beacon-Keepers to blind Imperial navigation in preparation for Shiranui expansion. Factor Yamamoto may or may not be aware—she's ruthless enough to order it, but also competent enough to know she'd be suspected.

**Complication:** If the party exposes the plot, they'll make enemies of Shiranui interests. If they don't, the beacon network collapses and navigation becomes deadly.

---

## 2. The Awakening Depths

**Setup:** Elder Kai-Rua approaches the party through an intermediary: something is wrong in the underwater caves of the Spawning Grounds. The sea-folk can't investigate—the volcanic vents are too hot for even their amphibian nature.

**Investigation:** The party must acquire (buy, borrow, or steal) water-breathing capabilities and descend into an underwater volcanic system. They'll encounter ancient Atargatan ruins, aggressive sea-life, and ultimately the source of the disturbance.

**The Truth:** The volcanic activity has cracked open a passage to something deeper—a structure that predates the Spawning Grounds, possibly predates the Hawthorne itself. Something in that structure is waking up.

**Complication:** Whatever's waking isn't malevolent—it's a Ti-Abzu elder who went dormant millennia ago and is now confused, frightened, and unimaginably powerful. Destroying it would be an atrocity. Calming it requires communication across a gulf of time and species.

---

## 3. The Pearl King's Legacy

**Setup:** The party is approached by a member of the diving families of Pearl Shoals: a rival family has discovered the location of the Pearl King's Cache—a legendary hoard hidden by the greatest pearl merchant in the islands' history, who died during a storm two centuries ago.

**The Quest:** Recover the Cache before the rival family can claim it. This requires navigating the sunken village beneath Pearl Shoals, solving the Pearl King's puzzle-locks, and escaping with the treasure.

**The Truth:** The Pearl King's Cache isn't pearls—it's information. Records of agreements between the islands' original inhabitants and... something else. Something that granted permission for pearl-harvesting in exchange for services never completed.

**Complication:** The rivals have the same information. Whoever opens the Cache will learn that the islands' prosperity was purchased with a promise that was never kept. The debt is still owed. And the creditor is waking up.

---

## 4. The Pirate's Redemption

**Setup:** Captain Marek approaches the party with a proposition: he wants to go legitimate, and he's willing to pay well for help. He needs the party to recover evidence of Imperial crimes that will give him leverage to negotiate amnesty.

**The Quest:** Travel to the Crossing, locate the Imperial archives hidden there during the evacuation, and recover specific documents proving corruption among Imperial naval officers.

**The Truth:** The documents are real, and the corruption was real. But what the officers were covering up wasn't simple graft—they were dealing with Freeport pirates, providing safe passage in exchange for shares of specific cargoes. Marek's own crew was involved. The evidence implicates him as much as the officials.

**Complication:** Marek may not have known what was in the documents, or he may have known exactly what he was asking the party to retrieve. Either way, the information gives the party enormous leverage—over Marek, over surviving officials, over anyone interested in the truth.

---

## 5. The Factor's Gambit

**Setup:** Factor Yamamoto approaches the party through intermediaries: she needs deniable agents for a sensitive operation. The job pays extremely well, and she promises Shiranui patronage for future endeavors.

**The Mission:** Travel to the Drowned Shrine, retrieve a specific artifact from its depths, and deliver it to Aoshima without anyone knowing what was recovered.

**The Truth:** The artifact is a piece of pre-Hawthorne technology—something that manipulates realm-fields in ways that shouldn't be possible. Yamamoto believes it will give Shiranui decisive advantage in the islands.

**Complication:** The artifact isn't dormant. It's been communicating with the things in the Drowned Shrine for millennia. Removing it will anger them—and awakening it will reveal that some technology shouldn't be used, regardless of the advantage it offers.
