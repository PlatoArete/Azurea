# The Golden Coast (Regio Aurea / Traeth Aur)
## Sub-Region Development Document

---

# Overview

The Golden Coast is the Empire's economic heart—a dense chain of trading ports stretching along the eastern seaboard, facing Shiranui across waters that have carried wealth for centuries. Before the Passing, this was the richest region of the Empire by far. Silk, spices, lacquerware, and strange eastern medicines flowed through these ports, making fortunes for merchant houses whose influence rivaled that of the great aristocratic families.

Now, with the Empire fractured and the Heartland in chaos, the Golden Coast has become something more than a trading region. It has become hope—perhaps the only hope—that civilization might recover. The eastern trade continues, diminished but persistent. Ships still sail to Shiranui. Goods still flow. And in a world where most roads lead only to death, the sea remains open.

**Imperial Name:** Regio Aurea
**Local Name:** Traeth Aur ("Golden Shore" in the old trade-tongue)
**Regional Capital:** Portus Aureus
**City Density:** High (approximately 1 major city per 50 miles along the coast)
**Climate:** Temperate coastal, mild winters, warm summers, frequent sea-fogs

# Part One: The Capital

## Portus Aureus — The Golden Port

### Names and Meanings

| Name | Language | Meaning |
|------|----------|---------|
| **Portus Aureus** | Imperial Latin | Golden Port |
| **Porth Aur** | Old Trade-Tongue | Golden Harbor |
| **Kinryō** | Shiranui Traders | The Gold Quay |
| **The Golden** | Common Speech | — |

The city has been called simply "The Golden" for so long that many forget it ever had a proper name. In the counting houses and consulates, in the warehouses and wine-shops, people speak of going "to the Golden" or "from the Golden" as if it were a destination beyond naming.

### Location and Geography

Portus Aureus occupies a natural crescent bay formed by two rocky headlands that reach into the eastern sea like embracing arms. The harbor is deep enough for the largest vessels, protected from storms by the headlands and by massive breakwaters constructed over centuries.

**The Harbor Geometry:**
- **The Outer Crescent:** Natural bay, two miles across at the mouth
- **The Inner Harbor:** Sheltered water behind the breakwaters
- **The Lighthouse Headland (Northern):** The Pharos Aureus stands here
- **The Fort Headland (Southern):** Naval fortress and shipyards
- **The Breakwater Chain:** Three massive stone structures creating calm water

The city rises from the waterfront in terraced levels, built on ancient foundations that predate the Empire. Some claim the original settlement was Goleuwyr; others say it was a Shiranui trading post; the truth is likely both, with layers of occupation stretching back beyond memory.

### Scale

| Metric | Pre-Passing | Post-Passing |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| **Population** | 150,000 | ~60,000 |
| **Active Berths** | 400+ | ~150 |
| **Trading Houses** | 200+ | ~60 (operating) |
| **Foreign Consulates** | 28 | 12 (staffed) |
| **Ships in Harbor (typical)** | 80-120 | 20-40 |

The population loss reflects both the plague itself and the massive exodus that followed. When the Passing came, those with means fled east toward Shiranui. Many died at sea. Many more were turned away from eastern ports. But tens of thousands simply vanished into the chaos, leaving behind empty mansions and abandoned warehouses.

### The Five Quarters

#### 1. The Harborfront (Ripa Aurea)

The heart of everything. A continuous line of stone quays, wooden docks, warehouses, counting houses, and commercial buildings stretching the full length of the inner harbor.

**Character:**
- Stone warehouses with iron-bound doors
- Counting houses with armed guards
- Cranes and pulleys for loading cargo
- The ever-present smell of salt, tar, and exotic spices
- Shouting in a dozen languages
- The cry of gulls and the creak of rigging

**Notable Features:**
- **The Golden Quay:** The oldest and finest berths, reserved for the great trading houses
- **The Weighing House:** Massive stone building where all goods are measured, taxed, and certified
- **The Exchange Floor:** Where prices are set and contracts signed
- **The Chain Houses:** Where the harbor chain is raised to close the port

**Post-Passing State:** Quieter than before, but still alive. The surviving trading houses have consolidated. Warehouses stand half-empty, but goods still flow. The Exchange still operates, though with fewer traders and more armed guards.

#### 2. The Foreign Quarter (Regio Peregrina)

Where the rest of the world lives in Portus Aureus. A maze of consulates, trading compounds, temples to foreign gods, and neighborhoods organized by nation of origin.

**Character:**
- Architecture from a dozen cultures crowded together
- Shiranui merchants in their enclosed compounds
- Tyrlóng factors in their brass-fitted offices
- The Goleuwyr trading house (the oldest building in the quarter)
- Incense and unfamiliar cooking smells
- Languages blending into an incomprehensible chorus

**Notable Features:**
- **Consulate Row:** Official diplomatic missions with their flags and guards
- **The Tower of Translation:** Neutral ground where multilingual negotiation occurs
- **The Temple Street:** Where foreign gods are worshipped (tolerated, barely, by the Church)
- **The Shiranui Compound:** Walled enclave where eastern merchants maintain their own customs

**Post-Passing State:** Half the consulates are closed or abandoned. The Shiranui compound has sealed its gates to outsiders. The Temple Street has become more openly active—the Church's authority has weakened. The Tower of Translation still operates, serving as neutral ground for increasingly desperate negotiations.

#### 3. The Merchant Heights (Collis Mercatorum)

Rising above the harbor, the terraced district where the great trading families built their mansions. Wealth expressed in stone, glass, and gardens with views of the ships that made the fortunes.

**Character:**
- Grand houses in mixed Imperial and eastern styles
- Private gardens with imported plants
- Paved streets (unlike most of the city)
- Guards at every gate
- The smell of money and the fear of losing it

**Notable Features:**
- **The Domus Aurata:** The Golden House, seat of the Aurelius family
- **The Silk Palace:** Built by the Serican merchants before they were expelled
- **The Counting Gardens:** Where the old merchant families meet to divide the trade
- **The Vista Terraces:** Public promenades with views of the harbor

**Post-Passing State:** Many mansions stand empty or have been seized by the Council of Captains. The surviving families have fortified their compounds. The Counting Gardens still host the meetings that matter—who controls what trade, which ships sail where, how to survive.

#### 4. The Commons (Vicus Populi)

Where the workers live. Sailors, dockworkers, warehouse laborers, servants, craftspeople, and all the others who make the port function. Dense, crowded, alive with the energy of people too busy surviving to despair.

**Character:**
- Narrow streets and crowded tenements
- The smell of fish, sweat, and cheap wine
- Sailors' taverns and dockworkers' inns
- Street markets selling everything
- The sound of arguments in multiple languages
- Life in its most unvarnished form

**Notable Features:**
- **The Rope Walk:** Where cordage is made and sailors gather
- **The Fish Market:** Fresh catch every morning (the one reliable food source)
- **The Widow's Quarter:** Where sailors' families wait for ships that may never return
- **The Shrine of Safe Return:** Small temple to Odyssion (officially "Saint Christopher")

**Post-Passing State:** The population has shifted dramatically. Many original residents died or fled; refugees from the Heartland have filled the gaps. The overcrowding is worse than before despite the lower total population—people cluster where there's safety and food.

#### 5. The Church District (Regio Sacra)

The Solarian presence in Portus Aureus. Less dominant than in the Heartland—commerce always came first here—but still substantial. Cathedral, monasteries, hospitals, and Church administration.

**Character:**
- White stone buildings in Solarian style
- Deliberate contrast with the chaos of the port
- Quiet streets and contemplative spaces
- The smell of incense and candle wax
- The sound of bells marking the hours

**Notable Features:**
- **The Cathedral of the Maritime Light:** Dedicated to Saint Aldric (the god Phaelon, though sailors don't care about the distinction)
- **The Lightkeeper's Monastery:** Monks who tend the Pharos and pray for safe voyages
- **The Hospital of the Healing Waters:** Run by Therapwyn's followers under Solarian cover
- **The Sending Chapel:** Where the dead are prepared for their journey

**Post-Passing State:** The Church's authority has weakened, but its practical functions remain essential. The Hospital is overwhelmed. The Sending Chapel works constantly. The Cathedral still holds services, though attendance is down and the prayers have an edge of desperation.

### Key Landmarks

#### The Pharos Aureus (The Golden Lighthouse)

The greatest lighthouse in the Empire, standing on the northern headland. Three hundred feet of stone and bronze, with a fire-chamber at the summit that has burned continuously for seven centuries.

**Construction:** Layers of history visible in the structure—Goleuwyr foundations, Imperial additions, Dragon-kin engineering for the fire-chamber.

**The Light:** Not merely fire. The chamber contains crystalline lenses that concentrate Light-field energy, creating a beam visible for fifty miles in clear weather.

**The Keepers:** A monastic order dedicated to maintaining the light. They've never let it go out—not during wars, plagues, or the Passing itself.

**Post-Passing State:** The light still burns. The Keepers still serve. But some nights the beam flickers in ways it never did before, and the Keepers won't speak of what they've seen in the fire.

#### The Tower of Translation

Neutral ground where speakers of different languages can negotiate without disadvantage. Built by agreement among all trading nations, staffed by linguists sworn to serve no single master.

**The Tower's Oath:** Translators must render meaning accurately, without favor or interpretation. Breaking this oath means death—and the oath is enforced by all parties equally.

**Architecture:** Circular building with a domed roof. The acoustics are precisely engineered so that whispers in one alcove cannot be heard in another.

**Post-Passing State:** More important than ever. The Tower has become a de facto court where disputes are settled, contracts enforced, and the new rules of trade negotiated.

#### The Weighing House

Every good entering or leaving the harbor is measured, taxed, and certified here. The scales and measures are maintained by a guild of weighers who serve the port itself, not any single authority.

**The Gilded Scales:** The ceremonial scale in the main hall, used for settling disputes about weights. Its accuracy is legendary; its verdicts are final.

**Post-Passing State:** The Council of Captains has claimed the tax revenue. The weighers continue their work, now serving whoever holds power rather than the distant Emperor.

#### The Shipyards (Navalia)

On the southern headland, beside the naval fortress. Where ships are built, repaired, and sometimes broken for salvage.

**Capacity:** Before the Passing, the yards could build a large merchant vessel in six months. Now they work at perhaps a quarter capacity, limited by materials and skilled labor.

**The Dry Docks:** Massive stone basins where ships can be lifted from the water for hull work. Imperial engineering at its finest.

**Post-Passing State:** Functioning, barely. The yards are critical infrastructure—whoever controls them controls the port's future. Currently held by the naval commander under the Council of Captains' authority.

### Who Rules

**The Council of Captains**

When the Empire collapsed, the great merchant families and ship captains formed a council to maintain order. What began as an emergency committee has become the de facto government.

**Composition:**
- **Five Great Captains:** The heads of the largest surviving trading houses
- **The Harbor Master:** Controls the port infrastructure
- **The Admiral:** Commands the naval forces
- **The Guild Speaker:** Represents the lesser merchants and craftspeople
- **The Foreign Consul:** Rotating position held by the senior foreign diplomat

**How It Functions:**
- Decisions require majority vote
- The Great Captains hold the real power
- The Admiral provides enforcement
- The Guild Speaker is usually ignored
- The Foreign Consul is consulted on matters affecting trade

**The Reality:**
The Council is a fragile compromise. The Great Captains compete for advantage. The Admiral has military force but needs the merchants' wealth. The Guild Speaker represents people with numbers but no individual power. The system works only because the alternative is worse.

### The Tension

The question that defines Portus Aureus: **Does the city's future lie with the Empire or with the East?**

**The Loyalist Position:**
- "The Empire will recover. Aurheim will reunite. We must maintain our connections to the Heartland."
- Represented by older families with Imperial titles and Heartland estates.
- Argues for maintaining Church authority and Imperial law.
- Fears that abandoning the Empire means becoming a Shiranui vassal.

**The Pragmatist Position:**
- "The Empire is dead. Our only hope is the eastern trade. We must strengthen ties with Shiranui."
- Represented by younger merchants and those with eastern connections.
- Argues for religious tolerance and commercial law over Imperial tradition.
- Fears that clinging to a dead Empire means missing the opportunity to survive.

**The Underlying Reality:**
Neither position is wrong. The Empire may recover; Shiranui may save them; neither may happen. The tension reflects genuine uncertainty about the future—and the decisions made now will shape what that future becomes.

# Part Two: Secondary Settlements

## 1. Portus Vitrum — The Glass Harbor

### Names

| Name | Language | Meaning |
|------|----------|---------|
| **Portus Vitrum** | Imperial Latin | Glass Port |
| **Porth Gwydr** | Old Trade-Tongue | Glass Harbor |
| **The Glassworks** | Common Speech | — |

### Type
Specialized manufacturing town and secondary port

### Population
- Pre-Passing: ~35,000
- Post-Passing: ~18,000

### Character

Thirty miles south of Portus Aureus, where a particular combination of sand, soda, and fire produces glass of exceptional quality. The town exists because of the glass—everything else is secondary.

The harbor is smaller than the Golden's but deep enough for medium vessels. Ships come specifically for glass: windows, bottles, lenses, mirrors, and the delicate colored glass that decorates wealthy homes throughout the Empire. The finest optical glass in the world is made here, ground into lenses by craftsmen whose skills are passed from parent to child.

The town rises in two parts: the waterfront with its docks and warehouses, and the heights above where the furnaces burn day and night. The glow of the glassworks is visible from sea, a constant orange pulse against the night sky. The air carries the smell of burning and the faint metallic tang of molten sand.

### Notable Feature: The Furnace Masters' Guild

The secret of fine glass-making is closely guarded. The Furnace Masters' Guild controls every aspect of production, from sand selection to final polish. Guild members are forbidden to leave the city without permission. Those who try to sell secrets to outsiders are executed—and this sentence has been carried out often enough that everyone believes it.

Post-Passing, the Guild has become even more protective. They know their skills are valuable. They've negotiated special status with the Council of Captains: favorable taxes, exemption from certain laws, their own militia. The price is continued production. As long as the glass flows, the Guild governs itself.

### Post-Passing State

The glassworks continue, though at reduced capacity. Skilled workers died in the plague like everyone else, and training replacements takes years. But glass remains valuable—more valuable than before, because other production centers were destroyed. Portus Vitrum may be producing less glass, but that glass is worth more than ever.

The town has become a haven for craftspeople fleeing chaos elsewhere. The Guild's strict order and effective militia make it safer than most places. Refugees with useful skills can find work; others are turned away at the gates.

---

## 2. Portus Salis — The Salt Harbor

### Names

| Name | Language | Meaning |
|------|----------|---------|
| **Portus Salis** | Imperial Latin | Salt Port |
| **Porth Halen** | Old Trade-Tongue | Salt Harbor |
| **The Saltings** | Common Speech | — |

### Type
Salt production center and fishing port

### Population
- Pre-Passing: ~25,000
- Post-Passing: ~15,000

### Character

Forty miles north of Portus Aureus, where shallow tidal flats have been converted to salt pans stretching for miles along the coast. The town itself is small compared to its territory—most of the "town" is actually the vast network of evaporation ponds, channels, and drying sheds that produce salt.

Salt is life. Salt preserves fish, cures meat, makes food edible. Before the Passing, Portus Salis supplied the entire eastern coast and exported to the Heartland. The salt trade was so reliable, so essential, that salt merchants were considered boringly dependable—until the world ended and suddenly dependability became the most valuable trait imaginable.

The town smells of brine, always. The air tastes of salt. Workers' skin cracks from constant exposure. But the work continues because it must. Without salt, the fishing fleets' catches rot. Without salt, the refugee populations starve.

### Notable Feature: The Salt Masters' Covenant

Long ago, the salt producers made a covenant: they would sell to all, favor none, and never use their control of essential resources as a weapon. This Covenant was enforced by tradition and the very real threat of unified action against any who broke it.

Post-Passing, the Covenant has been tested. Factions have offered enormous bribes for preferential access. The Council of Captains has pressured for "emergency measures." So far, the Salt Masters have held firm. They sell to all, favor none, and pretend not to see the chaos around them.

Some say this neutrality is admirable. Others say it's cowardice wrapped in principle. The Salt Masters say nothing—they simply continue making salt.

### Post-Passing State

Production is down but demand is up. The salt pans are partially flooded from storm damage that hasn't been fully repaired. Skilled workers are scarce. But salt remains salt, and everyone needs it.

The town has become a strange refuge for those who want to be left alone. The Salt Masters don't ask questions about anyone's past. They care only about the work. Criminals, heretics, and political refugees work alongside ordinary laborers in the salt pans, their former identities dissolved in brine.

## 3. Navalia Secunda — The Second Shipyard

### Names

| Name | Language | Meaning |
|------|----------|---------|
| **Navalia Secunda** | Imperial Latin | Second Shipyard |
| **Llongdy Arall** | Old Trade-Tongue | The Other Boatyard |
| **The Yards** | Common Speech | — |

### Type
Shipbuilding center and naval station

### Population
- Pre-Passing: ~20,000
- Post-Passing: ~12,000

### Character

Twenty-five miles south of Portus Aureus, built around a natural deep-water cove that provides perfect conditions for launching large vessels. The entire town exists to build ships—everything else is support for that purpose.

Unlike the cramped yards at Portus Aureus, Navalia Secunda has room to expand. The cove can accommodate multiple vessels under construction simultaneously. The surrounding forests (now carefully managed) provide timber. The nearby hills contain iron for fittings.

Before the Passing, this was where the Imperial Navy's eastern fleet was built and maintained. Now it serves whoever can pay—which mostly means the Council of Captains and the surviving trading houses.

### Notable Feature: The Launching Temple

Before any ship enters the water, it must be blessed at the Launching Temple. This Solarian ritual is actually a syncretized survival of older practices honoring Atargatis and Odyssion. The priests who perform the blessing know both the official prayers and the older invocations, switching between them depending on the captain's preference.

Ships launched without blessing are considered unlucky. Sailors refuse to crew them. The Launching Temple has become a strange nexus of religious practice where Solarian, Theosyn, and Atargatan traditions blend into something new.

### Post-Passing State

The yards are busier than ever. Ships were lost during the Passing—to storms, to accidents, to the plague killing their crews. Replacement vessels are desperately needed. The shipwrights work constantly, but they can't keep up with demand.

The town has become militarized. The Admiral—nominally under the Council of Captains' authority—maintains a strong garrison here. Control of the shipyards means control of the future fleet. Everyone understands this. The political maneuvering is constant but carefully hidden beneath a veneer of cooperative necessity.

---

## 4. Portus Piscis — The Fish Harbor

### Names

| Name | Language | Meaning |
|------|----------|---------|
| **Portus Piscis** | Imperial Latin | Fish Port |
| **Porth Pysgod** | Old Trade-Tongue | Fish Harbor |
| **The Fisheries** | Common Speech | — |

### Type
Fishing port and processing center

### Population
- Pre-Passing: ~18,000
- Post-Passing: ~14,000

### Character

Fifteen miles north of Portus Aureus, where the fishing grounds are richest and the currents bring silver shoals close to shore. This is where most of the Golden Coast's food comes from—not trade, not agriculture, but the endless harvesting of the sea.

The town is rough, practical, and entirely focused on the catch. The harbor fills with fishing boats at dawn, empties at dusk, fills again by midnight with the night-fishing fleet. The processing sheds work constantly, salting, smoking, and drying fish for preservation.

The smell is overwhelming to visitors. Residents stop noticing after a few days.

### Notable Feature: The Fishers' Compact

The fishing fleet operates under the Fishers' Compact—a traditional agreement that divides the waters, sets catch limits, and resolves disputes. Unlike the formal guilds of other trades, the Compact is enforced by consensus and social pressure. Violators aren't punished by law; they're simply excluded from the shared knowledge that makes successful fishing possible.

The Compact has held through the chaos because it has to. Overfish the waters, and everyone starves next year. The fishers understand this with a clarity that other survivors envy.

### Post-Passing State

The fishing continues. The sea doesn't care about plagues or empires. If anything, the reduced population means the catch per person is better than before.

But the fishers have noticed changes. Some species are appearing where they shouldn't. Others have vanished from traditional grounds. The water temperature is wrong—warmer in places, colder in others. Old fishers shake their heads and say the sea is "restless."

Some blame the Passing. Some blame the ivy that's said to be spreading through the undersea realms. The fishers don't know the cause, but they know something is changing.

# Part Three: Notable Sites

## 1. The Amber Wreck

### Type
Submerged treasure and sacred site

### Location
Three miles offshore from Portus Aureus, in sixty feet of water

### History

Two centuries ago, a great trading vessel called the *Aurum Orientale* sank in a sudden storm while carrying the largest cargo of eastern goods ever assembled—silk, spices, jade, and most notably, an enormous quantity of amber from beyond Shiranui. The cargo was worth more than most cities.

Recovery attempts were made, but the waters proved treacherous. Divers died. Ships sent to salvage were themselves wrecked. Eventually, the Abgal-Tako (cephalopod sages of the undersea) declared the site sacred to Atargatis and warned that further disturbance would anger the deep powers.

Whether due to supernatural protection or simply dangerous currents, the wreck has remained undisturbed since.

### Current State

The wreck is still there, visible on clear days as a dark shape on the sandy bottom. Fishers avoid the area—it's considered bad luck to drop nets near the Amber Wreck.

Recent rumors claim that something is moving among the wreckage. Divers who've approached (against all advice) report seeing figures in the water—not Reft, not drowned sailors, but something else. Something that watches and waits.

### The Hook

The amber alone would be worth a fortune—assuming anyone could recover it. But the warnings are clear, and those who've ignored them haven't returned. What guards the wreck? And what would happen if it were disturbed?

---

## 2. The Lighthouse Isle (Pharos Minor)

### Type
Abandoned fortress and secondary lighthouse

### Location
A rocky island fifteen miles off the coast, visible from Portus Aureus on clear days

### History

Built as a secondary navigation point and naval station, the Lighthouse Isle once maintained a garrison of two hundred soldiers and a staff of lighthouse keepers. Ships passing between the island and the mainland were within Imperial waters; ships passing outside were technically in open sea.

The island's lighthouse was smaller than the Pharos Aureus but still substantial—a hundred-foot tower with a conventional fire rather than the crystalline light of the main beacon.

### Current State

Abandoned during the Passing. The garrison was withdrawn to reinforce Portus Aureus; they never returned. The lighthouse fire went out for the first time in three centuries.

Now the island sits empty. Ships avoid it—the approaches are dangerous without a guiding light, and there are stories of vessels that anchored there and were never seen again.

Recent reports suggest the lighthouse fire has rekindled. Not consistently—it flickers, goes dark, returns. Who lit it? No one has gone to investigate.

### The Hook

Someone or something is on the island. The intermittent light could be survivors signaling for help. It could be a trap. It could be something worse. The Council of Captains wants to know what's happening but hasn't committed resources to find out.

---

## 3. The Drowned Village (Pentref Boddedig)

### Type
Tidal phenomenon and haunted site

### Location
Twenty miles south of Portus Aureus, accessible only at extreme low tides

### History

Generations ago, a coastal village was destroyed when the sea-cliffs collapsed and the land subsided. The village sank beneath the waves, drowning its entire population in a single catastrophic night.

At the lowest tides—only a few times each year—the ruins emerge. Stone foundations, broken walls, the remnants of a small temple. Shells and seaweed cover everything, but the shapes are unmistakably those of buildings. Of homes.

Local tradition holds that the village was punished for some transgression. Different tellers name different sins: blasphemy, betrayal of trust, refusing hospitality to travelers. The truth, if anyone ever knew it, has been forgotten.

### Current State

The ruins still emerge at the lowest tides. Local people avoid the site—the stories are too ingrained, the atmosphere too unsettling. Those who've walked among the ruins at low tide report feeling watched, hearing whispers beneath the sound of lapping water.

Since the Passing, something has changed. Visitors report that the ruins are more extensive than before—as if more of the village is emerging. And in certain lights, at certain angles, they see shapes moving through the water around the exposed stones.

### The Hook

The village is rising. Or something is pushing it up. The locals want to know why—and whether their coastal towns are in danger. Someone needs to investigate, preferably someone who won't panic at what they find.

---

## 4. The Garden of the Dawn

### Type
Hidden sacred grove and Goleuwyr sanctuary

### Location
In the hills behind Portus Aureus, location deliberately obscured

### History

Before the Empire, before the Church, the Goleuwyr maintained a sacred grove dedicated to the True Light—not Solwyn, not the Solarian God, but Bronwyn herself. The grove contained trees brought from the Light Realm before the Hawthorne sealed it, tended by elven priests for millennia.

When the Church rose to dominance, the grove was threatened. Rather than allow its destruction, the Goleuwyr hid it. Through some combination of natural concealment and Light-field magic, the grove became effectively invisible to those who didn't already know where to find it.

It has remained hidden ever since, known only to the elves and a handful of trusted humans.

### Current State

The grove still exists, tended by a small community of Goleuwyr who've remained loyal to the old ways. The trees—golden-leaved, silver-barked, unlike anything else in the world—still grow.

Since the Passing, the grove has become a refuge. Goleuwyr fleeing persecution elsewhere have made their way here, guided by old knowledge or simply following a pull they couldn't explain. The community has grown, and with it, the question of whether to remain hidden.

### The Hook

Someone is looking for the grove. Church inquisitors? Treasure hunters? Someone else? The Goleuwyr need help dealing with the searchers without revealing their sanctuary's location. The reward would be... complicated. What does elven trust look like? What secrets might they share?

# Part Four: Key Figures

## 1. Aurelia Caela — First Captain of the Council

### Role
Head of House Caelum, the wealthiest surviving trading family. De facto leader of the Council of Captains.

### Character

A woman in her fifties who rose to lead her family after her father and brothers died during the Passing. She survived not through luck but through the brutal pragmatism that has defined her tenure: recognizing when to cut losses, when to take risks, and when to sacrifice the few for the many.

She speaks softly, dresses simply, and controls more wealth than anyone else on the Golden Coast. Her trading ships still sail to Shiranui. Her warehouses hold goods that could feed armies or fund rebellions. She uses both capabilities with precision.

**Personality:**
- Calm in crisis—she's already lived through the worst thing she can imagine
- Calculating but not cruel—she takes no pleasure in hard decisions
- Patient—she can wait for opportunities that others miss
- Lonely—power is isolating, and she trusts no one completely

### Goal

To preserve the Golden Coast as an independent power base until she can determine whether the Empire will recover or collapse permanently. She's positioning to survive either outcome.

**Immediate objectives:**
- Maintain the eastern trade at all costs
- Keep the Council of Captains functioning despite its internal conflicts
- Build stockpiles of essential goods for leverage
- Prevent any single faction from gaining dominance

### Complication

Her eldest daughter, Lucia, has become enamored with a Shiranui merchant prince and wants to relocate permanently to the east. Aurelia sees this as both a personal loss and a strategic opportunity—a family alliance with Shiranui royalty would secure the eastern trade for generations. But it would also mean abandoning any hope of Imperial restoration, and that's a bridge she's not ready to burn.

---

## 2. Admiral Marcus Severinus — The Naval Commander

### Role
Commander of the Eastern Fleet (what remains of it). The only military force capable of projecting power along the Golden Coast.

### Character

A career naval officer who rose through merit in an institution where birth usually mattered more. He commanded the Imperial Navy's eastern squadron before the Passing and held his forces together when everything else collapsed.

He's fifty-two, weathered, and carries the weight of every man he's lost. His fleet once numbered forty warships; now he commands twelve that are fully operational, with another eight that could sail in emergency. Every vessel, every sailor, every weapon is precious beyond calculation.

**Personality:**
- Loyal to the Empire—or what he still believes the Empire should be
- Pragmatic—he serves the Council because there's no better option
- Protective of his men—he won't waste lives on foolish ventures
- Suspicious of civilians—they don't understand what it costs to keep them safe

### Goal

To maintain an effective naval force capable of protecting the Golden Coast from external threats while awaiting legitimate Imperial authority to restore order.

**Immediate objectives:**
- Protect shipping lanes from pirates and raiders
- Prevent any single faction from using naval power for political advantage
- Maintain shipyard production to rebuild the fleet
- Prepare for threats that haven't materialized yet—he's heard the reports from the undersea peoples

### Complication

Marcus served under the old regime. He followed orders that, in retrospect, were wrong—suppression of heresy that destroyed innocent communities, enforcement of laws that protected the powerful at the expense of the weak. He tells himself he was just following orders. He's not sure that excuse will be enough if the old order returns. He's not sure he wants it to.

---

## 3. Mei Ling-Feng — The Eastern Factor

### Role
Senior representative of the Shiranui trading consortium in Portus Aureus. The most influential foreign merchant on the Golden Coast.

### Character

A woman of indeterminate age (somewhere between forty and sixty, and not telling) who has lived in Portus Aureus for three decades. She speaks Imperial Latin flawlessly, knows the trading laws better than most local merchants, and maintains connections to both the Shiranui homeland and the various factions competing for control of the Golden Coast.

She survived the Passing by sealing the Shiranui compound and waiting it out. When the gates reopened, she emerged to find her position stronger than ever—she controlled the only reliable connection to eastern trade.

**Personality:**
- Gracious and formal—decades of diplomatic work have made politeness automatic
- Perceptive—she notices what people try to hide
- Cautious—she's seen too many promising situations turn catastrophic
- Torn—after thirty years, the Golden Coast feels like home, but Shiranui is where she'll retire

### Goal

To maintain and expand Shiranui's trading position on the Golden Coast while managing the delicate relationship between eastern and western powers.

**Immediate objectives:**
- Keep trade flowing in both directions
- Protect Shiranui citizens caught in the chaos
- Expand influence without provoking backlash
- Prepare exit routes for when the situation inevitably worsens

### Complication

Her orders from Shiranui have become increasingly aggressive. The consortium leadership sees opportunity in the Empire's collapse—a chance to establish dominance rather than partnership. Mei Ling-Feng knows that such overreach will trigger a backlash that destroys everything she's built. She's trying to implement her orders in ways that don't burn bridges, but the margin for maneuvering is narrowing.

# Part Five: Local Conditions

## The Reft Situation

The Golden Coast was hit hard by the Passing, but its Reft problem is different from the Heartland's.

**Prevalence:**
- Urban areas: Low to moderate (the plague spread quickly, but so did organized response)
- Coastal roads: Moderate (refugee columns left trails of victims)
- Inland hills: High in some areas (isolated communities died entirely)
- The sea: Unknown (there are reports of Reft in fishing grounds—Drowned Reft in the water)

**Predominant Types:**

| Type | Prevalence | Behavior |
|------|------------|----------|
| **Drowned Reft** | Common near water | Slow, relentless; drawn to the living; can emerge from any body of water |
| **Burning Reft** | Moderate in urban areas | Attracted to lights, especially the Pharos; sometimes gather staring at the beacon |
| **Shadow Reft** | Common in abandoned buildings | The empty warehouses are their territory now |

**Organized Response:**
The Council of Captains maintains patrols along the harbor and main roads. Individual trading houses employ guards for their compounds. The Admiral's forces can clear infested areas but won't commit to permanent occupation of non-essential territory.

**The Real Danger:**
The threat isn't masses of Reft—it's isolated encounters in places people thought were safe. A Drowned Reft in the fishing grounds. A Shadow Reft in a warehouse someone forgot to check. The constant vigilance required to survive is exhausting, and exhausted people make mistakes.

## Travel

**By Sea:**
The only reliable long-distance transportation. Ships still sail the coastal routes and across to Shiranui. The risks are pirates, storms, and whatever is changing in the deep waters—but those risks are manageable.

**By Road:**

| Route | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Coast Road (north-south) | Partially maintained | Patrols cover the stretch between main ports |
| Portus Aureus to Heartland | Dangerous | Bandits, Reft, and complete sections where maintenance has collapsed |
| Inland hill roads | Abandoned | Only traveled by the desperate or the armed |

**The Reality:**
Most people don't travel. They stay where they are, where they know the dangers. Those who must move go by sea if possible, or in large armed groups if not.

## Trade

The Golden Coast's economy has contracted but not collapsed.

**What Flows In:**

| Goods | Source | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Silk, spices, lacquerware | Shiranui | Volume down 60%, but still flowing |
| Manufactured goods | Tyrlóng | Limited—Tyrlóng has its own problems |
| Grain | Heartland | Intermittent—depends on which faction controls what |
| Weapons, tools | Local production | More valuable than gold |

**What Flows Out:**

| Goods | Destination | Notes |
|-------|-------------|-------|
| Glass | Everyone | Portus Vitrum's production is priceless |
| Salt | Everyone | Essential for preservation |
| Fish | Local consumption and some export | The sea provides |
| Information | Shiranui | The easterners pay well for intelligence about western chaos |

**Who Controls Trade:**
The Council of Captains sets overall policy, but individual trading houses control their own operations. The Weighing House taxes all goods. The guilds maintain quality standards. It's a complex system that works because everyone needs it to work.

## Religion

The Golden Coast was never as thoroughly Churched as the Heartland. Commerce always came first, and merchants who wanted to trade with non-believers couldn't afford excessive piety.

**Official Practice:**
The Solarian Church maintains its presence—the Cathedral, the monasteries, the formal rituals. The hierarchy's authority has weakened, but the institutions persist.

**Actual Practice:**

| Tradition | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Solarian | Official, declining | Attendance down; Church authority questioned |
| Odyssion worship | Open secret | Sailors never stopped praying to the Wanderer |
| Atargatan | Growing | The sea-faith spreads as the Church weakens |
| Theosyn revival | Beginning | The gods are remembered under saint-names |
| Shiranui traditions | Isolated | Practiced in the eastern compound |
| Light tradition (Goleuwyr) | Hidden | The Garden of the Dawn is known to few |

**The Post-Passing Shift:**
The Church failed to protect people. The old gods didn't prevent the catastrophe either, but at least they never promised to. There's a growing sense that the Solarian monopoly was always a lie, and now it's a lie without power to enforce itself.

## The Scars

The Passing left wounds in reality that haven't healed.

### The Silent Harbor

A section of the outer harbor where all sound ceases. Ships can sail through safely—if they don't panic when their voices vanish and their oars make no splash. The Silence extends about a hundred yards in diameter and hasn't moved since the Passing.

### The Burning Water

Near the southern headland, a patch of sea that glows at night with pale blue fire. The glow is cold, not hot, and fish avoid the area. The phenomenon appeared during the Passing and has persisted.

Some say the fire is beautiful. Others say it's wrong—that even looking at it too long makes them feel unreal, as if their own existence has become questionable.

### The Weeping Stones

In the Foreign Quarter, several buildings have developed a peculiar condition: their walls seep moisture that tastes of salt and something else—something that makes people who taste it weep uncontrollably for hours.

The affected buildings have been abandoned. The moisture continues.

# Part Six: Adventure Hooks

## 1. The Empty Ships

**Situation:**
A Shiranui trading vessel arrived at Portus Aureus with cargo intact but no crew aboard. The ship sailed itself into harbor, dropped anchor at the correct berth, and waited. When inspectors boarded, they found meals half-eaten, personal effects undisturbed, but no sign of what happened to thirty sailors.

This is the third empty ship in two months. The pattern suggests something in the eastern waters.

**The Question:**
What's happening on the trade route to Shiranui? Is something taking crews? Where do they go?

**Potential Complications:**
- The Shiranui consortium wants this investigated quietly—public panic would disrupt trade
- Survivors may exist, somewhere, and finding them might reveal the truth
- The phenomenon might be spreading toward the harbor itself

## 2. The Lighthouse Conspiracy

**Situation:**
Admiral Severinus has received intelligence suggesting that someone is planning to sabotage the Pharos Aureus. Destroying the lighthouse would cripple navigation, devastate trade, and make the harbor vulnerable to attack. But the intelligence doesn't identify who's planning this or when.

**The Question:**
Who benefits from destroying the lighthouse? Rivals who want to divert trade to their ports? Enemies who want to weaken the Golden Coast? Internal factions pursuing unknown agendas?

**Potential Complications:**
- The Lightkeeper monastery is secretive and doesn't welcome interference
- Multiple parties might want the lighthouse damaged for different reasons
- The investigators themselves might become suspects
- The "intelligence" might be disinformation designed to create chaos

## 3. The Inheritance Dispute

**Situation:**
A wealthy merchant died during the Passing, leaving behind a massive trading fortune and no clear heir. Three different claimants have emerged, each with documentation that may or may not be genuine. The dispute threatens to fracture one of the great trading houses.

The Council of Captains has asked for independent arbitration before the conflict becomes violent.

**The Question:**
Who is the legitimate heir? Or, if legitimacy is unclear, who should inherit for the good of the city?

**Potential Complications:**
- Each claimant has armed supporters and political backing
- The evidence may have been forged—but which evidence?
- The real heir might be someone none of the current claimants expect
- The merchant's fortune includes secrets that someone wants to stay buried

## 4. The Undersea Embassy

**Situation:**
The Abgal-Tako (cephalopod sages) have requested a meeting. This is unprecedented—the undersea peoples don't normally seek contact with surface-dwellers. They've asked to meet at the Amber Wreck, which they've declared neutral ground.

The Council of Captains wants representatives at this meeting but doesn't know what the Tako want.

**The Question:**
What do the undersea peoples want? And what are they willing to offer—or threaten—to get it?

**Potential Complications:**
- Human representatives must somehow survive at sixty feet underwater
- The Tako may have knowledge about what's wrong with the sea—but that knowledge might come with obligations
- Other factions might try to sabotage the meeting
- The Tako's goals might conflict with human interests in ways no one expects

## 5. The Sealed Compound

**Situation:**
A minor trading house sealed its compound during the Passing and never reopened. Everyone assumed the inhabitants died. But recently, smoke has been seen rising from the compound's chimneys. And neighbors report sounds at night—voices speaking in languages no one recognizes.

**The Question:**
What survived inside the sealed compound? Are they survivors who need help, or something else entirely?

**Potential Complications:**
- The compound's legal ownership is contested—whoever opens it might claim it
- What's inside might not want to be discovered
- The sounds might not be what they seem—auditory phenomena have appeared elsewhere since the Passing
- If there are survivors, they've been isolated for years—what have they become?
