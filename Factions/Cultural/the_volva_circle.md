# Overview

| Attribute           | Value                                                     |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Type**            | Religious/Cultural                                        |
| **Status**          | Active (Crisis Mode)                                      |
| **Scope**           | Ynys Wyllt and Wylltic Diaspora                           |
| **Primary Base**    | Scattered; strongest at sacred sites across the Wild Isle |
| **Symbol/Heraldry** | A staff wrapped in silver thread — the seer's tool        |

The Völva Circle is the loose network of seers, prophets, and spiritual practitioners who maintain Ynys Wyllt's religious traditions. The völva (singular: völva, plural: völur) are women (traditionally, though some men practice) who can see what others cannot: the future, the hidden, the spirits that walk alongside the living.

For centuries, the völur served as advisors, healers, arbiters, and intermediaries between the visible and invisible worlds. They held no political power but enormous influence—no chief made war without consulting his völva, no family married without blessing, no ship sailed without reading the signs.

Since the Passing, the Circle has fragmented. Some völur see the crisis as opportunity for traditional reassertion; others have embraced darker practices; still others have fled to the diaspora communities. What remains is trying to understand what's happening and guide their people through it.

# Part One: The Tradition

## What Völur Do

The völva tradition encompasses multiple practices:

| Practice           | Function                                     |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Seiðr**          | Trance-work, prophetic visions, fate-reading |
| **Galdr**          | Song-magic, chanting, verbal invocation      |
| **Rune-Craft**     | Reading and inscribing sacred symbols        |
| **Spirit-Speech**  | Communicating with landwights and ancestors  |
| **Herb-Knowledge** | Healing, poisons, mind-altering preparations |

**The Seiðr Trance:**
The core völva practice involves entering altered states to perceive what's hidden. In trance, the völva can:
- See possible futures (not certainties—fate weaves from many threads)
- Speak with the dead and with spirits
- Perceive distant events
- Influence minds and fortune (controversial; some consider this corruption)

## The Circle's Role

Traditionally, völur served their communities:

**Advisory:** Chiefs consulted völur before major decisions. The seer's word could prevent or justify war.

**Ritual:** The völva conducted ceremonies marking birth, death, marriage, and season-turning.

**Healing:** Physical and spiritual ailments both fell within völva expertise.

**Arbitration:** Disputes brought to a völva might be resolved through her spiritual insight rather than combat.

**Warning:** The völva's first duty was telling the truth, even when truth was unwelcome.

# Part Two: Structure & Leadership

## Organization

The Circle has minimal formal structure:

```
Elder Völur (Masters of tradition; decades of practice)
    ↓
Established Völur (Recognized practitioners)
    ↓
Apprentice Völur (Learning under masters)
```

**No Hierarchy:**
Völur don't command each other. The Circle is a network of relationship and mutual recognition, not a chain of authority. Elder völur have influence from experience, not from office.

**The Gatherings:**
Before the Passing, völur gathered at sacred sites during significant festivals to share visions, compare understanding, and maintain connection. These gatherings haven't happened since the crisis began.

## Key Figures

### Elder Sigrun Far-Seer

| Attribute | Value                                                  |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Title** | None; called "Elder" by respect                        |
| **Role**  | Most respected völva still practicing traditional ways |
| **Age**   | 71                                                     |

**Character:** Sigrun has practiced seiðr for fifty-five years—beginning her training as a child, recognized as full völva at seventeen, serving three generations of chiefs. She's seen everything the Wild Isle has experienced and predicted much of it.

She opposed the blood-magic turn from its first whispers. The old ways worked; the old gods answered when properly addressed; the temptation to grasp darker power was exactly the trap that always destroys those who take it. Her warnings were ignored.

Now she maintains a refuge at an ancient sacred site, gathering those völur who rejected the corruption. They're trying to understand what's happened, preserve what can be preserved, and prepare those who'll need to rebuild when the current madness burns out.

**Goal:** Preserve the true völva tradition through the current crisis so it can be restored when the bloodtide recedes.

**Complication:** Sigrun's visions have become unclear—something is interfering with seiðr itself. She can't see the future clearly, which terrifies her more than anything she's witnessed in half a century of practice.

### Ylva Blood-Eye

| Attribute | Value                             |
| --------- | --------------------------------- |
| **Title** | Voice of the Bleeding Dawn        |
| **Role**  | Leader of the blood-magic faction |
| **Age**   | 38                                |

**Character:** Ylva was a promising young völva when the Passing came—skilled, ambitious, frustrated by the elders' caution. When the old ways failed to prevent catastrophe, she concluded the old ways were insufficient. What was needed was power without limit.

She's found it. The Blood Field answers her calls. Her visions no longer require trance—they come unbidden, in streams of red. Her seiðr works when others' fails. Her followers grow because she delivers results when the traditionalists can only wring their hands.

She's not evil in her own understanding. She's practical. The world has changed; magic must change with it. Those who cling to inadequate traditions will die; those who adapt will survive. The blood-magic the old völur forbade works—that's all that matters.

**Goal:** Establish blood-magic völva practice as the new standard, replacing failed traditions.

**Complication:** Ylva is changing. The Blood Field takes as well as gives. Her followers notice that she sleeps less, eats less, bleeds when she shouldn't. She's becoming something other than human, and the transformation may not have end-point she can survive.

# Part Three: Goals & Tensions

## Primary Goal

**Survive and Guide**

The völur's fundamental purpose—guiding their people through crisis—hasn't changed. Their methods have fractured, creating competing visions of what guidance means.

## Faction Divisions

| Faction                      | Approach                                        | Status     |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| **Traditionalists** (Sigrun) | Preserve old ways; wait out the crisis          | Defensive  |
| **Blood-Workers** (Ylva)     | Embrace new power; whatever works               | Aggressive |
| **Diaspora**                 | Serve scattered communities; adapt to new homes | Growing    |
| **Withdrawn**                | Surrender the role; live as ordinary people     | Hidden     |

## Internal Tensions

### Old Ways vs. New Power
The fundamental split: are the old traditions sufficient, or does crisis require innovation? Both sides believe they're saving the völva legacy.

### Unity vs. Separation
Should the scattered völur reconnect, or has the Circle's time passed? Gathering risks conflict between factions.

### Responsibility vs. Survival
Völur traditionally serve their communities. What happens when serving means dying? When communities demand what völur can't provide?

# Part Four: Adventure Hooks

## 1. The Gathering Call

**Situation:** Elder Sigrun has sent a call for völur gathering—first since the Passing. She believes unity might restore the seiðr clarity that's been lost. But Ylva will certainly come, and confrontation seems inevitable.

**The Question:** Can the factions be reconciled? What happens when traditionalists face blood-workers? And what's actually interfering with völva visions?

## 2. The Apprentice's Choice

**Situation:** A young völva apprentice has fled Ynys Wyllt, carrying traditional knowledge she was charged to preserve. Blood-workers are hunting her; traditionalists are too weak to protect her; she needs outside help to survive long enough to find Elder Sigrun.

**The Question:** Can the apprentice be protected? What knowledge does she carry? And what does it mean that the blood-workers consider her dangerous enough to pursue across the sea?
