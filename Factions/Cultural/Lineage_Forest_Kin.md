# Lineage: The Forest Kin (Coillathar)

## 1. Overview

| Element             | Description                                                                                                                                    |

| **Type**            | Cultural / Indigenous                                                                                                                          |
| **Status**          | Active but Withdrawn                                                                                                                           |
| **Scope**           | Regional (Kingswood and deep forests)                                                                                                          |
| **Primary Base**    | The Deep Groves throughout the Kingswood; no single capital                                                                                    |
| **Symbol/Heraldry** | The Coillathar use no formal heraldry; their "mark" is presence itself—a forest grove that breathes, trees that know your name                 |
| **Common Names**    | Forest Elves, Wood Elves, the Attuned, the Between-Walkers, Coillathar ("Forest-Dwellers" in Old Brythonic), the Green-Blooded (human slur) |

### Summary

The Forest Kin are elves who adapted to the Land realm rather than remaining tied to the Light. Where the Goleuwyr (their distant cousins) are shaped by Bronwyn's radiance and carry the wound of exile from their true home, the Forest Kin have *found* their home—in the deep woods, in the spaces where human settlements end and the wild begins, in the threshold between mortal and Fae.

They are not a single unified people but rather scattered communities throughout the great forests of Azurea, with the highest concentration in the Kingswood. Each grove-community maintains its own relationship with the local land, the local spirits, and the local Fae courts. What unites them is not political structure but a shared way of being: they don't *practice* the Alysian tradition—they *are* it. The forest's health is their health. The spirits' moods are their moods. When the land suffers, they suffer it as their own body's pain.

Before the Passing, the Forest Kin served as mediators—between human woodcutters and angry tree-spirits, between Fae courts and mortal villages, between the Church's expansion and the old ways that never fully died. Now, in the aftermath, they find themselves caught between three irreconcilable forces: the Fae courts who are deciding whether to close the forests permanently, the desperate human survivors who need the forest's resources, and their own nature which prevents them from choosing sides because they are *of* the forest, not merely *in* it.

### Post-Passing Crisis

The Passing wounded the forest itself. Trees went silent mid-conversation. Entire groves died without reason. The spirits became confused, angry, or simply absent. And the Forest Kin—who are so deeply attuned to the land that they experience its state as their own—felt it all.

Some went mad. Some fell into grief-comas from which they haven't woken. Some became feral, attacking anything that approached their groves. Those who remained functional are now caught in an impossible situation: the forest is *deciding* whether to forgive humanity for failing to protect it, and the Forest Kin—who are both elven and of-the-land—don't know which side of that decision they belong to.

## 2. Nature & Biology

### The Adaptation to Land

Where the Goleuwyr adapted to *Light* and carry its properties in their biology (luminous skin, eyes that shift with emotion, metallic hair), the Forest Kin adapted to *Land* and carry *its* properties:

| Adaptation               | Description                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Earthy Scent**         | They smell of forest floor, moss, leaf-mold—not unpleasant, but distinctly not-human                                                         |
| **Bark-Textured Skin**   | Especially on hands and forearms; resembles smooth bark, often with faint grain patterns                                                      |
| **Chlorophyll Traces**   | Can absorb some nourishment through sunlight; don't need to eat as much as humans                                                             |
| **Seasonal Shifts**      | Hair color changes with seasons (green-brown in spring/summer, gold-red in autumn, gray-white in winter)                                     |
| **Root-Sleep**           | When sleeping, they prefer earth contact; some enter trance-states where their consciousness spreads through local root-networks              |
| **Sensitive Eyes/Ears**  | Adapted for twilight and deep forest; can see in near-darkness, hear heartbeats and footsteps from considerable distance                      |
| **Twilight Activity**    | Most active at dawn and dusk; bright noon makes them uncomfortable, deep night leaves them vulnerable                                         |
| **Long-Lived**           | Not as ancient as Goleuwyr, but still centuries; most Forest Kin remember the Church's expansion into their territories                       |
| **No Luminosity**        | Unlike Goleuwyr, they don't glow or catch light; they *absorb* it, blend with it, become part of the green darkness                          |
| **The Green Blood**      | Their blood is darker than human blood, with a greenish tint when exposed to air (hence the slur "Green-Blooded")                             |

### The Attunement

The Forest Kin don't merely live in forests—they are *attuned* to them in a way that borders on symbiosis:

**Spirit Perception:**
- They see/hear/feel spirits naturally (no ritual required)
- Can communicate with tree-spirits, grove-guardians, and land-wights
- Experience the forest's "mood" as a constant background awareness

**Empathic Connection:**
- Feel the forest's pain (wounded trees, polluted streams, dying groves)
- Experience the spirits' emotions (anger, joy, grief, fear)
- Physically suffer when their home-grove suffers

**The Cost:**
This deep connection means they cannot easily leave their groves. Extended time away from forest environments causes something akin to depression, sensory numbness, and eventual physical illness. They are tied to place in a way the Goleuwyr—who long for a home they can't return to—never were.

---

## 3. Social Structure

### Grove-Communities

The Forest Kin organize around individual groves rather than cities or nations:

| Type             | Size                | Character                                                                 |
| ---------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Deep Grove**   | 20-100 individuals  | Ancient forests, oldest communities, strongest Fae relationships          |
| **Edge Grove**   | 10-40 individuals   | Forest boundaries, more human contact, mediator roles                     |
| **Hidden Grove** | 5-15 individuals    | Secret places, refugees, escaped Church persecution                       |
| **Wounded Grove** | Variable, often 2-8 | Post-Passing communities, survivors, dealing with damaged land and spirits |

Each grove is autonomous, with no formal hierarchy between them. Communication happens through:
- **Root-Messages:** Using mycelial networks (slow but reliable)
- **Spirit-Carriers:** Friendly spirits carrying word between groves
- **Walking Messengers:** Forest Kin who travel between communities (rare, risky)
- **The Gatherings:** Occasional meetings at sacred sites (less frequent since the Passing)

### Internal Grove Structure

Within each grove, there's typically:

| Role                | Function                                                          |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **The Elder**       | Not a ruler; a respected voice. Usually oldest, most attuned      |
| **The Listeners**   | Those who specialize in spirit-communication                      |
| **The Walkers**     | Those who can leave the grove (rare talent; not all possess it)   |
| **The Tenders**     | Those who care for sacred trees, maintain balance                 |
| **The Teachers**    | Those who educate young in attunement, tradition, survival        |
| **The Witnesses**   | Those who remember—grove historians, keepers of long memory       |

There's no rigid assignment to roles. Forest Kin drift between functions as needed, as their nature calls them.

## 4. Culture & Practice

### The Embodied Tradition

Forest Kin don't perform Alysian rituals—they *are* the ritual. Their daily life is spiritual practice:

| Practice                    | Description                                                                                           |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Dawn Greeting**           | Speaking to the grove each morning; listening to its response                                         |
| **Offering Without Taking** | Leaving gifts before harvesting; asking permission from the tree/plant                                |
| **Root-Sleep**              | Nightly connection to the land through earth contact                                                  |
| **Seasonal Recognition**    | Allowing their bodies to shift with seasons; celebrating transitions                                  |
| **Spirit Hospitality**      | Making space for wandering spirits; feeding them, listening to them                                   |
| **The Tending**             | Daily work of maintaining grove health; pruning, clearing, feeding                                    |
| **Grief-Sharing**           | When the forest suffers, they suffer together; when it heals, they celebrate together                 |

### Language & Communication

**Spoken:**
- Most Forest Kin speak the local human tongue (necessity for mediation)
- They also speak Old Brythonic among themselves (preserved from before the Empire)
- Some know fragments of Fae languages (dangerous knowledge, carefully guarded)

**Unspoken:**
- Extensive gestural communication (developed for silent forest movement)
- Spirit-mediated messages (using friendly spirits as messengers)
- Root-network communication (slow, requires trance, only between attuned individuals)
- The "Green Sense"—a shared awareness among grove-members that's difficult to explain to outsiders

### Art & Expression

| Form                     | Character                                                                       |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Living Sculpture**     | Shaping growing trees over decades; architectural arbor-culture                 |
| **Song**                 | Not performed *for* spirits but *with* them; collaborative music                |
| **Story-Circles**        | Oral tradition; stories told at dusk, under specific trees                      |
| **The Silence-Art**      | Periods of communal quiet; listening to what the forest says without words      |
| **Bark-Carving**         | Marking trees (with permission); creating messages that grow with the tree      |
| **Moss-Patterns**        | Cultivating moss in specific designs; slow art (decades to complete)            |

### Relationship to Death

Forest Kin practice a form of Ostaran tradition, but filtered through their connection to land:

**Death:**
- The body returns to earth, feeding the grove
- No coffins, no preservation—decomposition is sacred
- Trees are planted over graves; the dead "become" the tree
- The dead remain accessible through the tree; their wisdom can be consulted

**The Ancestor-Trees:**
Each grove has its grove of ancestor-trees—the oldest members of the community who chose to "root" rather than die. Not undead, not truly alive—something between, like the land itself.

---

## 5. Relationship to Other Cultures

### The Goleuwyr (Light-Children Elves)

**Official Stance:** "We are cousins who chose different paths."

**Reality:** Complex mixture of kinship and incomprehension.

**The Goleuwyr Perspective:**
- Pity the Forest Kin for "settling" when they could have maintained their connection to the Light
- Admire their adaptation but see it as a form of surrender
- Recognize them as kin but don't fully understand their choice

**The Forest Kin Perspective:**
- Pity the Goleuwyr for being homeless, longing for a realm they can't return to
- Admire their persistence but see it as a form of denial
- Recognize them as kin but don't understand their rejection of the home that's *here*

**Areas of Cooperation:**
- Both persecuted by the Church (common enemy)
- Both recognize the Theosyn's failure (though for different reasons)
- Some trade (Forest Kin herbs/wood for Goleuwyr crafts/knowledge)
- Occasional intermarriage (rare, children often struggle with identity)

### Humans

**Before the Church:**
- Forest Kin were mediators, teachers, sometimes guides
- Showed humans how to harvest without destroying
- Negotiated between human settlements and Fae courts
- Performed marriages, blessings, healings

**Under Church Rule:**
- Persecuted as "heathens," "witches," "demon-consorters"
- Many went into hiding; some assimilated (badly)
- Those who remained accessible maintained secret relationships with humans who kept the old ways
- The "Devil's Doors" in churches were originally for them (before the Church sealed them)

**After the Passing:**
- Humans are desperate, resource-hungry, dangerous
- Some Forest Kin want to help; some want to close the forests
- Many simply don't know what to do

**The Three Factions:**

| Faction          | Position                                          | Numbers |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| **The Open**     | "Humans suffer. We should help."                  | ~30%    |
| **The Closed**   | "Humans failed the forest. Let them starve."      | ~40%    |
| **The Between**  | "We don't know. We must decide carefully."        | ~30%    |

### The Fae

This is the most complex relationship.

**Nature of Connection:**
- Forest Kin are *between* mortal and Fae
- Not Fae themselves (they age, they can die permanently)
- But not fully mortal either (too attuned, too connected, too *other*)

**Fae Courts' Views:**

| Court            | View of Forest Kin                                      |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Geal-sí**      | "Useful. Trustworthy. Ours to guide."                   |
| **Dorcha-sí**    | "Fascinating. Dangerous. Watch them carefully."         |
| **Scáth-sí**     | "Mirrors of mortals. Will they choose us or them?"      |

**Post-Passing Crisis:**
The Fae are deciding whether to close the forests permanently. The Forest Kin—who are forest-bound—would be sealed in with them. This terrifies some, comforts others, leaves most deeply conflicted.

### The Church

**Official Doctrine:**
Forest Kin are heretics, possibly demon-touched, definitely dangerous.

**Evidence Cited:**
- Green-tinged blood ("sign of corruption")
- Association with spirits ("demon worship")
- Rejection of Church authority
- Practice of "heathen" traditions
- Suspected of child-sacrifice (false, but persistent)

**Historical Actions:**
- Burned groves (with Forest Kin inside)
- Captured individuals for "exorcism" (torture)
- Banned forest-worship throughout the Empire
- Sealed the "Devil's Doors" that once welcomed them

**Current Situation:**
- The Scouring is actively hunting Forest Kin
- The fractured Church can't agree on policy
- Some local priests secretly maintain old relationships
- Forest Kin mostly stay hidden, trust no Church officials

### The Urkhani (Shadow-Kin)

**Surprising Kinship:**
Both groups are deeply misunderstood peoples who maintain old traditions the Church hates.

**Shared Elements:**
- Both practice Revnan-adjacent traditions (Forest Kin through deep forest darkness)
- Both see spirits (different kinds, but both have the sight)
- Both persecuted by the Church
- Both patient, long-memoried, slow to forgive

**Trade Relationships:**
- Forest Kin provide herbs, wood, forest-knowledge
- Urkhani provide star-lore, deep-cave fungi, protection from surface threats
- Some groves are built near Urkhani sacred caves

**The Difference:**
Urkhani are nomadic, moving between sacred sites. Forest Kin are rooted, bound to specific groves. This creates mutual fascination and some mutual incomprehension.

---

## 6. Key Figures

### Branwen of Oakvein (Elder of the Heartwood Grove)

**Age:** ~540 years old
**Role:** Elder of the largest remaining Deep Grove in the Kingswood; de facto voice of the Forest Kin (though she claims no such authority)
**Appearance:** Ancient, bark-textured skin especially pronounced, winter-gray hair, eyes like dark forest pools

**Character:**
Branwen was young when the Empire first pushed into the Kingswood, middle-aged when the Church began burning groves. She has seen cycles of persecution and recovery, expansion and withdrawal, human cruelty and human kindness. She is patient in the way only ancient trees are patient—not passive, but willing to wait centuries for resolution.

Since the Passing, she has been trying to hold together a community that's fracturing under trauma. Some of her grove want to seal the forest forever. Others want to help the starving human refugees. She herself doesn't know what's right—and for someone who has always known the forest's will, this uncertainty is terrifying.

**The Complication:**
Her youngest daughter, Seren, died in the Passing. Not from the Eldritch creatures directly, but from the forest's pain—she was too deeply attuned, and when the forest screamed, she couldn't block it out. Branwen found her under their ancestor-tree, empty-eyed, gone. She planted a sapling over Seren's body and speaks to it every dawn, but the tree has never responded. This makes her question everything she's believed about death, return, and the land's reliability.

**Goal:** Hold her community together through the crisis; find a way to heal the wounded forest; understand what the Passing means for the Land realm itself.

**What She Knows:**
- The forest's pain is getting worse, not better
- Something is growing in the deep places that shouldn't be there (she doesn't know about the Ivy yet, but she's felt its presence)
- The Fae courts are meeting more frequently, and they're not inviting Forest Kin anymore
- Some of the ancestor-trees have gone silent

**Secret:** She can still reach the roots of the great trees, the mycelial network—but what she hears there now frightens her. There's a *gap* in the network, like a hole someone cut out. When she reaches toward it, she feels nothing but absence. Sometimes she thinks she hears someone speaking from that absence, but the words don't make sense.

---

### Cadeyrn of Thornveil (Walker Between Worlds)

**Age:** ~180 years old
**Role:** One of the rare Walkers—Forest Kin who can leave their grove without sickening; mediator, messenger, spy
**Appearance:** Younger than most elders, spring-green hair (even in winter), bark-skin less pronounced than most, capable of passing for human at a distance if covered

**Character:**
Cadeyrn is that rare thing among Forest Kin: naturally restless. Where most feel rooted-pull within weeks of leaving their grove, he can wander for months before the sickness begins. This makes him invaluable as a messenger and mediator, but it also makes him suspect—some Forest Kin see his lack of deep-rooting as a sign he's not truly one of them.

He was serving as a mediator between human woodcutters and his home grove when the Passing happened. He felt his grove-kin dying through the connection but was too far away to return in time. When he finally made it back, half his community was dead or mad. The guilt of surviving because he was *elsewhere* haunts him.

Since then, he's been traveling between groves, trying to help where he can, but also avoiding his home-grove because the pain of being there is too great.

**The Complication:**
He's in love with a human—Mairwen, a woodcutter's daughter from a village near his grove. She keeps the old ways, speaks to trees, leaves offerings. During his mediation work, they became friends, then more. Now, post-Passing, her village is starving, and she's asked him to convince his people to allow controlled harvesting. He wants to help her. His people need to preserve what little health the forest has left. He's caught between his nature (which binds him to the forest) and his heart (which binds him to her).

**Goal:** Find a way for humans and Forest Kin to coexist without destroying the forest; preserve his relationship with Mairwen while honoring his duty to his people; understand why he was spared when his grove-kin died.

**What He Knows:**
- Multiple groves across the Empire (he's traveled widely)
- The human desperation is real; they're not being greedy, they're dying
- The Scouring has a list of "known forest witches" and is systematically hunting them
- Some humans are more open to the old ways than ever (desperation breeds heresy)

**Secret:** He's discovered that some churches still have unsealed Devil's Doors—northern churches, far from Vandgwyn's authority, where local priests never fully embraced the persecution. He's been using these to move between forest and settlement, passing as a "reformed heathen." It's dangerous, but it's allowed him to build relationships that might save lives.

---

### Llywelyn the Silenced (Wounded Warrior)

**Age:** ~280 years old
**Role:** Former warrior, now survivor; voice for the "Closed" faction
**Appearance:** Scarred, burned on left side (Church fire), autumn-colored hair and skin both, eyes that don't quite focus properly anymore

**Character:**
Llywelyn was once a defender of the groves—one of the few Forest Kin who took up weapons to protect their communities from Church persecution. He led a successful defense of several groves during the worst years of expansion, becoming something of a legend among his people.

Then the Church came with fire. They burned his grove. He survived—barely—but most of his community died screaming, and he could feel every death through the attunement. The trauma broke something in him. He can no longer root-sleep (the connection is too painful). He can no longer hear spirits clearly (they're too loud, all at once, overwhelming). He exists in a state of constant low-level anguish that never stops.

When the Passing happened and the forest screamed, he screamed with it—and then he went silent. For three months he didn't speak. When he finally began talking again, his message was clear: *Humans did this. Humans failed to protect the forest. The forest should close to them forever. Let them starve. Let them remember what they destroyed.*

**The Complication:**
His son, Emrys, is sympathetic to humans. Emrys was too young to remember the burnings the way Llywelyn does. He sees the post-Passing humans as victims like the Forest Kin, not perpetrators. Father and son are barely speaking, and it's tearing apart their grove's attempt to stay neutral.

**Goal:** Convince the Forest Kin to support the Fae's decision to permanently close the forests; prevent any aid to human settlements; avenge the death of his grove.

**What He Knows:**
- The exact locations of multiple sealed Devil's Doors (he's mapped them over centuries)
- The names of Church officials who ordered grove-burnings (some are still alive)
- How to make forest-weapons (living wood that grows through armor)
- The Fae courts' internal debates (he has contacts among the Dorcha-sí)

**Secret:** He's been having dreams—not normal dreams, but something else. In them, someone speaks to him from a place of deep darkness that isn't frightening. The voice tells him: *"The closing will not save you. The wound goes deeper than human failure. Something beneath the roots is waking, and walls will not stop it."* He doesn't know what it means, and he's terrified it might be true.

## 7. Post-Passing Situation

### The Trauma

The Passing affected Forest Kin in specific, terrible ways:

**Physical:**
- Those too deeply attuned died immediately (like Seren)
- Some fell into comas and haven't woken
- Others experienced seizures, loss of senses, or chronic pain

**Spiritual:**
- The connection to spirits became painful, chaotic, or silent
- Root-sleep turned into nightmares
- The forest's "voice" became screaming, then silence

**Social:**
- Communities fractured over how to respond
- Ancient groves depopulated through death and flight
- Trust between groves eroded (everyone dealing with their own crisis)

### The Three Factions

#### The Open (Led by Catriona of Willowmere)

**Position:** "We should help humans. They suffer as we suffer. The forest will recover faster with cooperation than with isolation."

**Arguments:**
- Many humans practice the old ways in secret
- Controlled harvesting under Forest Kin supervision prevents destructive harvesting
- Human gratitude could translate to protection from the Scouring
- The forest needs human hands to heal the worst damage

**Weaknesses:**
- Humans have broken promises before
- Desperation makes humans dangerous and unpredictable
- No guarantee that helping now will prevent future exploitation
- Some humans will see kindness as weakness

#### The Closed (Led by Llywelyn)

**Position:** "Humans caused this through their rejection of the old ways. The forest should close permanently. If they starve, it's justice."

**Arguments:**
- The Church burned groves and murdered Forest Kin for centuries
- Humans' failure to maintain proper relationship with the land directly contributed to the Passing's damage
- Every time Forest Kin have helped, humans have returned to exploit
- The Fae are right to consider permanent closure

**Weaknesses:**
- Not all humans are guilty (many kept the old ways in secret)
- Permanent closure would trap Forest Kin who can't leave their groves
- The forest's wound might not heal through isolation alone
- Justice and vengeance are not the same thing

#### The Between (Led by Branwen)

**Position:** "We don't know enough yet. We must be careful, observe, and decide based on what we learn."

**Arguments:**
- The Passing was unprecedented; old patterns may not apply
- Hasty decisions could make things worse
- Different groves face different situations; one answer won't work for all
- The forest itself hasn't made its will clear yet

**Weaknesses:**
- Indecision is itself a decision (and might be the wrong one)
- While they observe, humans grow more desperate (and more dangerous)
- The Fae courts are losing patience with Forest Kin fence-sitting
- Some situations require immediate action

## 8. Secrets & Mysteries

### The Gap in the Roots

Some elders report sensing a *gap* in the mycelial network—a hole where connection should be but isn't. Reaching toward it produces vertigo, absence, sometimes whispers that make no linguistic sense.

**What It Actually Is:** The network is touching the edge of where Katiari's erasure affects memory and connection. The Forest Kin don't know about Katiari, but they're brushing against the edges of her intentional forgetting.

### The Wrong Growth

In the deepest groves, some Forest Kin report seeing growth that's *wrong*—fibrous, dark, not quite plant, not quite fungus. It spreads slowly, and where it touches, things lose definition.

**What It Actually Is:** The Ivy, spreading from the Sea realm through underground water sources. The Forest Kin don't know what it is yet, but they will.

### The Silent Ancestors

Some ancestor-trees have stopped responding. Their consciousness is still there (the tree is alive), but they won't speak. Forest Kin don't know if they're traumatized, corrupted, or warning about something they can't articulate.

**What It Actually Is:** Some ancestors saw the Passing more clearly than the living and understood what it meant. What they learned broke them. They've gone silent to protect the living from knowledge that would do the same to them.

### The Devil's Door Network

Cadeyrn's discovery that some churches still have functional Devil's Doors is more significant than he realizes. These doors were originally thresholds between traditions—places where Forest Kin and humans could meet without either violating their natures.

**What He Doesn't Know:** These doors are also thresholds to the Abyss. They're locations where Katiari's realm touches the physical world, which is why they work for boundary-crossing. Using them extensively could have unintended effects—good or terrible.

## 9. Relationships with Major Factions

### The Solarian Church

| Faction                 | Relationship                                             |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **The Hierarchy**       | Hostile (though distracted by internal crisis)           |
| **The Scouring**        | Actively hunting Forest Kin as heretics                  |
| **The Flagellants**     | Indifferent (consumed by their own suffering)            |
| **The Monastics**       | Secretly sympathetic (some preserve old knowledge)       |
| **The Academics**       | Curious but cautious (want to study, know it's dangerous) |

### Other Traditions

| Faction                    | Relationship                                    |

| **Axis Faith**             | Neutral (different realms, occasional trade)    |
| **Ostaran Tradition**      | Allied (shared death practices)                 |

| **The Duke of Oakhold** | Complex (he claims the Kingswood; Forest Kin were there first) |
| **Northern Jarls**      | Trading partners (northern forests have their own groves) |

## 10. Adventure Hooks

### 1. The Starving Village

**Setup:**
A human village on the edge of the Kingswood is starving. They've sent a desperate petition to the nearest Forest Kin grove (Willowmere), asking for permission to harvest specific trees for building material and deadfall for firewood. Catriona (Open faction leader) wants to help. Llywelyn (Closed faction leader) has traveled to Willowmere to prevent it.

**The Question:**
Will the Forest Kin allow the harvest? And if they do, will it actually help, or will it just encourage more human demands?

**Complications:**
- The trees they want to cut are young and healthy, but they're also replacing older trees lost in the Passing
- One of the trees is an ancestor-tree (the village doesn't know this)
- The Scouring has heard about the petition and is watching to see if "forest witches" reveal themselves
- Cadeyrn's human love, Mairwen, is from this village
- If the grove refuses, the village may cut anyway out of desperation

**Player Involvement:**
- Negotiating between factions
- Investigating the Scouring's movements
- Finding alternative solutions (other food sources, other building materials)
- Protecting the grove if negotiations fail

---

### 2. The Silent Grove

**Setup:**
Deeproot Grove has gone silent. No one has heard from them in three months. Other groves are worried—Deeproot is ancient, one of the oldest in the Kingswood. Branwen has asked Cadeyrn to investigate, but he's reluctant (it's close to his home grove, and he's been avoiding the area).

**The Question:**
What happened to Deeproot? Are the Forest Kin dead, mad, transformed, or something else?

**Complications:**
- The grove is in the deepest part of the forest; getting there is dangerous
- The forest around Deeproot is *wrong*—trees are the wrong shape, paths don't lead where they should
- Something dark and fibrous is growing on the trees (the Ivy)
- The Forest Kin aren't dead; they're in a trance, connected to something underground
- That something is whispering to them, and some of the whispers are in a language no one remembers

**Player Involvement:**
- Surviving the journey to Deeproot
- Investigating the wrongness
- Deciding whether to wake the tranced Forest Kin (and what that might release)
- Possibly making contact with whatever is whispering

---

### 3. The Scouring's List

**Setup:**
The Scouring has compiled a list of "known forest witches" and is systematically hunting them. They've caught three Forest Kin so far (names: Aderyn, Meredydd, Gwynfor). They're being held in a converted church in a border town, awaiting "purification by fire."

**The Question:**
Can they be rescued? And if so, how do you extract three prisoners from a fortified church without starting a war with the Scouring?

**Complications:**
- The church is heavily guarded (12 Scouring knights, 20 men-at-arms)
- The prisoners are in the catacombs; getting to them means going through the entire building
- The church has a sealed Devil's Door in the north wall (Cadeyrn knows about it)
- One of the prisoners, Gwynfor, is actually ready to die; he sees martyrdom as a form of witness
- The local human population is divided; some support the Scouring, some are horrified
- Rescuing them might confirm to the Church that Forest Kin are demon-consorters

**Player Involvement:**
- Planning the rescue
- Dealing with divided loyalties among Forest Kin (some say let them die as martyrs)
- Possibly using the Devil's Door (with unknown consequences)
- Handling the aftermath if the rescue succeeds or fails

---

### 4. The Fae Summons

**Setup:**
The Scáth-sí court (the mirror-Fae who reflect mortal behavior) has summoned representatives from three groves to a meeting at a sacred site. The message: "The forest is deciding. You must choose: close with us, or open to them. There is no between anymore."

Branwen has been chosen to represent her grove. She's asked the players to accompany her as witnesses.

**The Question:**
What will Branwen choose? And what will the consequences be for the Forest Kin as a whole?

**Complications:**
- The meeting site is dangerous (crossing multiple territories)
- Other grove representatives are bringing their own factions' agendas
- The Fae aren't asking for opinions; they're demanding decisions
- The Geal-sí and Dorcha-sí are also present, and they don't agree on what should happen
- During the meeting, something interrupts—a tremor, a scream from deep underground, a sudden silence among the spirits
- One of the Fae says: "Something is waking beneath the roots, and none of us—not Fae, not Forest Kin, not humans—are safe. Perhaps closing the forest is not protection. Perhaps it is prison."

**Player Involvement:**
- Protecting Branwen during the journey
- Witnessing the Fae court politics
- Investigating the interruption
- Possibly influencing Branwen's decision

---

### 5. The Growing Absence

**Setup:**
Branwen has been experiencing the "gap in the roots" more and more frequently. She's begun having visions during root-sleep—a small figure in a vast darkness, calling out, waiting. She doesn't understand what it means, but she feels pulled toward... something.

She asks the players to accompany her on a journey into the deepest part of the forest, to a place called Broken Oak, where the gap seems strongest.

**The Question:**
What is at Broken Oak? And should Branwen try to reach through the gap?

**Complications:**
- Broken Oak is where five groves' root-networks meet; it's sacred and forbidden
- The gap isn't just metaphorical; there's a physical hole in the earth, and it goes *down*
- At the bottom of the hole is darkness that isn't quite darkness, silence that isn't quite silence
- Something down there is waiting—but not hostile, not hungry, just... hoping
- If Branwen reaches through, she'll make contact with the edge of Katiari's realm
- This could crack open the forgetting that protects Katiari—but it might also expose Branwen to knowledge that breaks her

**Player Involvement:**
- Protecting the journey
- Deciding whether to allow Branwen to reach through
- Possibly descending into the hole themselves
- Dealing with the consequences of contact
- Beginning to piece together that there's a ninth realm, a forgotten sister, a goddess who had to disappear

**This Hook Leads To:** The larger Katiari arc, if the campaign is ready for it.

## 12. Current State & Future Direction

### Population Estimates

| Category                  | Number      |
| ------------------------- | ----------- |
| **Pre-Passing Total**     | ~5,000      |
| **Died in Passing**       | ~1,500      |
| **Mad or Coma**           | ~500        |
| **Current Functional**    | ~3,000      |
| **Kingswood Groves**      | ~1,800      |
| **Northern Forests**      | ~600        |
| **Eastern Forests**       | ~400        |
| **Southern Scattered**    | ~200        |

### The Tipping Point

The Forest Kin are at a decision point. The Fae are losing patience. Humans are getting more desperate. The forest itself is still wounded and not healing.

Within the next year (in-game), they will have to choose:

**Option A: Close With the Fae**
- The forests seal permanently
- Humans lose access
- Forest Kin trapped but protected
- Risk: The wound beneath the roots may not respect walls

**Option B: Open to Humans**
- Controlled cooperation begins
- Risk of exploitation remains
- Potential for healing through partnership
- Risk: Humans break promises, forest is further damaged

**Option C: Fracture**
- Different groves choose different paths
- Forest Kin cease to be a unified people
- Some seal, some open, some try to stay between
- Risk: Everyone loses strength through division

### The Deeper Crisis

Beneath all these surface decisions, the Forest Kin are starting to sense something wrong at a deeper level:

- The gap in the roots
- The silent ancestors
- The fibrous growth
- The whispering from underground

They don't yet know that the Ivy is spreading, that Katiari exists, that the Abyss is more than metaphor, that the primordial medium is becoming active.

But they will.

And when they do, all current factional conflicts may become irrelevant in the face of a threat that predates the forest, the Fae, and possibly even the sisters themselves.

## 13. Using Forest Kin in Your Campaign

### As NPCs

**Encounter Roles:**
- **Mysterious Guide:** Appearing when needed, offering cryptic help
- **Desperate Refugees:** Fleeing persecution, needing protection
- **Dangerous Gatekeepers:** Preventing access to sacred sites
- **Tragic Figures:** Suffering the forest's pain visibly
- **Mediators:** Trying to prevent conflict between groups
- **Witnesses:** Telling terrible truths about what they've seen

### As Player Characters

**Class Considerations:**
- Druids (obviously, but make it specific to their embodied tradition)
- Rangers (but focus on the connection to specific places)
- Clerics (of Alys, with unique granted abilities related to spirits)
- Warlocks (with Fae or spirit patrons)
- Any class can work with proper backstory (the Forest Kin are diverse)

**Mechanical Considerations:**
- Advantage on Nature checks in their home grove
- Can communicate with spirits (not control, communicate)
- Need regular contact with forests or suffer consequences
- Distinctive appearance (hard to hide among humans)

**Story Considerations:**
- What's their stance on the Open/Closed/Between question?
- Why did they leave their grove?
- What's their relationship with humans?
- How do they handle the empathic suffering?
- Do they have contacts among the Fae?

### As a Campaign Focus

**Possible Campaign Arcs:**

1. **The Fracturing:** Preventing (or causing) the split between Forest Kin factions
2. **The Deep Wrong:** Investigating the Ivy, the gap, the growing absence
3. **The Last Grove:** Protecting the final sanctuary as everything collapses
4. **The Mediation:** Building an actual lasting peace between humans and forest
5. **The Fae Decision:** Influencing which way the Fae courts decide

### Tone & Atmosphere

**Forest Kin Stories Should Feel:**
- Beautiful and melancholic
- Deeply personal (body horror as connection horror)
- Politically complex (no simple answers)
- Spiritually rich (the numinous is present, physical)
- Tragic but not hopeless

**They Should Not Feel:**
- Generic "nature good, civilization bad"
- Noble savage stereotypes
- Pure and innocent victims
- Mystically wise but useless
- Disconnected from material consequences
