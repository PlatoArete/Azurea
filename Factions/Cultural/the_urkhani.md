The Urkhani—the "Shadow-kin"—are the dark counterpart to the Goleuwyr: beings shaped by or connected to Revna, the Dark Sister, dwelling in shadow rather than light. Where elves are associated with forests and beauty, the Urkhani are associated with darkness, secrets, and the depths.

The Church's position on the Urkhani is simpler than on elves: they are demons, or demon-touched, or at minimum minions of evil. No theological ambiguity. No middle ground. The Urkhani are enemies to be destroyed on sight.

This has made them expert at not being seen. They live in the shadows of human cities—literally in the case of those dwelling in sewers, catacombs, and forgotten underground spaces. They've survived for centuries through secrecy, through networks of protection, through understanding the darkness that humans fear and they call home.

# Part One: Nature & Culture

## What the Urkhani Are

The Urkhani are not demons. They are their own people, connected to the Dark-field as the Goleuwyr are connected to Light. Church doctrine about their nature is propaganda built on fear.

**Physical Nature:**
- Variable appearance (some nearly human, some distinctly other)
- Dark-adapted vision (comfortable in low light; uncomfortable in brightness)
- Moderate lifespans (150-200 years typical)
- Physical resilience, particularly to cold

**Spiritual Nature:**
- Souls connected to depth, shadow, and hidden things
- Natural affinity for darkness-related magics
- Perception of what lies beneath surfaces
- Sensitivity to secrets and hidden truths

**The Diversity:**
Unlike the relatively uniform Goleuwyr, the Urkhani show significant variation. Some appear nearly human with slightly unusual features. Others have marked physical differences—unusual skin tones, eyes adapted for darkness, or features suggesting depth-dwelling adaptation. This diversity reflects their scattered origins and mixed heritage.

## Cultural Values

| Value          | Expression                                                       |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Secrecy**    | Information is power; protect sources; reveal carefully          |
| **Pragmatism** | Survival requires flexibility; ideology serves life, not reverse |
| **Community**  | Deep bonds within network; fierce protection of members          |
| **Knowledge**  | Understanding is survival; ignorance kills                       |
| **Patience**   | Centuries of persecution have taught long-term thinking          |

## The Hidden Cities

Urkhani communities exist beneath and within human cities—populations the surface dwellers don't know exist:

**Under-Aurheim:** Largest Urkhani settlement, in the forgotten depths beneath the capital. Ancient catacombs, abandoned basements, and natural caverns have been connected into a shadow-city of perhaps a thousand souls.

**Lexium's Depths:** The great library sits atop older structures. The Urkhani who live in those structures have access to knowledge the Library doesn't know it possesses.

**The Mortuum Warrens:** The death-devoted city has extensive underworld connections. The Urkhani there have developed particular expertise in the spaces between living and dead.

# Part Two: Structure & Leadership

## Organization

Urkhani society is organized through Networks—overlapping groups defined by function, location, and relationship rather than strict hierarchy.

```
The Shadow Council (Representatives of major Networks)
    ↓
Network Keepers (Leaders of significant Networks)
    ↓
Cell Leaders (Managers of operational groups)
    ↓
Members (Participating individuals)
```

**Networks Include:**
- **The Guides:** Maintain safe passages and hidden routes
- **The Providers:** Secure food, supplies, and resources
- **The Watchers:** Gather intelligence on surface threats
- **The Defenders:** Protect communities from discovery or attack
- **The Traders:** Maintain economic relationships with trusted humans

## Current Leadership

| Position            | Name                   | Notes                    |
| ------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Shadow Speaker      | Grandmother Nightshade | Voice of Shadow Council  |
| Keeper of Guides    | Silvio Darkpath        | Master of hidden ways    |
| Keeper of Watchers  | Ash-Eyes               | Intelligence coordinator |
| Keeper of Defenders | The Stone              | Military capability      |
| Keeper of Traders   | Marcus Half-Born       | Human-Urkhani liaison    |

## Key Figures

### Grandmother Nightshade

| Attribute | Value                                 |
| --------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Title** | Shadow Speaker of the United Networks |
| **Role**  | Senior authority; crisis coordinator  |
| **Age**   | 186                                   |

**Character:** Grandmother Nightshade has led the Under-Aurheim community for forty years—through periods of relative peace and through the catastrophe of the Passing. She's watched her people adapt to changing circumstances, mourn their losses, and continue surviving despite everything.

She's earned the "Grandmother" title through decades of caring for her community's needs—mediating disputes, allocating resources, making the hard decisions that keep everyone alive. She's not actually anyone's grandmother; she's never had children. She's everyone's grandmother in the ways that matter.

She believes the Passing offers opportunity. The surface world is in chaos. Authorities that hunted her people are distracted. Old systems are breaking down. For the first time in her lifetime, emergence might be possible. But she's also old enough to remember previous moments of hope that ended in blood.

**Goal:** To position the Urkhani so they can emerge successfully when the moment is right—or survive if it isn't.

**Complication:** Nightshade is dying of a wasting illness she's hidden from most of her people. She has perhaps two years. She needs to arrange succession before she's too weak to ensure it goes smoothly. The obvious successors have significant flaws.

### Ash-Eyes (Keeper of Watchers)

| Attribute | Value                                        |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Title** | Keeper of the Watchers Network               |
| **Role**  | Intelligence coordinator; surface specialist |
| **Age**   | 67                                           |

**Character:** Ash-Eyes earned her name from eyes that appear colorless in certain lights—a marked Urkhani trait that makes surface movement difficult. Nevertheless, she's spent decades learning the surface world, recruiting human informants, and building the intelligence network that keeps her people safe.

She's paranoid—but for the Urkhani, paranoia is survival trait. She sees threats everywhere because threats exist everywhere. Her caution has prevented disasters. It's also prevented opportunities.

She's deeply concerned about the Passing's implications. Her watchers report that the surface world is destabilizing faster than expected. Various factions are competing for power. The Church is fracturing. Old enemies are weakening. These could be opportunities—or they could be traps. She needs more information before recommending action.

**Goal:** To understand the changing surface world well enough to advise the Shadow Council on whether and how to emerge.

**Complication:** One of Ash-Eyes' most trusted informants—a human merchant who's passed intelligence for twenty years—has been arrested by the Inquisition. He knows things that could compromise Urkhani security. She's trying to determine whether to attempt rescue, assassination, or evacuation.

### Marcus Half-Born

| Attribute | Value                                     |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Title** | Keeper of the Traders Network             |
| **Role**  | Commerce coordinator; human-world liaison |
| **Age**   | 34                                        |

**Character:** Marcus is half Urkhani—his mother was shadow-kin, his father a human merchant who didn't know his lover's true nature until after Marcus was born. His mother raised him in the human world, teaching him to pass as fully human while maintaining secret connection to Urkhani society.

He lives between worlds in a way few others can. He understands how humans think because he is partially human. He understands Urkhani needs because he is partially that too. This makes him invaluable as liaison—and perpetually suspect to both communities.

He believes emergence is inevitable and should be prepared for rather than feared. Humans aren't uniformly hostile; many would accept the Urkhani if given reason to. The Passing has created opportunities for groups willing to help with reconstruction. The shadow-kin could offer skills the surface world desperately needs.

**Goal:** To prove that Urkhani-human cooperation is possible, preparing the path for eventual emergence.

**Complication:** Marcus has discovered something disturbing: his human father is still alive, now a mid-ranking officer in the Regency Council's administrative apparatus. They've never met. His father doesn't know he exists. Making contact could provide unprecedented access—or catastrophic exposure.

# Part Three: Goals & Tensions

## Primary Goal

**Secure Survival**

Like the Goleuwyr, the Urkhani's primary goal is survival. But their approach differs: where elves hide in nature, the Urkhani hide in civilization. Their survival depends on remaining useful enough to justify the risk of discovery while secret enough to avoid persecution.

## Secondary Goals

- **Expansion:** Safely grow hidden communities as opportunities permit
- **Integration:** Develop economic and social ties with surface world
- **Preparation:** Ready the community for eventual emergence or continued hiding
- **Knowledge:** Understand the changing world to navigate it safely

## Internal Tensions

### Hiding vs. Emergence
The fundamental debate mirrors the Goleuwyr's: continue hiding, or risk revelation? Among the Urkhani, the debate is more practical than philosophical—they already interact extensively with humans, just secretly.

### Pure vs. Mixed
Some Urkhani consider those of mixed heritage (like Marcus) to be less authentic, potential security risks, or bridges toward a better future. This tension affects community cohesion.

### Isolation vs. Alliance
Should the Networks ally with other persecuted groups (Goleuwyr, folk practitioners, reformists) or maintain independence? Alliances provide strength but also exposure.

## External Tensions

### Church Persecution
"Demon-kin" face immediate execution if discovered. No trial, no appeal, no mercy. This is the fundamental constraint on all Urkhani activity.

### Human Prejudice
Even non-Church humans often fear the Urkhani based on stories and propaganda. Overcoming this conditioning would require sustained effort.

### Surface Chaos
The Passing has destabilized everything. Chaos provides cover but also danger. New power structures may be worse than old ones.

# Part Four: Assets & Resources

## Material Resources

| Resource               | Status     | Notes                                                   |
| ---------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Hidden Spaces**      | Extensive  | Underground networks in multiple cities                 |
| **Shadow Economy**     | Functional | Trade, services, and production the surface doesn't see |
| **Accumulated Wealth** | Moderate   | Generations of careful accumulation                     |
| **Specialized Crafts** | Valuable   | Skills surface dwellers often lack                      |

## Magical Resources

**Dark-Field Affinity:** Natural connection to Revna's realm-field enables:
- Shadow manipulation (concealment, travel through darkness)
- Truth perception (seeing through deception, finding hidden things)
- Emotional sensing (perceiving feelings and intentions)
- Dream walking (communication and influence through dreams)

**Knowledge Resources:**
- Underground geography of major cities
- Secrets discovered through generations of watching
- Lost history the surface has forgotten
- Connections to other hidden peoples

## Network Resources

**Information Networks:** The Watchers maintain intelligence on surface developments, factions, and individuals.

**Trade Networks:** Economic relationships with surface merchants, fences, and connected individuals.

**Escape Networks:** Routes for moving people safely between cities, into hiding, or out of danger zones.

# Part Five: Relationships

| Faction               | Relationship        | Notes                                       |
| --------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Church Hierarchy**  | Lethal              | "Demon spawn" to be destroyed               |
| **The Scouring**      | Lethal              | Extra-enthusiastic about shadow-kin targets |
| **Inquisition**       | Hostile             | Actively hunts Urkhani                      |
| **Reformists**        | Potentially Useful  | Some might advocate tolerance               |
| **Goleuwyr**          | Theoretical Kinship | Little actual contact                       |
| **Criminal Networks** | Complex             | Sometimes overlap; sometimes compete        |
| **Urban Poor**        | Neighbors           | Share spaces; sometimes help each other     |

# Part Six: Adventure Hooks

## 1. The Arrested Informant

**Situation:** Ash-Eyes' trusted informant, a merchant named Cornelius, has been arrested by the Inquisition. He knows the location of Under-Aurheim's entrances, the identities of Network leaders, and decades of secrets. The Inquisition is questioning him. Time is running out.

**The Question:** Can Cornelius be rescued before he breaks? Should he be silenced instead? Or should the Urkhani evacuate before his information is acted upon?

**Complications:**
- Cornelius has been loyal for twenty years; he deserves rescue if possible
- The Inquisition prison is probably not impregnable, but definitely dangerous
- Evacuation would mean abandoning generations of built infrastructure
- Cornelius may have already talked—the threat may already be known
- The rescue attempt itself might expose more than his confession would

## 2. The Father's Shadow

**Situation:** Marcus Half-Born wants to make contact with his human father—now a Regency Council administrator—to build an inside connection for future Urkhani emergence. The Shadow Council is divided on whether this is brilliant opportunity or catastrophic risk.

**The Question:** Should Marcus approach his father? How? What happens if it works—or doesn't?

**Complications:**
- Father may react with fear, rejection, or betrayal
- Success would provide unprecedented access to power
- Failure could expose the entire Traders Network
- Marcus's own feelings may compromise his judgment
- Other factions might benefit from learning Marcus's secret

## 3. The Alliance Question

**Situation:** The Goleuwyr have made tentative contact—specifically, Aerinnel Starwatcher has found Urkhani communities while wandering between elven enclaves. He proposes alliance between the persecuted peoples. The Shadow Council must decide: accept, reject, or negotiate?

**The Question:** Would alliance with the Goleuwyr strengthen or endanger the Urkhani? What would partnership look like? And do the two peoples actually have compatible goals?

**Complications:**
- Elves and shadow-kin have different histories and approaches
- Some on both sides don't trust the other
- Combined visibility might attract combined attention
- Complementary skills could benefit both peoples
- The Church would view alliance as confirmation of heretical conspiracy

## 4. The Emergence Test

**Situation:** A surface community devastated by Reft is appealing for help that conventional authorities can't provide. The Urkhani could help—they have knowledge and skills that might save lives. But helping means revealing themselves. Grandmother Nightshade proposes this as a test: reveal to one community, see what happens.

**The Question:** Is this community the right test case? Can they be trusted? And what happens after—success or failure?

**Complications:**
- Revelation can't be undone
- The community may accept help then betray helpers
- Success could encourage broader emergence before conditions are right
- Failure would confirm that hiding remains necessary
- Other Urkhani may not accept Nightshade's authority to risk everyone's safety
