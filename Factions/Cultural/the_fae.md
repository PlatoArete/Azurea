# The Fae: First Peoples of the Land

## Overview

| Element             | Details                                                                                   |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Type**            | Cultural / Spiritual                                                                      |
| **Status**          | Active (Deliberating)                                                                     |
| **Scope**           | Regional (Primarily Kingswood and wild places, but present wherever land remembers)       |
| **Primary Base**    | The Deep Kingswood (Coillrí); no single capital                                           |
| **Symbol/Heraldry** | Varies by court—spirals, thorns, mirrors, oak leaves                                      |
| **Population**      | Unknown (Fae do not count themselves, and mortals cannot count them)                      |

**Summary:**

The Fae are the indigenous peoples of the Land—born from Alys's tree before the mortal races arrived, before the God-Giant War, before the Hawthorne separated the realms. They are not spirits or gods but *people*, as real as elves or humans, though operating according to older rules. They remember when the land was young, when the sister-trees first took root, and when mortals were refugees fleeing divine war.

The Fae are not a unified nation but a complex web of courts, kindreds, and individual powers bound by ancient customs, territorial claims, and the deep magic of place. They are fascinated by humanity—these "Children of the Forgotten Sister"—and serve variously as tricksters, teachers, protectors, and threats depending on which Fae you encounter and how you approach them.

Since the Passing, the Kingswood has *closed*. Paths that worked for centuries now lead in circles. The Fae are deciding what to do about humanity's failure to protect what they were given, and about their own role in a world that has changed beyond recognition.

---

## The Three Dispositions

The Fae are not inherently good or evil—they are *responsive*. Their nature reflects mortal behavior, the health of the land, and their own ancient purposes. They are traditionally divided into three broad dispositions:

### The Geal-sí (Bright Ones) / Kōrei (Bright Spirits)

**Character:** Favorably disposed toward mortals who show respect, honor the land, and keep their promises.

**Associated With:**
- Dawn, spring, growth, healing
- The Green Man, the Oak King, the Summer Court
- Blessings, bargains kept, protection of children
- Light without malice, warmth without cruelty

**How to Identify Them:**
- Appear in pleasant forms (beautiful, welcoming, radiant)
- Offer gifts before asking prices
- Keep their word precisely
- Help those who help the land

**Current Mood (Post-Passing):**
*Disappointed but not vengeful.* They gave humanity stewardship of certain places, and humanity failed to protect them. Some Geal-sí have withdrawn their blessings—springs that once healed now just flow, trees that once gave shelter now just stand. Others are waiting to see if humans will learn.

**Key Question:** *Can mortals be trusted again, or should we only aid those who prove themselves worthy?*

---

### The Dorcha-sí (Dark Ones) / Anrei (Dark Spirits)

**Character:** Indifferent to hostile toward mortals. They are dangerous, unconcerned with mortal welfare, and perfectly comfortable killing those who trespass or disrespect.

**Associated With:**
- Dusk, autumn, decay, testing
- The Cailleach, the Wild Hunt, the Winter Court
- Trials, prices exacted, children stolen
- Dark without evil, cold without mercy

**How to Identify Them:**
- Appear in unsettling forms (ancient, strange, beautiful in terrible ways)
- Demand prices before offering gifts
- Keep their word *exactly* (which may not be what you thought you bargained for)
- Punish those who harm the land

**Current Mood (Post-Passing):**
*Vindicated and angry.* They always said mortals couldn't be trusted. The Passing proved them right. Some Dorcha-sí are actively hostile now—strangers who enter the wrong groves don't leave. Others are simply indifferent, letting humans struggle without interference.

**Key Question:** *Why should we care what happens to mortals who destroyed what we gave them?*

---

### The Scáth-sí (Mirror Ones) / Kagami-rei (Mirror Spirits)

**Character:** Reflective. They mirror mortal behavior—kindness begets kindness, cruelty begets cruelty, respect begets respect. They are the most mysterious because they have no fixed nature.

**Associated With:**
- Twilight, equinoxes, thresholds, balance
- The Púca, the Selkies, the shapeshifters
- Transformation, revelation, truth shown in reflection
- Neither light nor dark but what you bring to them

**How to Identify Them:**
- Appear differently to different people
- Offer tests disguised as gifts, gifts disguised as tests
- Keep their word in ways that teach lessons
- Become what mortals expect them to be

**Current Mood (Post-Passing):**
*Watching and waiting.* The Scáth-sí are observing how mortals respond to catastrophe. Some communities have turned to mutual aid and respect for the land—the Scáth-sí respond with subtle blessings. Others have turned cruel or exploitative—the Scáth-sí respond with trickery and danger. They are mapping the new reality.

**Key Question:** *What will mortals become in the aftermath, and should we mirror their becoming?*

---

## The Types of Fae

### The Tall Ones (Sidhe / Noble Fae)

**Nature:** The aristocracy of Faerie. Ancient, powerful, terrifyingly beautiful. A Sidhe's presence is unmistakable—the air changes, light bends, mortals feel small.

**Power Level:** Can curse bloodlines, bless kingdoms, reshape landscapes. Entering a compact with a Sidhe is binding for generations.

**Examples:**
- **The Oak King** — Rules the summer woods (Geal-sí)
- **The Cailleach** — The hag of winter and stone (Dorcha-sí)
- **The Púca King** — Lord of shapeshifters (Scáth-sí)

**Where Found:** Deep places, ancient groves, sites of power. They do not come to mortals lightly.

**Post-Passing Status:** The Tall Ones are *deliberating*. They meet in councils mortals cannot attend, in places mortals cannot reach. What they decide will shape the next age.

---

### The Small Folk (Brownies, Pixies, etc.)

**Nature:** Household helpers, garden tenders, minor tricksters. They live alongside mortals more than any other Fae type.

**Power Level:** Limited but persistent. A brownie can't curse you, but it can make your life miserable. Or delightful.

**Examples:**
- **Brownies** — Household helpers who work for cream and bread
- **Pixies** — Garden tenders who lead travelers astray (or home)
- **Leprechauns** — Craftspeople who hide their work and their gold
- **Domovoi** — Hearth spirits who protect families (or torment them)

**Where Found:** Farms, cottages, gardens, anywhere mortals have made homes that still respect the land.

**Post-Passing Status:** Many have left. Households that once had brownies now don't. The Small Folk are the most sensitive to mortal behavior—disrespect drives them away, but genuine need can sometimes call them back.

**The Exception:** Some brownies have stayed with families they've tended for generations, even if those families have faltered. Loyalty runs deep.

---

### The Wild Ones (Green Men, Tree-Folk, etc.)

**Nature:** Spirits of the deep wild. They are the forest, the hill, the river given form. Speaking with them is speaking with the land itself.

**Power Level:** Variable. A Green Man can be a minor wood-spirit or a force of nature that can level a town. Age matters.

**Examples:**
- **Green Men** — Vegetation spirits, faces in bark
- **Dryads** — Tree-spirits bound to specific groves
- **Naiads** — Water-spirits of springs and streams
- **Leshy** — Forest guardians who protect (or hunt) intruders

**Where Found:** Wilderness. The places mortals haven't settled, or where mortals once settled and the land has reclaimed.

**Post-Passing Status:** The Wild Ones felt the Passing most directly. The eldritch creatures *hurt the land*. Places the Wild Ones tended are scarred, silent, wrong. Some Wild Ones have become hostile to everyone—even other Fae. Others are trying to heal what was wounded.

**The Scarred Groves:** Certain forests are *different* now. The Wild Ones there are changed. They speak in fragments, move erratically, or have gone entirely silent. Even the Fae don't know what to do.

---

### The Shapeshifters (Selkies, Púca, etc.)

**Nature:** Beings of transformation and threshold. They move between forms, between worlds, between categories. They understand change in ways fixed beings cannot.

**Power Level:** Depends on the individual, but shapeshifters tend to be clever, adaptable, and dangerous when cornered.

**Examples:**
- **Selkies** — Seal-folk who shed skins to walk on land
- **Púca** — Shapeshifters who can become any animal (or person)
- **Swan-maidens** — Bird-women whose feather-cloaks grant flight
- **Kitsune** — Fox-spirits with multiple tails (rare in the West)

**Where Found:** Boundaries. Coastlines, riverbanks, edges of forests, places where one thing becomes another.

**Post-Passing Status:** The shapeshifters were less affected than other Fae—transformation is their nature, so the Passing's disruption of boundaries was... familiar? Some report that shifting is *harder* now, that the boundaries fight back. Others say it's *easier*, that the barriers between forms are thinner.

**The Question:** Are the shapeshifters becoming more powerful, or is the world becoming more fluid? And is that good or terrible?

---

## Fae Culture and Customs

### The Geas (Sacred Obligation)

When a Fae gives their word, it is *binding*. Not metaphorically—literally binding. A Fae who breaks an oath suffers physically, spiritually, magically. This is why Fae are so careful with language.

**Implications:**
- Fae never lie (but truth can be misdirection)
- Fae honor bargains precisely (which may not be what you thought)
- Forcing a Fae to break an oath is among the worst crimes
- Mortals who keep oaths to the Fae gain standing; those who break them become prey

**Post-Passing Complication:** Some humans made oaths they could no longer keep because the Passing killed their families, destroyed their lands, or made the promised action impossible. The Fae are divided on whether this constitutes oath-breaking (you failed to fulfill it) or release (the world changed beyond your control).

---

### Hospitality (Sacred and Binding)

Offer a Fae food and shelter, and they are bound to peace within your home. Accept food and shelter from a Fae, and you are bound to their rules while under their roof.

**The Rules:**
- Guest-right is inviolable (Geal-sí and Scáth-sí always honor it; Dorcha-sí honor it precisely, which can be dangerous)
- Salt and iron break hospitality (never bring them to a Fae table)
- Leaving a Fae's hospitality can be... complicated (time moves differently, doors don't always lead where you expect)

**The Trap:** Accept Fae food and you may find a year has passed outside, or that you can no longer stomach mortal food, or that you've contracted an obligation you didn't understand.

**Post-Passing Change:** Some Fae have closed their doors. They offer no hospitality because they don't want to be bound to peace with mortals. Others have become more generous—feeding starving refugees, sheltering the lost—because they remember that humans, too, once fled war.

---

### The Courts (Political Structure)

The Fae don't have a central government. They have courts—gatherings of power that shift with the seasons, the land, and internal politics.

**The Seasonal Courts (Most Common Structure):**

| Court          | Season | Ruler Type           | Character                          |
| -------------- | ------ | -------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Spring**     | Growth | The Maiden/Green Man | Renewal, hope, reckless youth      |
| **Summer**     | Peak   | The Oak King         | Strength, abundance, glory         |
| **Autumn**     | Decay  | The Hunter/Crone     | Harvest, preparation, hard choices |
| **Winter**     | Death  | The Cailleach        | Endings, survival, cold truth      |

**Court Membership:** Fae align with courts based on nature, preference, or circumstance. A Scáth-sí might serve different courts at different times. A Geal-sí might still attend Winter Court councils.

**Court Gatherings:** Occur at solstices, equinoxes, and certain sacred nights. These are when political decisions are made, disputes settled, and mortals most likely to stumble into something dangerous.

**Post-Passing Status:** The courts still meet, but the balance is off. Spring came late this year. Summer was too hot. Winter refuses to leave some places. The seasonal cycle is *wrong*, and the courts don't know if this is temporary or permanent.

---

### Names and True Speech

A Fae's true name is *power*. Know it, and you have leverage. Speak it correctly, and you can call them. Give yours to them, and they can do the same to you.

**The Practice:**
- Fae introduce themselves with use-names: "You may call me Thorn" / "I am known as Silverfoot"
- Asking a true name is profound intimacy or profound threat
- Mortals who learn true names should guard them carefully
- Speaking a true name casually is insult; speaking it in bargaining is power play

**Why It Matters:** True names are tied to identity. Change the name, change the being. This is why Fae are so careful about how they're addressed.

**Post-Passing Development:** Some Fae have started using human names as use-names—"Call me John" or "I'm Mary Green." This is either mockery, adaptation, or something stranger. The older Fae find it disturbing.

---

### Time (It Works Differently)

A night in a Fae mound can be a year outside. A year in Faerie can be an hour in mortal lands. Time is fluid, negotiable, strange.

**The Rules (Such As They Are):**
- Time moves according to attention and engagement
- The more you're drawn in, the slower time passes outside
- Food, drink, and dancing accelerate the effect
- Iron, salt, and mortal prayers anchor you to mortal time
- Leaving can snap you forward (aging suddenly) or backward (returning to when you left)

**The Danger:** People who spend too long in Fae lands lose their connection to mortal time entirely. They become *timeless*—which sounds good until you realize you can't relate to anyone anymore, your loved ones age and die, and mortal concerns feel like mayfly flickers.

**Post-Passing Effect:** Time distortions have gotten *worse*. Travelers report losing weeks when they swore it was only a night. Fae report mortal time moving too fast—centuries of growth happening in decades. Something about the Passing destabilized temporal boundaries.

---

## Leadership and Hierarchy

### The High Courts (Seasonal Rulers)

**The Oak King (Summer Court)**

*Current Holder:* Crowned ages ago; no mortal knows his true name
*Disposition:* Geal-sí leaning
*Domain:* The Kingswood's heart, midsummer heights, oak groves
*Character:* Generous, proud, traditional, loving of oaths and grand gestures
*Goal:* Restore the land to health; maintain Fae sovereignty over wild places
*Complication:* Bound by ancient compact to *not* drive humans from the Kingswood, but that compact assumed humans would honor their end

**Current Action:** Considering whether the compact is void due to human failure, or whether it binds regardless.

---

**The Cailleach (Winter Court)**

*Current Holder:* Older than memory; some say she's always held the role
*Disposition:* Dorcha-sí
*Domain:* High peaks, frozen lochs, winter winds, the longest night
*Character:* Harsh, ancient, terrifyingly wise, patient as stone
*Goal:* Let winter claim what summer cannot save; cut away the dead so new growth can come
*Complication:* What she considers "dead" might include entire human communities

**Current Action:** Watching. Waiting. Winter came early this year and stayed late. Some wonder if she's expanding her domain.

---

**The Maiden of Spring (Spring Court)**

*Current Holder:* Changes every generation; the role is passed, not held forever
*Current Holder's Name:* Hawthorn's Daughter
*Disposition:* Scáth-sí (mirrors hope and despair)
*Domain:* First flowers, dawn, lambing season, snow-melt streams
*Character:* Young (for a Fae), hopeful but brittle, scarred by the Passing
*Goal:* Believe that renewal is still possible; prove the Dorcha-sí wrong about mortals
*Complication:* Half the Spring Court disagrees with her; she rules a fractured domain

**Current Action:** Reaching out to humans who still honor old ways, testing whether alliances can be rebuilt.

---

**The Hunter (Autumn Court)**

*Current Holder:* The Wild Huntsman, name unknown
*Disposition:* Dorcha-sí leaning, but honors balance
*Domain:* The harvest, the hunt, preparation for winter, hard choices
*Character:* Stern, pragmatic, frightening but fair
*Goal:* Ensure the Fae survive what's coming, even if that means cutting ties with mortals
*Complication:* Some of his court have gone rogue, hunting mortals for sport rather than judgment

**Current Action:** Calling in debts, gathering resources, preparing for scarcity.

---

### Regional Powers (Independent of Courts)

Not all Fae serve the courts. Some are too old, too strange, or too local.

**The Lady of the Lake (Lacus Coronarum)**

*Type:* Naiad (water-spirit)
*Disposition:* Scáth-sí
*Domain:* The Mere of Crowns, the water between the capitals
*Character:* Ancient, enigmatic, holds many secrets
*Goal:* Unknown, but she's been more active since the Passing
*Complication:* Both Aurheim and Vandgwyn want her favor, but she grants it to neither

**Current Action:** Appearing to people in dreams, pulling drowned things from the deep, watching the human cities with interest she hasn't shown in centuries.

---

**The Master of Thorns (Kingswood)**

*Type:* Green Man (ancient)
*Disposition:* Dorcha-sí
*Domain:* The deepest, oldest part of the forest where paths cannot be mapped
*Character:* Silent, hostile, protective of what mortals shouldn't see
*Goal:* Keep mortals out of the Deep Wood
*Complication:* The Deep Wood is expanding

**Current Action:** The Master has been seen (rare) at the forest's edge, as if establishing a perimeter. The implication: Do not pass this line.

---

**The Púca King (No Fixed Domain)**

*Type:* Shapeshifter (Púca)
*Disposition:* Scáth-sí
*Domain:* Wherever he wishes, but favors crossroads and boundaries
*Character:* Trickster, teacher, dangerous when offended, generous when amused
*Goal:* Unknown—púca goals are inscrutable
*Complication:* Serves no court, owes no loyalty, follows no predictable pattern

**Current Action:** Appearing as various animals to travelers, offering bargains, setting tests. Some who pass his tests receive gifts. Some who fail are never seen again.

---

## Goals and Tensions

### Primary Goals

1. **Protect the Land:** The Fae's fundamental purpose is tending Alys's sleeping form. The Passing wounded the land; healing it is paramount.

2. **Decide Humanity's Fate:** Should humans be driven from the wild places? Allowed to stay if they reform? Punished for failure?

3. **Survive the Changing World:** The Passing changed rules the Fae thought were fixed. They must adapt or diminish.

### Secondary Goals

- **Maintain Sovereignty:** The Fae will not be ruled by mortals, gods, or dragons
- **Honor Ancient Compacts:** Many Fae are bound by oaths made centuries ago
- **Resolve Internal Divisions:** The three dispositions are fracturing further

### Internal Tensions

**The Isolationists vs. The Integrationists:**

Some Fae want to close Faerie entirely—no more contact with mortals until mortals prove they can be trusted over generations. Others argue this abandons humans at their moment of greatest need, when Fae guidance could prevent worse catastrophe.

**Generational Divide:**

Older Fae remember when mortals were refugees fleeing divine war. They remember vulnerability, desperation, and ultimately, kindness shown. Younger Fae have only seen human expansion, exploitation, and now failure. The two generations draw different conclusions.

**Court Rivalries:**

Spring and Summer traditionally allied against Autumn and Winter. Post-Passing, this is breaking down. Summer is angry (humans failed). Spring is hopeful (humans can learn). Autumn is pragmatic (cut losses). Winter is vindicated (I told you so). No stable coalitions.

**The Scarred Problem:**

Some Fae were *changed* by the Passing—not killed, but altered in ways even other Fae don't understand. They're called the Scarred, and they don't fit the three dispositions anymore. What do you do with Fae who've become something new?

### External Tensions

**With the Church:**

The Solarian Church tried to suppress Fae worship, calling it "demon-traffic." The Fae responded by withdrawing blessings from Christian communities. Now the Church has failed, and the Fae are deciding whether to gloat or grieve.

**With the Old Traditions:**

The Alysian folk practitioners are natural allies, but the Passing has complicated everything. Some human practitioners are doing emergency magic that violates protocols. The Fae understand desperation, but desperation doesn't excuse harm.

**With the Goleuwyr (Elves):**

Complex. Both are ancient peoples. Both remember the time before mortals. But elves are *from* the Light realm, while Fae are *of* the Land. The relationship is cordial but distant. Some Fae resent that elves get to be beautiful and tragic refugees while Fae get to be "monsters."

**With the Dragon-Kin:**

Mutual respect between ancient peoples. The dragons withdrew rather than rule; the Fae respect this. But the dragons are Alys's children too—technically siblings to the Fae. That can get complicated.

**With the Theosyn (Old Gods):**

The gods walked the land before the Hawthorne. The Fae remember this. Some Fae served certain gods. Now the gods are waking up, and some are calling in ancient debts. The Fae are... considering.

---

## Assets and Resources

### Material Resources

- **The Deep Places:** Locations mortals cannot map, where reality works differently
- **The Paths Between:** Routes through the land that bypass normal geography
- **Living Treasures:** Items that are alive—swords that sing, cloaks that hide, mirrors that show truth

### Institutional Power

- **None Formal:** The Fae have no written laws, no buildings, no bureaucracy
- **Immense Informal:** Control of sacred sites, knowledge of true names, ability to grant or withhold blessings

### Military/Enforcement

- **The Wild Hunt:** Spectral riders who hunt oath-breakers and Fae enemies
- **The Thorn Guard:** The Master of Thorns's enforcers in the Deep Wood
- **Individual Power:** A single Sidhe is more dangerous than a company of soldiers

### Knowledge and Secrets

- **The Names:** True names of places, people, spirits
- **The Paths:** How to reach places that don't appear on maps
- **The Lore:** Pre-human history, the God-Giant War, Katiari's sacrifice
- **The Bargains:** Who owes what to whom, going back millennia

**The Deepest Secret:** The well-disposed Fae helped Katiari create humanity. Some of them remember the youngest sister before she had to be forgotten. The Fae know more about humanity's origin than humans do.

---

## Relationships

### Allied Factions

- **Alysian Folk Practitioners** — Natural allies, mutual respect, shared goals
- **Forest Elves** — Live in harmony with the deep woods, honor the same traditions
- **The Monastics** — Some contemplative orders preserved Fae lore; the Fae remember
- **Certain Ostaran Communities** — Death and Land are sister-realms; crossover is natural

### Neutral Factions

- **The Goleuwyr (Light Elves)** — Cordial but distant
- **Dragon-Kin** — Ancient respect, minimal interaction
- **The Uraeun (Threshold Keepers)** — Professional courtesy between boundary-watchers
- **Shiranui** — Minimal contact, but shared respect for nature spirits

### Hostile Factions

- **The Scouring** — Actively burning Fae sites, hunting "demons"
- **The Church Hierarchy** — Centuries of suppression not forgotten
- **Certain Human Lords** — Those who've broken compacts, despoiled sacred sites
- **The Changed/Scarred Reft** — Something wrong about them; Fae kill them on sight

### Complicated Relationships

**With Humanity Generally:**

Not allies. Not enemies. A relationship in crisis, being renegotiated in real-time. Individual humans might find Fae aid, hospitality, or violence depending on their actions and the Fae they encounter.

**With the Theosyn Revival:**

Some gods the Fae served loyally. Some gods the Fae fought against. The gods waking up and remembering Fae allies is... potentially very good or very bad.

## Adventure Hooks

### 1. The Closing Path

**Situation:** A village has relied on a forest path to reach their fields for generations. The path leads through what was neutral Fae territory—the local Fae tolerated it as long as travelers left offerings. Post-Passing, the path has *closed*. It physically still exists, but walking it leads you in circles. The village faces starvation without access to those fields.

**The Question:** Why did the Fae close the path, and what will it take to reopen it?

**Complications:**
- The local Fae (a Scáth-sí spirit) is reflecting village behavior—they've stopped leaving offerings
- But the villagers stopped because the Fae "failed" to prevent the Passing
- Both sides feel betrayed and justified
- A faction in the village wants to cut down the forest; a faction wants reconciliation
- The spirit will negotiate, but the price has gone up

**Possible Resolutions:**
- Restore the offerings and negotiate a new compact
- Find an alternate route (dangerous, longer, but Fae-free)
- Bargain with a different Fae for access
- Escalate to violence (catastrophic)

---

### 2. The Stolen Child

**Situation:** A child has been taken from her bed. The window was open, and hawthorn berries were left on the pillow—the traditional sign of Fae abduction. The parents are distraught. The community is divided: some say the Fae must have had cause (was the child promised?), others say this is an act of war.

**The Question:** Why did the Fae take the child, and can she be recovered?

**Complications:**
- The child's grandmother made a bargain three generations ago: "One child from this line to serve as payment"
- The grandmother never told anyone
- The Fae are technically in the right (oath was made, payment is due)
- But the child is innocent and terrified
- The Fae who took her is Geal-sí—not cruel, actually quite kind, but bound by oath
- The parents want to storm Faerie; the grandmother is dying and can't explain

**Possible Resolutions:**
- Negotiate a substitute payment (what would a Fae accept instead?)
- Find a loophole in the original bargain
- Challenge the Fae to a contest (they respect cleverness)
- The child might not want to come back (Faerie is... appealing)
- Free the Fae from their oath (but how?)

---

### 3. The Scarred Grove

**Situation:** A sacred grove that has stood for millennia is *wrong*. The trees are twisted, the light doesn't fall correctly, and the Green Man who tended it has become something else—hostile, incoherent, dangerous. The grove is expanding slowly, and if it reaches the nearby village, everyone fears what will happen.

**The Question:** What happened to the Green Man, and can the grove be healed or must it be destroyed?

**Complications:**
- The Passing scarred this place specifically
- The Green Man is now one of the "Scarred"—Fae changed by eldritch contact
- Other Fae are terrified of the Scarred (they don't understand what they've become)
- The grove may be expanding because the Green Man is trying to reach something, or because he's spreading wrongness, or both
- Destroying the grove might kill the Green Man (ending his suffering) or release something worse
- A faction of Fae wants to quarantine it; another wants to mercy-kill him; a third wants to study what happened

**Possible Resolutions:**
- Find a way to communicate with the Scarred Green Man
- Seek help from the Ti-Abzu or Ostaran tradition (they understand wrongness)
- Quarantine the grove until a solution is found
- A mercy-killing if the Green Man requests it
- The grove might be the key to understanding what the Passing actually was

---

### 4. The Revoked Blessing

**Situation:** A noble house has held their lands for five centuries under a compact with the local Fae: protection from blight and flood in exchange for leaving certain groves untouched. The current lord, desperate after the Passing destroyed his crops, ordered the sacred groves cut down for timber. The Fae responded by revoking *all* blessings—not just future ones, but retroactively. Five centuries of protection are unraveling. The manor is flooding. The fields are blighted. The family line itself may be cursed.

**The Question:** Can the Fae's anger be appeased, or has the lord crossed a line that cannot be uncrossed?

**Complications:**
- The lord acted in desperation to save his people from starvation
- The Fae consider this no excuse (the compact was clear)
- The lord's heir is sympathetic but powerless
- The retroactive curse means the manor is structurally unsound (five centuries of subtle Fae preservation is gone)
- People are dying (flooding, disease, accidents)
- The Fae are Dorcha-sí—not interested in mercy, interested in justice

**Possible Resolutions:**
- The lord abdicates and submits to Fae judgment (what will they do to him?)
- The heir negotiates a new compact (what price would suffice?)
- Find a Geal-sí or Scáth-sí willing to intercede
- Abandon the manor and lands (retreat)
- War with the Fae (suicide, but some lords are proud)

---

### 5. The Seasonal Disruption

**Situation:** Spring didn't come to a region. It's been winter for eight months straight. Crops won't grow. Animals won't breed. The cold is killing people. Divination suggests the Spring Court and Winter Court are in conflict—the Maiden of Spring wants to forgive humanity, the Cailleach wants to let winter claim them. The dispute has escalated to the point that the seasonal cycle itself has broken.

**The Question:** Can the dispute between courts be resolved, or must mortals survive without the seasons?

**Complications:**
- Both courts have legitimate grievances
- The Oak King (Summer) is staying neutral (summer can't come without spring anyway)
- The Hunter (Autumn) is pragmatic—if this continues, all mortals die, which solves nothing
- Other regions are having opposite problems (endless summer, no autumn)
- The Fae themselves are suffering (seasonal Fae are weakened when out-of-season)
- Gods are paying attention (this affects their domains too)

**Possible Resolutions:**
- Broker a compromise between the Maiden and the Cailleach
- Prove to the Cailleach that humans can change
- Find a way to bypass the need for Fae-governed seasons (magical/technological alternative)
- Appeal to a higher power (Alys herself? The Oak King?)
- Migrate to regions where seasons still work

---

### 6. The Bridge Between Worlds

**Situation:** A Fae has fallen in love with a mortal. This is not unprecedented but always complicated. The mortal is aging; the Fae is not. The Fae offers a choice: come live in Faerie (and lose connection to mortal time), or let the Fae become mortal (and lose their power and immortality). But there's a third option—a ritual that could make the mortal partially Fae, extending their life and granting them some Fae nature. The catch: the ritual requires a sacrifice. Someone else must give up their connection to either the mortal world or Faerie.

**The Question:** What should they do, and who would make the sacrifice?

**Complications:**
- The mortal's family opposes this (they'll lose their child either way)
- The Fae's court disapproves (such unions weaken both sides)
- The ritual is old and dangerous (things can go wrong)
- A willing sacrifice must be found
- The Púca King appears, offering to broker the deal (his prices are never clear)
- What happens to children of such a union?

**Possible Resolutions:**
- One chooses to join the other's world (but which?)
- They find a willing sacrifice (but who would do this, and why?)
- The Púca's bargain (what does he want in return?)
- They refuse the choice and live with mortal lifespans together
- The ritual fails (catastrophically)

### 7. The Hunt Comes

**Situation:** The Wild Hunt has been called. Spectral riders led by the Hunter himself race across the sky, pursuing something. Anyone caught outside when the Hunt passes is in danger—they might be swept up, tested, hunted. The Hunt hasn't ridden in a century. Its return means something significant.

**The Question:** What is the Hunt pursuing, and can it be stopped or aided?

**Complications:**
- The Hunt is after an oath-breaker (who may or may not deserve it)
- OR: The Hunt is after something from the Passing (Scarred Fae, Reft, something worse)
- Local authorities want to "defend" against the Hunt (would be slaughter)
- The pursued might seek sanctuary with mortals (will you grant it?)
- Joining the Hunt is possible (but you might never leave)
- The Hunt follows ancient rules (which can be exploited if you know them)

**Possible Resolutions:**
- Stay inside and let the Hunt pass
- Help the Hunt achieve its goal (become temporary riders)
- Protect the hunted (offer sanctuary, hide them, bargain with the Hunter)
- Determine if the Hunt's target is just (and act accordingly)
- Discover what triggered the Hunt's calling

## Current Status and Future Trajectory

### Immediate Situation (Months Post-Passing)

The Fae are **closed for business**. The Kingswood doesn't allow passage. Sacred sites that once welcomed visitors now repel them. Offerings left at traditional places are found untouched.

**What They're Doing:**
- Healing the land where they can
- Deliberating in councils that last weeks (in mortal time)
- Testing humans who seek contact
- Fighting among themselves about the path forward

**What Mortals Notice:**
- Paths that worked don't
- Old bargains feel void
- Fae who were friendly have vanished
- Fae who were neutral have become hostile
- Strange things happen to those who disrespect sacred sites

### Medium-Term Trajectory (1-3 Years)

The Fae will make a decision. Not all Fae (they don't work that way), but the *courts* will decide.

**Possible Outcomes:**

**Isolation:** The Kingswood and other sacred sites become truly closed. No mortal access. Fae withdraw from mortal affairs entirely. This protects Fae but abandons humans.

**Conditional Engagement:** Fae return but with stricter rules. New compacts. Higher prices. Mortals must prove themselves worthy. The old, easy relationship is gone.

**Alliance:** Some Fae (likely Spring Court, some Scáth-sí) ally with humans actively trying to heal the world. But this deepens the rift between Fae factions.

**War:** Unlikely but possible. If the Scouring continues burning sacred sites, if lords continue exploiting Fae lands, if Church persecution resumes—the Fae might decide humanity is an infestation to be removed.

### Long-Term Trajectory (Decades)

**The Fae Endure:** They've survived the God-Giant War, the migration, the rise of the Empire, the Church's suppression, and now the Passing. They will survive what comes next. The question isn't Fae survival—it's what shape they'll take.

**Possible Futures:**

**The Hidden People:** Fae become myth again. Fewer and fewer mortals see them. They retreat into the deep places and become stories grandmothers tell.

**The New Compact:** A re-forged relationship with humanity. Different from before, but functional. The Fae re-engage with mortals on new terms.

**The Divided Folk:** The Fae split permanently. Some isolate, some integrate, some war. The unity of "Fae" as a category dissolves into factions that barely recognize each other.

**The Return of the Wild:** If humanity continues to collapse, the Fae might simply... wait. Let civilization fall. Reclaim the land. Become the dominant people of Azurea again.

**The Hero's Path:** If someone finds Katiari and brings back the forgotten sister, the Fae will know. They helped create humanity; they remember the youngest sister more clearly than most. Katiari's return could change everything—the Fae might be the key to her re-integration, or they might demand an accounting for what humanity has done with the gift she gave.

## Using the Fae in Your Game

### As Allies
- Grant blessings, safe passage, knowledge
- Test characters to prove worthiness
- Offer bargains that are fair but demanding
- Become mentors in Alysian/Land magic

### As Obstacles
- Close paths characters need
- Demand impossible prices
- Enforce ancient laws characters don't know
- Punish disrespect (intentional or accidental)

### As Mysteries
- Appear and disappear without explanation
- Leave cryptic gifts and messages
- Know things they shouldn't
- Operate according to rules players must deduce

### As Reflections
- Mirror party behavior (Scáth-sí specialty)
- Reward respect, punish exploitation
- Show characters what they're becoming
- Offer choices that reveal character

### Key Principles

1. **The Fae are People:** Not monsters, not gods, *people*. Ancient, strange, powerful people with their own cultures, politics, and problems.

2. **Words Matter:** Everything a Fae says is technically true. Everything they promise, they will deliver—exactly.

3. **Hospitality is Sacred:** Break guest-right and you've made an eternal enemy. Honor it and you're protected.

4. **The Land Remembers:** Sacred sites are real. Old oaths are binding. Geography has memory.

5. **Bargains are Everything:** The currency of Fae interaction. Never agree to a deal you don't understand.

6. **They're Deciding About Us:** The Fae are watching humanity's response to catastrophe. Every interaction is being evaluated. The future relationship depends on what they conclude.

---

*The Fae remember when the world was young. They remember when mortals were refugees, desperate and grateful. They remember the promises made and the promises broken. They remember the youngest sister before she had to hide. And they are deciding whether humanity deserves another chance, or whether the land would be better off without them.*

*Choose your words carefully.*
