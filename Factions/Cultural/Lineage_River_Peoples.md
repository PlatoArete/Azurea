| **Status**          | Active but Disrupted                                                                                                                           |
| **Scope**           | Continental (every major river system)                                                                                                         |
| **Primary Base**    | No permanent settlements; constant movement along river networks                                                                               |
| **Symbol/Heraldry** | The Spiral Current (water flowing in overlapping circles, representing the journey from source to sea and back as rain)                        |
| **Common Names**    | River Folk, Water Serpents, the Flow-Walkers, En-He-Dao ("Way-of-Water" in Sino-Atargatan), the Endless Travelers, Stream-Dancers (respectful), River-Snakes (neutral to derogatory) |

### Summary

The En-He-Dao are serpentine river-dwellers who embody the Atargatan principle of constant flow. Where other peoples settle and build, the En-He-Dao *travel*—not as nomads seeking better territory, but as embodiments of water's fundamental nature. To them, life *is* journey, movement *is* being, and stopping is a form of death.

They are not a unified nation but a network of family-streams that follow specific river systems from headwaters to delta and back again in endless cycles. Each family-stream knows its river intimately—every rapids, every pool, every seasonal change—and serves as its guardian, memory, and voice. They practice Canyon-Singing (using resonant sound to help water erode stone over generations), River-Reading (understanding water's messages), and the Way of Wu Wei (accomplishing through yielding rather than forcing).

Their serpentine bodies are adapted perfectly for river life: streamlined, flexible, with specialized organs for temperature regulation in waters ranging from icy mountain streams to warm southern deltas. They can breathe air or extract oxygen from water, spending hours submerged or basking on sun-warmed rocks as needed. Their scales shift color with temperature and emotion, creating a subtle language of mood and intent.

Before the Passing, the En-He-Dao served as the Empire's river-knowledge experts—pilot-guides for merchant boats, negotiators between upstream and downstream communities, living charts of seasonal flood patterns. They had no political power but enormous practical influence: controlling river traffic meant controlling trade, and their refusal to guide could devastate regional economies.

### Post-Passing Crisis

The Passing contaminated the water cycle. What the Atargatan peoples call "Wrong Rain" fell from skies poisoned by the Eldritch creatures' passage. That rain entered rivers. Those rivers entered the En-He-Dao.

Some died immediately—their sensitive organs couldn't process the contamination. Others went mad, their usually calm dispositions shattered by whatever wrongness the water carried. Many simply stopped moving, coiling in place, unable to continue their journeys. For a people whose identity *is* movement, this paralysis is worse than death.

The survivors now face cascading crises: contaminated rivers they must still inhabit, disrupted trade networks they once facilitated, human desperation driving people to pollute waters further, and a creeping sense that something is spreading through the underground water-veins—something dark, fibrous, that dissolves structure itself.

## 2. Nature & Biology

### Serpentine Adaptation

The En-He-Dao are distinctly serpentine, though their exact form varies by branch:

| Feature                | Description                                                                                                                                   |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Body Structure**     | Long, sinuous, ranging from 10-18 feet in length; arms/hands for manipulation, no legs (pure serpentine locomotion)                          |
| **Scales**             | Fine, overlapping, color-shifting (blues, greens, silvers, occasionally copper or bronze tints)                                               |
| **Temperature Sense**  | Can detect minute temperature changes in water (essential for reading currents and seasons)                                                   |
| **Dual Breathing**     | Functional lungs for air *and* specialized gills behind the jaw for underwater breathing                                                      |
| **Nictitating Membrane** | Transparent protective eyelid for underwater vision; can see clearly above and below surface                                                  |
| **Pressure Organs**    | Sense water pressure/flow direction; navigate even in complete darkness by "feeling" current                                                  |
| **Flexible Spine**     | Extraordinary flexibility; can tie themselves in knots, slip through narrow passages                                                          |
| **Tongue-Tasting**     | Forked tongue that "tastes" water chemistry, detecting pollution, temperature, even emotional traces left by other En-He-Dao                  |
| **Sound Chambers**     | Specialized vocal structures for producing complex underwater sounds; basis of Canyon-Singing                                                 |

**Sexual Dimorphism:**
Minimal. Gender is fluid and often context-dependent among En-He-Dao. Many are what humans would call hermaphroditic; reproduction requires mutual exchange over multiple encounters. Gender expression (when acknowledged at all) tends toward describing flow-states rather than fixed identities.

### The Four Branches

The En-He-Dao differentiate themselves by which part of the river-system they primarily inhabit:

#### Mountain-Born (Shān-Liú)

**Environment:** Headwaters, fast-flowing streams, waterfalls, cold mountain lakes

**Adaptations:**
- Smaller, more streamlined (10-12 feet)
- Powerful muscles for swimming against strong currents
- Higher metabolic rate (generating body heat in cold water)
- Scales tend toward silver and pale blue
- Exceptional grip strength for holding position in rapids

**Character:**
Fast-moving, quick-speaking, direct. Impatient with valley dwellers' "slow" pace. First to sense changes upstream (and often first to encounter contamination). Fierce defenders of water sources.

**Relationship to Rivers:**
"The water here is young, pure, urgent. It doesn't know itself yet. We teach it the way."

---

#### Valley-Folk (Gǔ-Liú)

**Environment:** Wide rivers, moderate flows, trading centers, agricultural regions

**Adaptations:**
- Medium build (12-15 feet)
- Balanced speed and endurance
- Scales in deeper blues and greens
- Best temperature tolerance range (adapt to seasonal changes)
- Most developed hands/manual dexterity (for trade goods handling)

**Character:**
Patient, diplomatic, commercially minded. The "face" of En-He-Dao to most humans. Skilled negotiators and mediators. Most likely to have sustained relationships with land-dwellers.

**Relationship to Rivers:**
"The water here is mature, purposeful, connecting. It knows its work. We facilitate it."

---

#### Delta-Dwellers (Hé-Kǒu)

**Environment:** River deltas, estuaries, salt-fresh mixing zones, tidal rivers

**Adaptations:**
- Largest branch (14-18 feet)
- Can tolerate brackish and salt water (unique among En-He-Dao)
- Scales with iridescent quality, copper and bronze tints
- Stronger stomach acids (omnivorous; eat wider range of foods)
- Sensitive to tidal rhythms

**Character:**
Contemplative, philosophical, slow to anger but implacable when roused. Most mystical branch—they see where river becomes sea and often gain spiritual insights from the transition. Deep connections to Atargatan tradition.

**Relationship to Rivers:**
"The water here is fulfilled, completing. It achieves its purpose by becoming something else. We witness the transformation."

---

#### Underground-Swimmers (Dì-Xià-Liú)

**Environment:** Underground rivers, aquifer systems, cave networks, deep springs

**Adaptations:**
- Pale, almost translucent scales (white, very pale blue)
- Blind or near-blind (vestigial eyes)
- Extraordinary echolocation and pressure-sense
- Bioluminescent patches (communicate in darkness)
- Smaller (10-13 feet) but incredibly tough

**Character:**
Mysterious, secretive, rarely encountered. Speak little and often cryptically. Keepers of deep knowledge—they know where waters connect underground, where aquifers meet, where the "wrong growth" (the Ivy) is spreading beneath the surface.

**Relationship to Rivers:**
"The water here is hidden, patient, ancient. It remembers what surface has forgotten. We guard the memory."

---

### Lifecycle & Reproduction

**Birth:**
- Eggs laid in protected shallows (gravel nests, pool eddies)
- Clutch size: 2-8 eggs
- Incubation: 3-4 months
- Parents guard nest in shifts; both contribute

**Youth (The Tumbling):**
- First 20 years: learning to swim, navigate, understand currents
- Travel with family-stream, protected by adults
- Begin learning Canyon-Singing through mimicry
- First solo journey around age 15 (supervised from distance)

**Adulthood (The Flowing):**
- Age 20-200: active participation in family-stream journeys
- Peak strength, speed, fertility
- Most trading, guiding, Canyon-Singing happens in this phase
- May branch off to form new family-streams (though this is becoming rare)

**Elderhood (The Deepening):**
- Age 200+: slowing down but gaining wisdom
- Often transition to Delta-Dweller areas (slower waters)
- Become teachers, historians, philosophers
- Some become so slow they essentially settle—disturbing to younger En-He-Dao

**Death (The Merging):**
Bodies returned to the river, weighted with meaningful stones. Belief: consciousness merges with water itself, becoming part of the eternal flow. The dead don't "go" anywhere—they become everywhere the water goes.

---

## 3. Philosophy & Worldview

### The Core Teaching: "The River is the Sea's Becoming"

This phrase encapsulates En-He-Dao philosophy:

**Life is Process, Not State:**
You are not a thing that flows—you *are* the flowing. Identity is movement, not fixed essence. Asking "who are you" makes less sense than asking "where are you going."

**Destination and Origin Are One:**
The river flows to sea, becomes sea, evaporates, falls as rain, returns to mountain. There is no "end"—only transformation and return. Death is not ending but changing phase.

**Resistance Creates Suffering:**
Water doesn't fight the riverbed; it shapes it through patient yielding. The hardest stone wears away before the softest water. Force is futile; flow is inevitable.

**Everything Connects Eventually:**
All waters meet eventually—mountain stream and southern delta, underground aquifer and ocean deep. Separation is temporary; connection is fundamental.

### Wu Wei (Effortless Action)

The En-He-Dao practice the Atargatan principle of accomplishing through yielding:

**In Navigation:**
- Don't fight the current; use it
- Let the river carry you when it wants to
- Resist only when resistance serves the flow

**In Negotiation:**
- Don't argue positions; find the natural path of agreement
- Let others feel they've "won" while actually guiding outcome
- The best deal flows naturally from circumstances

**In Canyon-Singing:**
- Don't force the water to erode; help it do what it already wants
- Patient encouragement over millennia accomplishes more than violent assault
- The stone yields because the water never demands

**In Relationships:**
- Don't cling to people; let them flow through your life
- Forcing someone to stay is like trying to hold water in your fists
- What truly belongs to you returns through its own nature

### The Journey Philosophy

"Life is a flow from mountain to sea."

This shapes everything about En-He-Dao culture:

**No Permanent Homes:**
Building a fixed dwelling would be like asking a river to stop. Family-streams carry everything they need with them—stored in waterproof baskets, cached in secret pools, or simply remembered.

**Restlessness as Health:**
Staying in one place too long causes physical and spiritual illness. The En-He-Dao who survived the Passing but can't move anymore are suffering not just from contamination but from the paralysis itself.

**Possessions Are Burdens:**
Own only what you can carry, what flows with you. The greatest wealth is knowledge of the river—where deep pools hide, when floods come, where safe passages lie.

**Relationships Are Temporary:**
Family-streams may split and merge. Individuals may travel together for years, then part without drama. Even deep love is understood as "flowing together for now"—not less meaningful for being temporary.

---

## 4. Social Structure

### Family-Streams (Liú-Jiā)

The basic social unit. A family-stream consists of:

| Members                  | Typical Number | Role                                                    |
| ------------------------ | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Core Adults**          | 3-8            | Experienced navigators who know the full river system   |
| **Elders**               | 1-3            | Teachers, historians, decision-makers in crises         |
| **Mid-Adults**           | 5-12           | Primary workers—guiding, trading, Canyon-Singing        |
| **Youth**                | 4-10           | Learning, helping, eventually splitting off             |
| **Associated Travelers** | Variable       | Non-family who travel with the stream temporarily       |

**Leadership:**
Not hierarchical but consensus-based. Elders' voices carry weight, but decisions emerge from group discussion, often while swimming together (the rhythm of movement facilitates thinking).

**Territory:**
Each family-stream "belongs to" a specific river system. This isn't ownership—it's responsibility. They know that river intimately and serve as its memory and guardian. Other En-He-Dao respect these bonds—you don't guide boats on another family's river without permission.

**The Cycle:**
Most family-streams complete their river's full journey yearly:
1. Winter: Delta regions (warmer waters, easier living)
2. Spring: Upriver migration (following spawning fish)
3. Summer: Mountain headwaters (cool waters, renewed sources)
4. Autumn: Downstream journey (trading, preparing for winter)

### The Great Gatherings

Twice yearly, multiple family-streams converge at sacred confluence points:

**Spring Gathering (Chūn-Huì):**
- At major river junctions
- Courtship, reproduction, egg-laying
- Exchange of news, knowledge, trade goods
- Canyon-Singing competitions
- Duration: 2-3 weeks

**Autumn Gathering (Qiū-Huì):**
- At delta regions before winter dispersal
- Settling disputes, negotiating river-rights
- Formal teaching (elders train youth)
- Preparation for winter (caching supplies)
- Duration: 3-4 weeks

Since the Passing, these gatherings have been smaller, tenser, sometimes canceled entirely.

### Roles Within Family-Streams

| Role                | Function                                                                         |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Navigator**       | Reads currents, leads journeys, knows the deep channels                          |
| **Singer**          | Practices Canyon-Singing, maintains sound-traditions                             |
| **Trader**          | Interfaces with land-dwellers, negotiates deals                                  |
| **Guard**           | Protects the stream from threats (rare—usually diplomatic solutions preferred)   |
| **Teacher**         | Educates youth, preserves oral history                                           |
| **Healer**          | Tends injuries, reads water-contamination, treats illness                        |
| **Scout**           | Swims ahead to check conditions, spots danger                                    |

Most En-He-Dao rotate through multiple roles based on need and aptitude.

## 5. Culture & Practice

### Canyon-Singing (Xiá-Gē)

The most sacred and distinctive En-He-Dao practice:

**What It Is:**
Using precisely tuned vocal resonance underwater to help water erode stone over generations. Not magic in the usual sense—it's applied understanding of acoustics, water dynamics, and extreme patience.

**How It Works:**
1. Singer positions at a narrow point in the river
2. Produces specific frequencies that resonate with water molecules
3. The resonance increases water's erosive force against stone
4. Over years/decades, the effect becomes measurable
5. Over centuries, new channels form

**Why They Do It:**
- To help rivers find their natural paths
- To create safe passages for future generations
- As meditation (the practice requires focus, patience, presence)
- As art (the sounds themselves are beautiful)
- As worship (serving the water's will)

**Famous Examples:**
- **The Whispering Gorge:** Canyon carved over 300 years by seven generations of singers
- **The Three Sisters Rapids:** Once impassable; now navigable thanks to patient singing
- **The Singing Pools:** Natural amphitheaters where water echoes Canyon-Song back

**Current Crisis:**
Some singers report that the contaminated water doesn't resonate properly anymore. The frequencies are *off*. Attempting to Canyon-Sing with Wrong Water causes pain, disorientation, sometimes hemorrhaging from the sound-chambers.

### River-Reading (Dú-Shuǐ)

The practice of understanding what water "says":

**Temperature Reading:**
Minute changes in water temperature reveal:
- Approaching weather systems
- Underground spring locations
- Presence of warm-blooded creatures
- Seasonal shifts

**Flow Reading:**
Changes in current speed/direction reveal:
- Obstacles upstream (fallen trees, rockslides)
- Coming floods or droughts
- Presence of dams or diversions
- Underground channels opening/closing

**Chemical Reading:**
Tasting water chemistry reveals:
- Mineral content (what rocks the water passes through)
- Organic content (what lives in the water)
- Contamination (pollution, poisons, or... wrongness)
- Emotional residue (other En-He-Dao leave subtle traces)

**Pressure Reading:**
Sensing pressure changes reveals:
- Depth and volume
- Underground connections
- Coming storms (atmospheric pressure)
- Presence of large creatures

**Since the Passing:**
River-Reading has become unreliable. The Wrong Water carries signals that don't make sense—temperatures that shift impossibly, pressures that violate physics, tastes that register as simultaneously bitter and sweet, present and absent.

### The Journey-Marks

En-He-Dao mark significant river sites with carved stones placed underwater:

**Types of Marks:**

| Mark                 | Meaning                                                          |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Spiral**           | Safe passage                                                     |
| **Crossed Currents** | Dangerous—proceed carefully                                      |
| **Circle**           | Good fishing/hunting                                             |
| **Triangle**         | Sacred site—respect required                                     |
| **Wave Pattern**     | Cache location (supplies hidden nearby)                          |
| **Broken Line**      | Contaminated—avoid                                               |
| **Empty Circle**     | Memorial (someone died here)                                     |

Humans rarely see these—they're underwater, often deep. But other En-He-Dao can read them by touch even in darkness.

Since the Passing, "Broken Line" marks have multiplied exponentially.

### Language & Communication

**Spoken:**
- En-He-Dao speak a language descended from ancient Sino-Atargatan roots
- Also speak local human languages (necessity for trading)
- Complex grammar with multiple tense-systems based on flow-state
- Many words for different types of water movement (like Inuit words for snow)

**Underwater Communication:**
- Complex system of clicks, hums, and resonant tones
- Can communicate clearly underwater at significant distances
- Part of what makes Canyon-Singing possible

**Chemical Communication:**
- Leave scent-traces in water (pheromones, emotional markers)
- Other En-He-Dao can "read" who passed through and when
- Trace lingers for days in still water, hours in flowing water

**Color-Shifting:**
- Scales change with temperature and emotion
- Subtle language of mood and intent
- Experienced En-He-Dao read each other at a glance

### Art & Expression

| Form                   | Description                                                                            |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Flow-Dancing**       | Synchronized swimming; group performances in eddies and pools                          |
| **Current-Weaving**    | Creating intentional patterns in flowing water (ephemeral art)                         |
| **Stone-Carving**      | The Journey-Marks, but also personal art left in river-beds                            |
| **Song-Composition**   | New Canyon-Singing variations (takes decades to "finish" a song)                       |
| **Story-Flows**        | Oral tradition told while swimming (rhythm of movement shapes narrative)               |
| **Scale-Painting**     | Temporary dyes on scales; washes off, must be reapplied (impermanence as philosophy)  |

### Relationship to Death

**The Merging:**
When En-He-Dao die, they're returned to the river weighted with significant stones (from their birth-place, from sites they loved, from important journeys). The belief: consciousness dissolves into the water, becoming part of the eternal flow.

**Not Reincarnation:**
The dead don't come back as new people. They become the river itself—present in every drop, flowing through everything. Drinking river water is communing with ancestors. Swimming is embracing the dead.

**Memorial Practices:**
- Spiral-dances at death sites (water spiraling in eddies)
- Singing the deceased's favorite Canyon-Song
- Releasing a carved stone into the current (let it travel where it will)
- Speaking to the dead by speaking to the water

**No Fear of Death:**
Death is transformation, not ending. The flowing continues. Most En-He-Dao face death calmly, often swimming to their birth-river to die there (completing the cycle).

**Post-Passing Complication:**
Some En-He-Dao who died in the Passing didn't "merge" properly. Their consciousness seems trapped, fragmented, repeating the same swimming patterns endlessly. The survivors don't know if this is the contamination's effect or if the dead are trying to communicate something.

## 6. Relationship to Other Cultures

### The Atargatan Tradition

**Deep Alliance:**

The En-He-Dao are the most fervent practitioners of the Atargatan Way of Wu Wei:

**Shared Principles:**
- Flow and yielding
- Power without force
- Transformation through patience
- The eternal cycle

**Religious Practice:**
Most En-He-Dao are devout Atargatans, though they practice through *being* rather than ritual. Their entire life is worship—every swim is prayer, every journey is pilgrimage.

**Relationship with Surface-Kin (Shio-Gatis):**
Respectful trade partners and co-religionists. The Shio-Gatis (Tide-Changed people) occupy the coast-river boundary; En-He-Dao occupy the river-mountain boundary. They meet in river-mouths, trade knowledge, sometimes intermarry.

**Relationship with Deep-Kin (Ti-Abzu, Kur-Datsu):**
Distant but acknowledged kinship. Delta-Dwellers sometimes journey into the sea's edge and encounter the Deep-Kin. Both groups understand transformation through pressure/depth/flow. They exchange ritual knowledge and sometimes warnings (the Deep-Kin felt the Passing coming; they tried to warn the rivers, but the message wasn't understood in time).

### Humans

**Historical Relationship:**

**Ancient Times (Pre-Empire):**
- Humans feared river spirits; made offerings
- En-He-Dao were mediators between humans and water
- Mutual respect built on recognition of different natures

**Imperial Expansion:**
- Empire needed river-knowledge for trade/military
- En-He-Dao hired as guides (good pay, respected)
- Tensions over dams, diversions, pollution
- Some family-streams became wealthy; others refused human contact

**Church Era:**
- Suspicion of "serpent folk" (serpent = evil in Church iconography)
- Persecution less intense than for land-based peoples (harder to catch, no fixed homes)
- Some En-He-Dao converted nominally to access trading networks
- Most maintained Atargatan practice quietly

**Post-Passing:**
- Human desperation has led to severe river pollution
- Desperate communities dump refuse, corpses into rivers
- Some actively hunt En-He-Dao for meat (desperation-driven cannibalism)
- Other humans seek En-He-Dao help guiding refugee migrations
- Relationship strained to breaking

**Current Tensions:**

| Human Need          | En-He-Dao Response                            | Result             |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| River guidance      | "We guide if you respect the water"           | Sometimes works    |
| Fish harvest        | "Take what you need, but don't overharvest"   | Violations common  |
| Waste disposal      | "The river isn't your sewer"                  | Ignored, defied    |
| Dam building        | "This will kill the river"                    | Conflict, sabotage |

### The Uraeun (Snake-Kin Threshold-Keepers)

**Kinship and Difference:**

Both are serpentine peoples who practice threshold-related traditions, but:

**Uraeun:**
- Static, guarding specific thresholds
- Cold-blooded (need external warmth)
- Connected to ley-lines (Hettang)
- Transformative moments (shedding)

**En-He-Dao:**
- Constantly moving along rivers
- Temperature-regulating (can function in cold water)
- Connected to flow-lines (river currents)
- Continuous transformation (flowing)

**Relationship:**
Respectful but distant. They recognize each other as fellow "serpent-folk" but don't have deep cultural exchange. The Uraeun think the En-He-Dao are too restless; the En-He-Dao think the Uraeun are too static.

**Occasional Cooperation:**
When rivers cross ley-line thresholds, both groups maintain the site together. These threshold-river junctions are considered doubly sacred.

### The Dragon-Kin Hegemony

**Complex Relationship:**

The Dragon-Kin controlled southern rivers for millennia before the Empire. Relationship varies by house:

**Lóng-Imperiales (Admin/Military):**
- Attempted to "govern" rivers
- En-He-Dao resisted bureaucratic control
- Mutual frustration but grudging respect

**Tiān-Phanes (Philosophy/Science):**
- Fascinated by En-He-Dao Canyon-Singing
- Collaborated on acoustic research
- Some En-He-Dao studied with Tiān-Phanes scholars

**Mush-Nāga (Priesthood/Memory):**
- Recognized En-He-Dao as fellow ancient people
- Shared some Deep Fire knowledge (as Earth remembers, so does Water)
- Occasional spiritual exchanges

**Current Situation:**
Dragon-Kin have mostly withdrawn since the Passing. En-He-Dao who once traded with them now find abandoned river-posts. The southern rivers are less governed but also less protected.

### The Goleuwyr (Light-Children Elves)

**Minimal Contact:**

Goleuwyr rarely travel by river (prefer overland). En-He-Dao rarely visit elven settlements (too far from water). They acknowledge each other's existence, sometimes trade, but have little cultural exchange.

**Exception:** Some Delta-Dwelling En-He-Dao have relationships with coastal Goleuwyr communities. They bond over being long-lived peoples persecuted by the Church, but the fundamental difference in nature (Light vs. Water) limits deeper understanding.

### The Church

**Official Doctrine:**

En-He-Dao are "serpents"—inherently suspicious. Church teachings associate serpents with:
- Deception (the serpent in the garden)
- Paganism (water-spirits are "demons")
- Resistance to divine order (flowing = refusing to stay in place)

**Historical Persecution:**

Less severe than for settled peoples (harder to find, no fixed communities to burn) but still present:
- Arrests at trade-posts
- Accusations of river-poisoning during disease outbreaks
- "Holy water" dumped into rivers (sometimes actually poisonous to En-He-Dao)
- Destruction of sacred confluence sites

**Current Situation:**

The fractured Church has bigger problems. The Scouring occasionally hunts En-He-Dao, but most Church factions are too busy surviving to persecute river-dwellers actively.

**Some local priests** secretly maintain relationships with En-He-Dao, seeking river-knowledge to help their communities survive.

## 7. Key Figures

### Liú Měi-Yǔ (Beautiful-Rain) — Elder of the Golden Flow

**Branch:** Delta-Dweller
**Age:** ~340 years old
**Role:** Eldest living En-He-Dao; de facto spiritual leader (though she claims no authority); keeper of long memory
**Appearance:** Massive (17 feet), copper-bronze scales with age-dulled luster, wise eyes that have seen centuries flow past

**Character:**

Měi-Yǔ has lived through the Empire's entire rise and most of its decline. She was young when the Dragon-Kin ruled the rivers, middle-aged when humans came with their boats and demands, and ancient when the Church tried to "save" her soul. She's seen rivers dammed and then the dams collapse. She's seen cities rise on riverbanks and then be abandoned to floods. She understands, in her bones, that all things pass—even wrong things, eventually.

She is patient in a way that makes stone look hasty. She speaks rarely, and when she does, even the most impetuous Mountain-Born listen. She has guided her family-stream (one of the largest, ~40 members) through crises before—drought, flood, war, persecution. She believes they'll survive this too, though she's not certain what they'll become.

**The Complication:**

Měi-Yǔ is dying. Not from the contamination (she's old enough to resist it) but simply from age. En-He-Dao can live 400+ years, but she's approaching that limit. She's begun the "Deep Slowing"—the final stage where elders become less and less active, eventually stopping entirely before merging with the water.

What troubles her: she has knowledge no one else possesses. She remembers things from before the Empire, things about how the rivers used to be, things about sacred sites now forgotten. If she dies before teaching someone, that knowledge dies with her—or rather, merges with the water in a form no one can access.

She's trying to find a successor, someone with the patience and wisdom to receive her memory. But the younger En-He-Dao are too traumatized, too busy surviving, too changed by the Passing. She worries the continuity will break.

**Goal:** Pass on her knowledge before she merges; help her people survive the current crisis; understand what the Wrong Water actually *is* (she suspects something deeper than simple contamination).

**What She Knows:**
- Rivers have changed before (though never like this)
- There are sacred sites that predate the Empire, predate the Dragon-Kin, maybe predate humans
- Some rivers connect underground in ways the surface-dwellers don't know
- The Ivy (though she doesn't call it that—she calls it "the Unraveling") is spreading through the aquifer system

**Secret:**

In her youth, she traveled to the Deep Ocean and spoke with the Ti-Abzu. They told her something she's never shared: *"The ocean has roots, and those roots touch somewhere that isn't anywhere. When we listen at the vents, we sometimes hear absence singing. The silence has a name we've all forgotten."*

She didn't understand it then. She's beginning to now. She suspects the contamination isn't *in* the water—it's coming *through* the water from somewhere else. Somewhere underneath.

---

### Shān Kuài-Liú (Fast-Stream) — Mountain-Born Scout

**Branch:** Mountain-Born
**Age:** ~85 years old
**Role:** Scout and messenger; fastest swimmer of his generation; boundary-pusher
**Appearance:** Sleek, silver-scaled, perpetually moving even when "resting," intense blue eyes

**Character:**

Kuài-Liú embodies Mountain-Born nature: fast, intense, impatient, direct. He's completed his river's full journey (headwaters to delta and back) more times than anyone his age—he can't stay still. Other En-He-Dao joke that he's trying to swim fast enough to catch up to himself.

Before the Passing, this restlessness made him valuable—he'd scout ahead, carry messages between family-streams, investigate reports of river damage. He was the first to see many things: new dams, polluted stretches, dangerous rapids. He'd race back to warn his family-stream, often arriving just in time to prevent disaster.

After the Passing, his talent became a curse. He was upstream when it happened. He felt the Wrong Water coming and tried to outrun it, swimming downstream faster than he'd ever swum. He couldn't outrun it. It swept over him, through him, and he experienced something he can't articulate—a sensation of being *dissolved* while remaining whole, of being everywhere and nowhere simultaneously.

He survived, but he's changed. He can't stop moving now—if he tries to rest for more than a few hours, he begins to feel that dissolution sensation again. He has to swim constantly, has to keep moving, or he'll... what? He doesn't know. He's terrified to find out.

**The Complication:**

Kuài-Liú has discovered something in the deep mountain pools, in the secret sources where rivers begin: the water there isn't *beginning* anymore. It's *arriving* from somewhere else. Not from rain or snowmelt—from beneath, seeping up through cracks in the bedrock. And this water is *wrong* in a different way than the Wrong Rain. It's pre-wrong, un-wrong—it's water that hasn't decided whether to be water yet.

He's seen dark fibrous growth spreading through the deep-source caves. He's watched headwaters that fed rivers for millennia simply *stop* flowing as the growth consumed them. He's tried to warn others, but he's moving too fast, talking too intensely, and he sounds mad.

**Goal:** Map every source of contamination; find where it's actually coming from; convince others that the threat is worse than they think; figure out how to stop moving without dissolving.

**What He Knows:**
- The contamination has multiple sources (Wrong Rain from above, Unraveling from below)
- Some rivers have gone completely silent (no flow at all)
- There are caves in the mountains where reality is *thin*—where something else is pressing through
- He's seen things in those caves that he can't describe because he doesn't have words for them

**Secret:**

In one of those thin-reality caves, he found a pool that was perfectly still—no current, no temperature, no *anything*. When he looked into it, he saw his own reflection, but his reflection wasn't moving. His reflection was *stopped*, frozen in place, and it looked... peaceful. Terrifyingly peaceful.

He's convinced that if he stops moving, he'll become like that reflection—stuck, unable to flow, trapped in the moment. He's right, but not in the way he thinks. The pool was showing him what happens if the Null Field fully crystallizes: everything becomes undefined, all movement stops, all categories cease to apply.

### Hé Jìng-Liú (Calm-Stream) — Valley-Folk Negotiator

**Branch:** Valley-Folk
**Age:** ~145 years old
**Role:** Primary negotiator between En-He-Dao and humans; trader, diplomat, crisis-mediator
**Appearance:** Medium build (14 feet), deep blue-green scales, expressive face (for a serpent), gentle eyes that hide calculating intelligence

**Character:**

Jìng-Liú is a rarity among post-Passing En-He-Dao: she still believes cooperation with humans is possible. Not because she's naive—she knows human history, knows about the Church's persecution, knows how desperate humans can be cruel. But she believes that survival requires adaptation, and adaptation requires dialogue.

She's spent her adult life building relationships with human communities along her family's river. She knows traders by name, attends (discreetly) village harvest festivals, has even stood as sponsor for human children who wanted to honor the river. She speaks six human languages fluently. She can negotiate trade deals, mediate water-rights disputes, and find creative solutions to seemingly impossible problems.

Before the Passing, she was respected by both En-He-Dao and humans—a bridge-builder, a peace-keeper. After the Passing, she's become controversial. Her own people are split: some see her human-friendliness as naiveté, others as betrayal. Humans are split too: some still trust her, others see her as just another monster to exploit.

**The Complication:**

Jìng-Liú is trying to negotiate what she calls "The Water Covenant"—a formal agreement between En-He-Dao family-streams and human riverside communities. The terms:
- Humans stop dumping waste in rivers
- Humans allow controlled fish harvests only
- Humans don't dam without En-He-Dao consultation
- In exchange: En-He-Dao guide boats, warn of floods, help with river management

Sounds simple. It's not.

**Problems:**
- Human communities are desperate; they can't always keep promises
- En-He-Dao are traumatized; they don't trust promises anymore
- The contamination makes some terms impossible (fish are dying; harvesting is pointless)
- Other En-He-Dao see her as collaborating with the enemy
- Some humans see the Covenant as surrender to "river-snakes"

She's caught between worlds, trying to save both, satisfying neither.

**Goal:** Get the Water Covenant accepted by at least one major human settlement and one family-stream (proof of concept); prevent further river degradation; find a way for humans and En-He-Dao to survive together.

**What She Knows:**
- Human desperation is real (they're not being cruel for fun)
- En-He-Dao trauma is real (they're not being stubborn for fun)
- The contamination will kill both groups if they don't cooperate
- Some humans are genuinely trying to help
- Some En-He-Dao will never trust humans again (and maybe they're right)

**Secret:**

She's been meeting secretly with a Monastic scholar (Brother Aldric, specializes in pre-Church water traditions) who's been researching old texts about river-spirits. He's found references to "the Nine Wells" that feed all rivers, and hints that one of those wells has been "closed" for so long that everyone forgot it existed. He thinks opening it might cleanse the rivers. She thinks it's worth investigating, but if her people find out she's consorting with a Church member, they'll exile her—and her family-stream might die without her negotiating skills.

## 8. Post-Passing Situation

### The Contamination Crisis

**Wrong Rain (Cuò-Yǔ):**

After the Passing, rain fell differently. The Atargatan peoples call it "Wrong Rain"—precipitation that carries contamination from the Eldritch creatures' passage through the atmosphere. This rain entered rivers, and rivers entered the En-He-Dao.

**Effects on Water:**
- Temperature instabilities (ice-cold patches in warm rivers)
- Chemical inconsistencies (tastes bitter and sweet simultaneously)
- Flow disruptions (currents that shouldn't exist)
- Spiritual wrongness (water that doesn't feel like water anymore)

**Effects on En-He-Dao:**
- Immediate: Some died from shock (sensitive organs overwhelmed)
- Short-term: Disorientation, inability to River-Read, pain during swimming
- Long-term: Chronic illness, sterility, behavioral changes
- Ongoing: Can't Canyon-Sing properly (the resonance is wrong)

**Current Spread:**
- All major rivers contaminated to some degree
- Mountain sources less affected (haven't received as much Wrong Rain yet)
- Delta regions worst (concentrated contamination)
- Underground aquifers... uncertain (no one's checked thoroughly)

### The Unraveling (Jiě-Sàn)

Beneath the Wrong Rain contamination, something else is spreading—something the Underground-Swimmers discovered first.

**What They've Seen:**
- Dark fibrous growth in aquifer systems
- Water that "forgets" how to be water
- Dissolution of stone, not through erosion but through... un-becoming
- Connections between aquifers that shouldn't exist

**What the Surface Doesn't Know Yet:**
- The Ivy is spreading through underground water-veins
- It's moving faster than surface contamination
- It's not just pollution—it's something that *unpollutes* by unmaking the concept of pollution
- Some rivers will simply stop existing

**The Underground-Swimmers' Warning:**

Dì-Xià-Liú family-streams have tried to warn the surface: *"The deep waters are forgetting themselves. What rises to feed your rivers will not be water. It will be the space where water used to be. When that reaches the surface, when rivers become not-rivers, we will all dissolve into the question of what we were."*

Most En-He-Dao think this is poetic metaphor. It's not.

### The Response Factions

#### The Flow-Keepers (Liú-Shǒu) — ~40% of En-He-Dao

**Position:** "Continue the Journey. Adapt. Rivers have changed before."

**Led by:** Měi-Yǔ and other Elders

**Arguments:**
- Stopping movement means death (it's antithetical to En-He-Dao nature)
- Adaptation is survival
- The contamination will eventually flow out to sea and dissipate
- New routes can be found around worst-affected areas

**Weaknesses:**
- Contamination isn't flowing out—it's spreading
- "New routes" are increasingly limited
- Some family-streams following this path have gone missing
- The Unraveling doesn't care about adaptation

---

#### The Source-Seekers (Yuán-Xún) — ~35% of En-He-Dao

**Position:** "Find where contamination originates. Stop it at the source."

**Led by:** Kuài-Liú and other Mountain-Born

**Arguments:**
- Treating symptoms won't solve the problem
- The contamination has a source; it can be found
- Once found, it can be sealed, cleansed, or destroyed
- Waiting is slower death than action

**Weaknesses:**
- Multiple sources (Wrong Rain from sky, Unraveling from deep)
- "Sealing" or "cleansing" may be impossible
- Searching actively exposes them to more contamination
- What if the source is something they can't fight?

---

#### The Covenant-Builders (Qì-Yuē) — ~15% of En-He-Dao

**Position:** "Cooperate with humans. Shared crisis requires shared solution."

**Led by:** Jìng-Liú and other Valley-Folk

**Arguments:**
- Humans control the land; rivers pass through the land
- Human knowledge and resources could help
- Isolation hasn't protected anyone
- Building bridges is better than burning them

**Weaknesses:**
- Humans have broken promises before
- Many humans are too desperate to be reliable
- Cooperation might just get En-He-Dao exploited
- Other En-He-Dao see this as betrayal

---

#### The Deep-Divers (Shēn-Qián) — ~10% of En-He-Dao

**Position:** "Go deeper. Hide in aquifers until surface crisis passes."

**Led by:** Underground-Swimmer elders

**Arguments:**
- Surface is too dangerous now
- Deep aquifers still relatively clean
- Can wait out the crisis underground
- Preservation of the species is paramount

**Weaknesses:**
- The Unraveling is *in* the deep places
- The Underground-Swimmers know this but haven't told everyone
- "Waiting it out" assumes the crisis is temporary
- No food sources in deep aquifers (can't sustain population)

## 9. Secrets & Mysteries

### The Nine Wells

Měi-Yǔ's memory and Brother Aldric's research point to the same thing: ancient texts mention "Nine Wells" that feed all rivers. Eight are known (major watershed sources). One is forgotten.

**What No One Knows:**
The ninth well is the connection point between the Water realm and the Abyss. It's the source that Katiari created when she established the Hawthorne—a hidden spring that flows from the void itself. It's been sealed by forgetting for millennia.

**What This Means:**
If found and opened, it could either:
- Cleanse all rivers (flowing pure water from before contamination)
- Or destroy all rivers (flowing void-water that unmaking everything)

**The Risk:**
Opening it requires remembering what's been forgotten. That could crack open the erasure protecting Katiari. The rivers might be saved, but at what cost to the larger cosmological balance?

### The Dissolved

Some En-He-Dao who died in the Passing didn't merge with the water properly. Their consciousness fragmented, and now they're... something else. Not dead, not alive, not quite anything.

**What Survivors Have Seen:**
- Shapes in the water that look like En-He-Dao but aren't solid
- Voices calling from rapids that sound familiar but speak no language
- Eddies that form spiral patterns matching deceased family-members' swimming styles
- Touch that feels like memory made physical

**What It Actually Is:**
The contamination disrupted the En-He-Dao's merging process. Instead of dissolving into the river completely, parts of their consciousness got caught in loops—repeating patterns, unable to complete the transformation.

**They're trying to communicate something.** The repeating patterns aren't random. They're warning about what's coming through the deep places. But the message is fragmented, spread across hundreds of miles of river, expressed in a medium (pure flow-state consciousness) that the living can barely perceive.

### The River-Heart

Deep in the Kur-Datsu territory (pressure-adapted peoples in the ocean trenches), there's a place called the River-Heart—where all rivers meet the sea, metaphorically speaking. It's not a physical location but a spiritual one: the conceptual point where fresh becomes salt, where journey ends and begins again.

**What the Delta-Dwellers Know:**
The River-Heart is accessible through deep meditation at the moment of tide-turn in major estuaries. You feel your consciousness spread through the entire water-cycle: from rain to river to sea to evaporation to cloud to rain again. It's transcendent, overwhelming, usually brief.

**What's Changed:**
Since the Passing, En-He-Dao who reach the River-Heart report encountering something else there—an absence-presence, a voice that isn't speaking, a current that flows backward through time. They emerge from the meditation confused, sometimes changed.

**What It Is:**
The River-Heart is touching the edge of Katiari's realm. The Abyss underlies all things, and in moments of transition (fresh-to-salt, high-to-low tide), the boundary thins. The "voice" is hope trying to reach through the forgetting, trying to warn about the Ivy, trying to ask for help.

But the message is wrapped in absence. It arrives as questions with no words: *"Who forgot? What's dissolving? Where does water go when it forgets it's water?"*

## 10. Relationships with Major Factions

### Religious Factions

| Faction                 | Relationship                                                      |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Solarian Church**     | Hostile (serpent symbolism makes them suspicious)                 |
| **The Scouring**        | Actively hunting (easy targets at trade-posts)                    |
| **The Flagellants**     | Indifferent (consumed by their own suffering)                     |
| **The Monastics**       | Secretly sympathetic (some study water-traditions)                |
| **The Academics**       | Fascinated (want to study Canyon-Singing, River-Reading)          |
| **Atargatan Tradition** | Deeply allied (En-He-Dao are living embodiment of Wu Wei)         |
| **Ostaran Tradition**   | Respectful (both understand death as transformation)              |
| **Revnan Tradition**    | Neutral (different realms, minimal overlap)                       |
| **Axis Faith**          | Trading partners (need different resources, respect each other)   |
| **Alysian Folk**        | Allied (both persecuted, both tied to natural world)              |

### Political Factions

## 11. Adventure Hooks

### 1. The Silent River

**Setup:**

The Bronwyn River (named ironically—it flows through deep forest, barely sees light) has gone silent. No flow. No sound. No movement. The En-He-Dao family-stream that navigates it (the Silver-Current) sent scouts upstream to investigate. None returned.

Now a delegation has arrived at the nearest human settlement (Willowmere, on the forest edge) asking for help. They need land-walkers who can investigate the headwaters without needing to swim. The village is desperate enough to send someone—if the river dies completely, their water source dies with it.

**The Question:**

What stopped the Bronwyn River? Where are the missing scouts? Can it be fixed?

**Complications:**
- The river's source is deep in the Kingswood (Forest Kin territory)
- The Forest Kin are not welcoming outsiders right now
- The headwaters are in a cave system
- Inside the cave: dark fibrous growth consuming the spring (the Ivy)
- The missing scouts are there, but they've been... changed (partially dissolved by contact with the Ivy)
- Destroying the growth might kill the scouts
- Not destroying it will kill the river
- Oh, and the cave is one of those "thin" places where the Abyss is pressing through

**Player Involvement:**
- Negotiating with both En-He-Dao and Forest Kin
- Investigating the cave system
- Deciding what to do about the scouts (mercy kill? Attempt rescue? Leave them?)
- Possibly encountering what's behind the Ivy
- Returning with news that will terrify everyone

---

### 2. The Water Covenant

**Setup:**

Jìng-Liú has convinced her family-stream to attempt a formal Water Covenant with the human settlement of Riverside (population ~800, on the Heartflood River). The village council has agreed to negotiate. A meeting is scheduled at the confluence of two rivers—neutral ground, sacred to both groups.

The players are hired as neutral mediators. Both sides trust them (enough). Their job: facilitate the meeting, prevent violence, help find compromises.

**The Question:**

Can a lasting agreement be reached? And even if it can, will both sides honor it?

**Complications:**
- Hardliners on both sides oppose the meeting (En-He-Dao who hate humans, humans who fear "river-snakes")
- The Scouring has learned about the meeting and plans to attack (purge the serpents)
- During negotiations, word arrives: a nearby village upstream has dumped bodies into the river (plague dead)
- The contamination will reach the confluence in hours
- Riverside claims it wasn't them (true—it was the *other* village)
- En-He-Dao accuse Riverside of breaking faith before the agreement is even signed
- Someone has to swim upstream into contaminated water to verify the truth
- The Scouring arrives mid-crisis

**Player Involvement:**
- Mediating increasingly tense negotiations
- Investigating the body-dumping
- Defending against Scouring attack (fight or talk down?)
- Swimming into contaminated water (if no En-He-Dao can/will)
- Saving the Covenant (or watching it collapse and dealing with aftermath)

---

### 3. The Mountain Source

**Setup:**

Kuài-Liú arrives at the players' location, half-mad with exhaustion and terror. He's been swimming non-stop for six days. He's seen something in the deep mountain sources, and he needs help. He can't convince other En-He-Dao—they think he's contamination-mad—so he's asking land-walkers.

He'll guide them to the Highest Spring—the source of the River King, the longest river in the northern territories. He claims something is coming through there, something that's not water, and if it reaches the main channel, the entire river system will die.

**The Question:**

Is Kuài-Liú right? What's at the Highest Spring? Can it be stopped?

**Complications:**
- Getting there requires mountaineering (dangerous)
- The area is sacred to both Forest Kin and Urkhani (neither group welcomes intrusion)
- Kuài-Liú is *not* exaggerating—there's a cave where reality is thin
- Inside: a pool of not-water that's spreading
- It's a manifestation of the Null Field trying to crystallize (undefined water, water that can't decide if it exists)
- Touching it causes temporary ego-death (you forget who/what you are)
- It's spreading slowly but inexorably
- "Stopping" it requires... what? Fighting nothing? Defining the undefined?
- Wait—there's something *in* the pool. A reflection that isn't a reflection. It's trying to communicate.

**Player Involvement:**
- Escorting Kuài-Liú (keeping him alive/sane)
- Navigating mountain dangers
- Negotiating with territorial Forest Kin/Urkhani
- Confronting the reality-thin cave
- Possibly making contact with what's in the pool (Katiari's realm, tangentially)
- Finding a solution to undefined water
- Dealing with Kuài-Liú's breakdown (what happens if he stops moving?)

### 4. The Disappeared

**Setup:**

Two family-streams (the Deep-Current and the Stone-Singers, ~30 En-He-Dao total) vanished six months ago. They were supposed to appear at the Autumn Gathering. They didn't. Scouts found their last-known location (a stretch of the Underground River in the southern territories) but couldn't follow further—the passages go too deep.

Měi-Yǔ has called for volunteers to investigate. She's offering significant rewards (knowledge, favors, access to secret sites). But she won't send En-He-Dao—they're too vulnerable to contamination, and she can't risk more losses. She needs land-walkers who can navigate underground without needing water.

**The Question:**

What happened to the Disappeared? Are they alive? Can they be rescued?

**Complications:**
- The Underground River goes deep—into Kur-Datsu territory (pressure-adapted peoples)
- The Kur-Datsu are hostile to surface-dwellers
- The passages are flooded, requiring underwater navigation (or magic, or creative problem-solving)
- The Disappeared are alive but trapped
- They found something—a cavern where the Ivy is growing thick, a place where rivers connect to the Abyss
- They've been there for six months, drinking nothing but Abyss-tinged water
- They've changed (not quite dissolved, but... undefined)
- They've learned something about Katiari (they don't have the name, but they've touched her realm)
- Bringing them back might spread what they've touched
- Leaving them means they'll eventually dissolve completely

**Player Involvement:**
- Cave-diving into dangerous depths
- Negotiating with hostile Kur-Datsu
- Finding the Disappeared
- Deciding what to do with them (rescue? Mercy kill? Study?)
- Possibly encountering the Ivy directly
- Returning with knowledge that changes everything

### 5. The Nine Wells

**Setup:**

Měi-Yǔ and Brother Aldric have pieced together enough information about the Nine Wells to attempt finding the ninth. They need a diverse team: En-He-Dao who can navigate water, land-walkers who can access places rivers can't reach, someone with knowledge of the Abyss (if such person exists), and someone brave/foolish enough to try opening a forgotten source.

The ninth well is hidden beneath the oldest ruins in the Empire—a pre-human city that was already ancient when the Goleuwyr arrived. No one knows what's down there. The ruins have a reputation: people who enter don't come back.

**The Question:**

Can the ninth well be found? Should it be opened? What will flow from it?

**Complications:**
- The ruins are dangerous (collapsing structures, ancient traps, spirits of the very-long-dead)
- The well is guarded (by what? By forgetting itself—you forget you're searching)
- Opening it requires sacrifice (not necessarily death, but *something*—memory? Identity? Hope?)
- When opened, the well flows both ways: it brings water up, but it also pulls something down
- What flows from it is pure—water from before contamination, before the Passing, maybe before creation itself
- But it's also void-water—water from the Abyss, water that remembers Katiari
- It spreads through the river system rapidly
- Some rivers are cleansed
- Others become undefined
- The En-He-Dao who drink it experience temporary dissolution (they become the water, literally)
- And something else comes through: a message, wrapped in hope, speaking in questions

**Player Involvement:**
- Exploring deadly ruins
- Solving the puzzle of the well's location
- Deciding whether to open it (and who pays the sacrifice)
- Managing the consequences (rivers cleansing and/or dissolving)
- Possibly making first contact with Katiari's realm (if campaign is ready)
- Dealing with faction responses (some celebrate, some rage)

## 13. Current State & Future Direction

### Population Estimates

| Category                      | Number      |
| ----------------------------- | ----------- |
| **Pre-Passing Total**         | ~15,000     |

| **Underground-Swimmers**      | ~1,000      |

### The Tipping Point

The En-He-Dao face multiple existential threats converging:

**Immediate Crisis:**
- Contaminated rivers (Wrong Rain spreading)
- Human desperation (pollution, overfishing, violence)
- Population collapse (low birth rates, high death rates)

**Medium-Term Crisis:**
- Family-stream fragmentation (can't complete journeys, losing cohesion)
- Knowledge loss (elders dying before passing on wisdom)
- Spiritual crisis (can't practice traditions properly)

**Long-Term Crisis:**
- The Unraveling (Ivy spreading through aquifer systems)
- River death (some rivers have stopped flowing entirely)
- Identity dissolution (if you can't flow, are you still En-He-Dao?)

### Possible Futures

#### Scenario A: Adaptation
- Find new routes around contaminated areas
- Develop resistance to Wrong Water
- Partner with humans for mutual survival
- Slow recovery over generations

**Likelihood:** Low (contamination spreading faster than adaptation)

---

#### Scenario B: The Deep Dive
- Retreat to underground aquifers
- Become primarily cave-dwellers (like Underground-Swimmers)
- Sacrifice surface existence for survival
- Slow transformation into different people

**Likelihood:** Moderate (desperate option, but survivable)

---

#### Scenario C: The Covenant
- Successful Water Covenant with multiple human settlements
- Coordinated clean-up efforts
- Shared river management
- Fragile but functional coexistence

**Likelihood:** Low (requires too much trust from too many parties)

---

#### Scenario D: Extinction
- Contamination kills remaining population
- Family-streams dissolve one by one
- Knowledge lost, culture forgotten
- Maybe some En-He-Dao survive in isolation, but not as a people

**Likelihood:** Moderate-High (current trajectory without intervention)

---

#### Scenario E: Transformation
- Contact with the Abyss changes them fundamentally
- They become something neither alive nor dead
- Fully merge with the water-cycle (achieve what they've always aspired to)
- Stop being individuals, become the flow itself

**Likelihood:** Unknown (depends on Katiari arc resolution)

---

### The Deeper Truth

Beneath all these scenarios lies a reality the En-He-Dao don't yet understand:

**The rivers are failing because the water-cycle itself is compromised.**

- Wrong Rain from above (Eldritch contamination)
- Unraveling from below (Ivy dissolving structure)
- The cycle that connects them (evaporation, cloud, rain, river, sea) is breaking

If the cycle breaks completely, water stops being water. Not polluted—undefined. The En-He-Dao, who are *of* water more than any other people, would be the first to dissolve into that undefined state.

But they're also potentially the key to fixing it. Their Canyon-Singing shapes water's behavior. Their River-Reading understands water's nature. Their entire culture is built on flow-as-identity.

If anyone can repair a broken water-cycle, if anyone can find and open the ninth well, if anyone can reach through the Abyss to ask for help—it's the En-He-Dao.

They just need to survive long enough to try.

## 14. Using En-He-Dao in Your Campaign

### As NPCs

**Encounter Roles:**
- **River Guides:** Navigating boats through dangerous waters
- **Mysterious Scouts:** Appearing suddenly with warnings, disappearing just as fast
- **Desperate Refugees:** Fleeing contaminated rivers, asking for sanctuary
- **Tragic Figures:** Slowly dying from contamination they can't escape
- **Mediators:** Negotiating water-rights between upstream and downstream communities
- **Oracles:** Sensing future floods, droughts, disasters through River-Reading

### As Player Characters

**Class Considerations:**
- Monks (Flow-State practices, Wu Wei philosophy)
- Druids (water-focused, transformation themes)
- Rangers (environment-specific, guide/scout roles)
- Bards (Canyon-Singing as performance magic)
- Clerics (Atargatan tradition, flow-as-worship)

**Mechanical Considerations:**
- Swim speed equal to walk speed
- Can breathe underwater (gills)
- Advantage on water-based skill checks
- Disadvantage on land-based athletics (no legs)
- Must be near water sources regularly or suffer exhaustion
- Sensitive to water contamination (Constitution checks)

**Story Considerations:**
- Why did they leave their family-stream?
- What's their stance on human cooperation?
- How do they handle the contamination?
- What's their relationship to the Journey philosophy?
- Do they know Canyon-Singing?

### As a Campaign Focus

**Possible Campaign Arcs:**

1. **The Water Covenant:** Building lasting peace between species
2. **The Source Hunt:** Finding and stopping the contamination's origin
3. **The Nine Wells:** Legendary quest to cleanse all rivers
4. **The Deep Dive:** Exploring underground aquifer systems
5. **The Dissolution:** Horror campaign about losing identity/definition

### Tone & Atmosphere

**En-He-Dao Stories Should Feel:**
- Fluid and adaptable (nothing is fixed)
- Philosophical but grounded (abstract ideas with physical consequences)
- Beautiful and melancholic (the journey continues, but at what cost?)
- Connected (everything flows to everything else)
- Patient but urgent (slow wisdom meeting fast crisis)

**They Should Not Feel:**
- Generic "peaceful water-people"
- Noble savage stereotypes
- Weak or passive (Wu Wei is not passivity)
- Disconnected from material stakes
- Mystical-wise-but-useless
