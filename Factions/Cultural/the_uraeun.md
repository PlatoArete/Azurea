**Summary:**

The Uraeun are serpent-people—cold-blooded, lidless-eyed, tongues flickering to taste the air. But they are not defined by their biology. They are defined by their sacred duty: they are threshold-keepers, guardians of the *Hersai*—the Between-State.

Every doorway, every dawn, every river-mouth where fresh water meets salt, every cave entrance, every birth and death—these are thresholds. Places where one thing becomes another. Spaces of transformation. The Uraeun tend them.

This is not metaphor. Thresholds are real, tangible things in the metaphysics of Azurea. They are places where realm-fields touch, where energy flows, where reality is thin and transformation is possible. Someone must watch them. Someone must maintain them. Someone must ensure they remain open for legitimate passage and closed to illegitimate intrusion.

For millennia, the Uraeun have served as these watchers. They station themselves—individually or in pairs—at significant thresholds across the continent. They perform daily rituals of maintenance. They sing through the *Hettang* (ley-lines) to communicate across vast distances. They shed their skin in sacred ceremonies of renewal. They are hidden, patient, essential.

The Solarian Church calls them serpents, deceivers, servants of darkness. This is projection—the Church fears what it doesn't understand. The Uraeun worship neither Light nor Dark exclusively. They worship the *space between*—the threshold itself, the moment of transformation, the boundary where all possibility exists.

The Passing damaged the ley-lines. The Hettang—the network of spiritual connections the Uraeun maintain—has been disrupted. For the first time in recorded history, the threshold-keepers are struggling. Some thresholds have closed. Some have opened too wide. Some have... changed into something wrong.

The Uraeun are working desperately to repair the Net of the Between. But they need help. They need allies who understand that boundaries aren't walls—they're living, breathing places that connect as much as they separate.

## The Nature of the Uraeun

### Physical Characteristics

The Uraeun are serpent-people with varying degrees of serpentine features:

**Minimal Expression (Semi-Serpentine):**
- Human body with scaled skin
- Serpent head (or human head with scaled face)
- Forked tongue, lidless eyes
- Internal temperature regulation (cold-blooded)

**Moderate Expression:**
- Serpentine lower body (like naga/lamia)
- Human upper body with scales
- Highly flexible spine
- Retractable fangs (some venomous, some not)

**Maximum Expression:**
- Nearly full serpent form
- Human-like arms or no arms
- Can move as humans do (coiled vertical) or as snakes
- Complete serpentine sensory system

**Common Features Across All:**
- **Lidless Eyes:** They don't blink; they see constantly
- **Forked Tongue:** Primary sense organ (smell/taste combined)
- **Scales:** Varying patterns and colors
- **Cold-Blooded:** Require external heat sources
- **Shedding:** Periodic molting (significant ritual event)

**Physical Capabilities:**
- **Ground Vibration Sense:** Can "hear" through bone conduction of vibrations
- **Heat-Sensing (Some):** Pit organs detecting temperature differences
- **Flexibility:** Joints more flexible than human standard
- **Venom (Some):** Not all Uraeun are venomous; those who are keep it secret

### The Hettang (Ley-Line Sense)

The defining Uraeun ability: they can sense and interact with ley-lines.

**What Are Ley-Lines?**
- Energy channels connecting thresholds across the world
- Not visible to most people
- Carry information, emotion, and power
- Natural geography of the Between-State

**What Uraeun Can Do:**
- **Sense:** Feel ley-lines like humans feel wind
- **Navigate:** Follow them like roads
- **Communicate:** Send messages through them (Hettang-Singing)
- **Draw Power:** Access threshold-energy for ritual work
- **Monitor:** Detect blockages, damage, or intrusion
- **Repair:** Skilled Uraeun can mend damaged lines

**The Hettang Sense:**
Not all Uraeun have equal sensitivity. Some are naturally gifted; others train for decades. The most sensitive can:
- Feel emotions transmitted through lines
- Sense distant events at other thresholds
- Navigate by ley-line topology (never lost)
- Detect lies (disruption in personal ley-field)

**Limitations:**
- The Passing damaged many ley-lines (some silent now)
- Noise can obscure signals
- Distance reduces clarity
- Strong emotions can overwhelm sensitive Uraeun

### Cold-Blooded Nature (Threshold-Basking)

The Uraeun are ectothermic—they don't generate body heat internally.

**Practical Implications:**
- Must bask in sun or near heat sources
- Sluggish in cold (can become torpid)
- Active in warmth (energetic, quick)
- Require planning around temperature

**Threshold-Basking (Sacred Practice):**
Uraeun don't just bask anywhere—they bask *at thresholds*:
- Doorways catching morning/evening sun
- Cave mouths at dawn/dusk
- River-banks where water temperature changes
- Anywhere one temperature zone meets another

**Why This Is Sacred:**
Basking at thresholds means absorbing both physical warmth AND threshold-energy. It's meditation, worship, and biological necessity combined. An Uraeun basking at a doorway is:
- Warming themselves (biological)
- Absorbing Hersai-energy (spiritual)
- Monitoring the threshold (practical)
- Performing devotion (religious)

**Social Implications:**
Other peoples sometimes don't understand why Uraeun are found draped across doorways, lying on bridge-edges, or coiled on riverbanks at specific times. It looks lazy. It's actually sacred duty.

### The Wehsae (Sacred Shedding)

All serpents shed skin. For Uraeun, this is profound ritual.

**Frequency:**
- Young Uraeun: 3-4 times per year
- Adult Uraeun: 1-2 times per year
- Elder Uraeun: Annually or less

**The Process:**
1. **The Dulling:** Skin becomes cloudy, vision obscured (days of withdrawal)
2. **The Loosening:** Skin separates from new layer underneath (itchy, uncomfortable)
3. **The Release:** Actual shedding (takes hours; vulnerable state)
4. **The Renewal:** Emergence in new skin (colors brighter, senses sharper)

**Ritual Significance:**

**Physical:** Literal transformation—old skin off, new skin revealed
**Spiritual:** Release of accumulated spiritual "weight"
**Psychological:** Opportunity to shed old identity, embrace change
**Social:** Marks transition between life stages

**The Wehsae Ceremony:**
Not just biological shedding but ritual transformation:
- **Preparation:** Fast, meditation, threshold-dwelling
- **Witnesses:** Close kin attend if possible
- **Offerings:** Possessions given away (you shed more than skin)
- **The Shedding:** Done at sacred threshold
- **Celebration:** Emergence is joyous (you are renewed)
- **The Old Skin:** Burned, buried, or given to threshold (never kept)

**What's Shed:**
- Literal skin (obviously)
- Old names (Uraeun sometimes change names after Wehsae)
- Grudges and debts (ritual forgiveness)
- Possessions (give things away before shedding)
- Old roles (you can emerge as new person)

**Cultural Parallel:**
Think of shedding as combination of molting, New Year's resolutions, bankruptcy discharge, and religious rebirth. It's *that* significant.

## Culture and Society

### The Sacred Threshold (Hersai)

**Core Belief:** The threshold—the between-space—is the most sacred part of reality.

**What Counts as Threshold:**

**Physical Thresholds:**
- Doorways, gates, arches
- Cave mouths, tunnel entrances
- Bridges (land/water, shore/shore)
- Riverbanks (especially where rivers meet)
- Coastlines (land/sea)
- Mountain passes
- Forest edges

**Temporal Thresholds:**
- Dawn and dusk (day/night)
- Equinoxes and solstices (season/season)
- Midnight (day/day)
- The moment between heartbeats

**Biological Thresholds:**
- Birth (non-life/life)
- Death (life/non-life)
- Puberty (child/adult)
- Orgasm (self/other)
- Waking and sleeping (conscious/unconscious)

**Metaphysical Thresholds:**
- Where realm-fields meet (Light/Dark boundary, etc.)
- Ley-line intersections
- Places where Fae realm touches mortal
- Anywhere the veil is thin

### The Five Principles

**1. Transformation as Devotion:**
Change is holy. Resisting transformation is resisting the sacred. The Wehsae (shedding) is highest sacrament.

**2. The Threshold Creates:**
Nothing new comes from stability. Only at boundaries—where things meet—does creation happen. The threshold is where possibility becomes reality.

**3. Binding and Joining:**
Thresholds don't separate; they connect. A door joins inside and outside. A river-mouth joins land and sea. The Uraeun role is to maintain connection, not enforce separation.

**4. Hidden Nourishment:**
The most important things happen unseen. Seeds grow underground. Babies grow in wombs. The Uraeun's work is invisible but essential.

**5. Renewal Through Release:**
You must let go to receive. Shed old skin to have new. Release the past to embrace future. The Wehsae embodies this.

### Sacred Geometry

**The Coil (Mehgam):**
The spiral—symbol of protection, containment, and return. 

**Meanings:**
- Protection: coiled around what you guard
- Journey: spiral path always leads inward/outward
- Containment: holding without crushing
- Return: you come back to where you began, but changed

**Uses:**
- Meditative practice (walking spirals)
- Architectural element (buildings with spiral layouts)
- Defensive posture (literally coiling around threshold)
- Art motif (constant in Uraeun work)

**The Line (Hettang):**
The ley-line—symbol of connection, communication, and flow.

**Meanings:**
- Connection: linking distant points
- Communication: information flows along lines
- Energy: power travels through network
- Balance: flow in both directions

**Uses:**
- Navigation (follow the lines)
- Communication (sing through lines)
- Ritual (channel power along lines)
- Mapping (topology of sacred geography)

**The Threshold-Mark (Hersai-Glyph):**
A specific pattern marking sacred thresholds:
- Looks like two spirals joined by a line
- Left spiral = origin
- Right spiral = destination  
- Line = the crossing between

**Function:**
- Identifies a threshold under Uraeun protection
- Warns against careless crossing
- Offers safe passage to respectful travelers
- Marks ritual sites

### Social Structure

**The Hold:**
The basic unit—one or two Uraeun tending a specific threshold.

**Characteristics:**
- Small (usually 1-2 adults)
- Focused on single location
- Self-sufficient
- Minimal hierarchy
- Deep connection to specific place

**Responsibilities:**
- Daily threshold-tending (ritual maintenance)
- Monitoring for intrusion or damage
- Assisting legitimate crossers (births, deaths, travelers)
- Communicating via Hettang
- Training young Uraeun (if any)

**Examples:**
- **Doorhold:** Uraeun tending a city gate
- **Bridgehold:** Uraeun at a major bridge
- **Birthhold:** Uraeun assisting midwives
- **Deathhold:** Uraeun guiding dying

**The Coil-Cluster:**
Multiple Holds in a region forming a network.

**Characteristics:**
- 5-20 Holds within one day's travel
- Share region's responsibility
- Support each other in crisis
- Coordinate through Hettang

**Structure:**
- Each Hold remains independent
- Cluster has no formal leader
- Eldest usually coordinates (but doesn't command)
- Decisions by consensus during gatherings

**The Confluence:**
Periodic large gathering of all Uraeun in a region.

**Frequency:** 
- Occurs at equinoxes and solstices
- Special Confluences for major events

**Location:**
- The Coiled Confluence (main site in eastern mountains)
- Regional sites at ley-line nexuses
- Always at major threshold

**Purposes:**
- **Social:** Mating, reunion, news sharing
- **Spiritual:** Major rituals, collective Wehsae
- **Political:** Discuss threats, coordinate responses
- **Educational:** Training, knowledge transmission

**Duration:** 
- Typically 3-7 days
- Some Uraeun travel weeks to attend

**Atmosphere:**
- Part family reunion
- Part religious revival
- Part strategic meeting
- Part celebration

### Life Cycle

**Birth (Hatching):**
- Uraeun lay eggs (2-6 at a time)
- Eggs are laid at threshold sites (never random locations)
- Incubation takes 3-4 months
- Eggs absorb threshold-energy (this is essential)
- Hatching is communal event (entire Coil-Cluster attends)

**Childhood:**
- Young are raised communally (all adults responsible)
- Early training in threshold-tending
- Development of Hettang sense
- First shedding is significant (childhood to youth)

**Coming of Age:**
- **The First Hold:** Young Uraeun (late teens) are assigned first solo Hold
- This is both test and initiation
- Must maintain threshold alone for one full year
- Success = adult status
- Those who fail aren't shamed (try again or take other roles)

**Adulthood:**
- Uraeun typically maintain Holds for decades
- May change Holds throughout life (different thresholds)
- Some specialize (birth-work, death-work, gate-keeping)
- Others generalize (willing to tend any threshold)

**Mating:**
- Occurs at Confluences
- No permanent pair-bonds (Uraeun are non-monogamous)
- Mating is about transformation-cycles, not romance
- Partners selected based on complementary traits
- Children belong to community, not parents specifically

**Elderhood:**
- Older Uraeun often take teaching/coordinating roles
- Less physically demanding Hold work
- Become repositories of knowledge
- Some become Weavers (see Leadership section)

**Death:**
- Uraeun prefer to die at thresholds (especially the one they've kept longest)
- Dying is seen as ultimate threshold-crossing
- Body is buried at the threshold (becomes part of it)
- Name is "released" but memory honored
- They believe consciousness continues in the Hersai

**Lifespan:**
Slightly longer than humans (80-100 years), though stress of threshold-work sometimes shortens this.

### Daily Life

**A Typical Day for a Hold-Keeper:**

**Dawn:** 
- Basking at eastern-facing threshold
- Morning threshold-tending ritual
- Check ley-line connections

**Morning:**
- Practical maintenance (cleaning threshold area)
- Assist any crossers (travelers, workers)
- Monitor for intrusion or damage

**Midday:**
- Rest (if cold-blooded, less active in heat)
- Meditation or study
- Hettang-communication with other Holds

**Afternoon:**
- More threshold-tending
- Receiving reports via Hettang
- Teaching if any apprentices present

**Dusk:**
- Evening threshold-tending ritual
- Basking at western-facing threshold
- Prepare for night watch

**Night:**
- Some Uraeun sleep
- Others maintain vigilance (night thresholds are active)
- Dream-work (thresholds in unconscious)

**Seasonal Variation:**
- Winter: More torpid, less active
- Summer: Highly active, more work done
- Spring/Fall: Moderate activity, major rituals

### Art and Aesthetics

**Visual Arts:**
- Spiral motifs everywhere
- Interlocking patterns
- Threshold-marks as decorative elements
- Scale-pattern textiles
- Stone carving (serpents coiled around doorways)

**Architecture:**
- Buildings designed around thresholds (doorways are central)
- Multiple entrances (every entrance is sacred)
- Spiral stairs and passages
- Underground chambers (comfortable for cold-blooded)
- Integration with natural thresholds

**Music:**
- **Hettang-Singing:** The primary art form
- Complex harmonics (resonating with ley-lines)
- Non-verbal (pure tones, no words)
- Emotional content (joy, warning, grief, celebration)
- Can be "heard" by sensitive beings at distant thresholds

**Poetry:**
- Often about transformation, crossing, change
- Emphasizes transition moments
- Riddles about boundaries (what is neither this nor that?)
- Koan-like paradoxes (the door is open and closed)

**Body Art:**
- Painting on scales (temporary, renewed with each shedding)
- Pattern modification (training scales to grow in certain directions)
- Scar-art (deliberate marking between sheds)

### Religion and Philosophy

**The Hersai is Divine:**
Not a god with personality, but a divine principle—the Between-State itself is sacred.

**No Personified Deity:**
Uraeun don't worship Alys, Revna, or any specific primordial. They worship the *space between* all realms.

**Relationship to Other Traditions:**

**Alysian (Land):** Compatible—land is full of natural thresholds
**Revnan (Dark):** Allied—darkness is the between of lights
**Atargatan (Depths):** Close—water is transition incarnate
**Ostaran (Death):** Respected—death is ultimate threshold
**Katiari (Abyss):** Unknown but intuited—some elder Uraeun sense *something* in the deepest Between

**The Abyss Connection:**
Some philosophers among Uraeun suspect that all thresholds ultimately connect to a single source—a primordial threshold, a boundary between existence and non-existence. They don't know about Katiari specifically, but they've *felt* something watching from the deepest boundaries. Something that *is* the boundary itself.

This makes them potentially crucial to the hero's journey.

**Practices:**

**Daily Threshold-Tending:**
- Ritual cleansing of threshold area
- Offerings (water, grain, flowers)
- Chanting or Hettang-singing
- Physical inspection
- Ley-line monitoring

**The Wehsae (Shedding):**
Primary sacrament—transformation made physical.

**Threshold-Walking:**
Meditation practice:
- Walk back and forth through threshold
- Focus on the exact moment of crossing
- Perceive the infinite possibility in that instant
- Achieve altered consciousness

**The Crossing-Assistance:**
Uraeun often help others cross major thresholds:
- Birthing mothers (crossing into motherhood)
- Dying people (crossing into death)
- Adolescents (crossing into adulthood)
- Travelers at dangerous passes

**This isn't interference**—it's sacred duty. The Uraeun ensure crossings happen safely and properly.

## Leadership and Hierarchy

### Structure

**No Central Government:**
Uraeun have no king, no emperor, no high priest. They're too dispersed and independent for centralized authority.

**The Weavers (Hettang-Weavers):**
The closest thing to leadership—elders who maintain the ley-line network and coordinate responses to major threats.

**Who They Are:**
- Eldest, most sensitive Hettang-singers
- Usually 10-15 individuals across the continent
- Informally recognized, not formally elected
- Serve until death or retirement

**What They Do:**
- Monitor the ley-line network as a whole
- Detect patterns individual Holds miss
- Coordinate response to major events
- Preserve knowledge and train sensitives
- Mediate disputes between Holds

**How They Coordinate:**
- Constant Hettang-communication
- Meet physically at major Confluences
- Make recommendations (not commands)
- Respected but not obeyed automatically

**Current Weavers Include:**
- Elder Coil-Keeper (oldest, tending threshold since before the Passing)
- The Shedded-Many (has undergone ritual transformation 80+ times)
- The Silent One (mute but most sensitive Hettang-receiver)
- The Bridge-Between-Waters (amphibious Uraeun, connects land and sea thresholds)

### Power Dynamics

**Consensus-Based:**
Uraeun make major decisions through extended debate at Confluences. Weavers facilitate but don't dictate.

**Individual Autonomy:**
Each Hold-Keeper has absolute authority over their threshold. No one can command them to tend differently.

**Reputation Matters:**
Influence comes from:
- Age and experience
- Hettang sensitivity
- Successful threshold-keeping
- Wisdom in counsel

**The Post-Passing Disruption:**
Normally, the decentralized system works. But the Passing damaged so many ley-lines that coordination became critical. The Weavers are under unprecedented pressure. Some advocate for more centralized response. Others insist on traditional autonomy.

This tension shapes current Uraeun politics.

## Key Figures

### Elder Coil-Keeper (The Ancient One)

**Full Name:** Officially unnamed (released last name at final Wehsae)
**Common Title:** Elder Coil-Keeper, The Ancient One, Grandmother of Thresholds
**Role:** Eldest Weaver; keeper of the Coiled Confluence
**Age:** Unknown (at least 120; possibly older)
**Appearance:** Ancient beyond measure; scales have turned grey-white; moves slowly but deliberately; eyes like polished amber; multiple scars from centuries of shedding; blind in one eye but Hettang-vision compensates

**Character:**

No one knows her birth-name. She's shed it along with everything else over her unnaturally long life. She's undergone so many Wehsae that she's left behind not just skin but entire identities. Each shedding, she releases more—names, attachments, desires, even memories.

What remains is pure essence: threshold-keeper, teacher, witness.

She maintains the Coiled Confluence—the deep cavern system that serves as the Uraeun's most sacred site. She's been there for seventy years, alone except during Confluences. She tends the greatest threshold-nexus on the continent—the place where dozens of ley-lines meet.

She rarely speaks. When she does, her voice is like stone grinding on stone, dry and ancient. She communicates primarily through Hettang-singing, and her songs can be heard by sensitive Uraeun across half the continent.

Since the Passing, she's been... agitated. The ley-lines damaged under her watch—the first time this has happened in centuries. She's working frantically to repair them, calling on younger Uraeun for help. Some worry she's pushing herself too hard. Others think she knows something she's not sharing.

**Goal:** Repair the Net of the Between before she dies. Ensure the next generation can maintain it.

**Complication:** She's dying. She knows it. This might be her last Wehsae, and after it, she won't emerge. She's trying to teach everything she knows before she crosses the final threshold.

**Current Action:** Calling a Grand Confluence—the first in fifty years. Every Uraeun who can travel is being summoned. Something needs to be shared, decided, or done. She won't say what until they gather.

**Quote:** *"I have crossed ten thousand thresholds. I have shed myself until almost nothing remains. Soon I will cross the last threshold, and I will not return. But the Hersai endures. It always endures. You will endure. Tend your thresholds. The Between needs you."*

---

### The Shedded-Many (The Transformer)

**Full Name:** Currently "Spiral-Who-Becomes"
**Previous Names:** At least twelve others (changes with each major Wehsae)
**Role:** Weaver; master of transformation rituals
**Age:** Approximately 60
**Appearance:** Vibrant scales in shifting patterns (colors seem to change between shedings); eyes that reflect whatever they're looking at; graceful, fluid movement; wears shed skin as ritual garments

**Character:**

The Shedded-Many has undergone more ritual Wehsae than almost any living Uraeun. While normal Uraeun shed once or twice per year, they've learned to trigger sacred shedding deliberately—sometimes four or five times annually.

Each shedding is accompanied by profound psychological transformation. They don't just molt skin—they transform identity. They've been male and female (biologically shifting through some mechanism others don't understand). They've been warrior, scholar, mystic, teacher. They become someone new with each emergence.

Most Uraeun think this is holy. Some think it's pathological. The Shedded-Many doesn't care what others think—they're pursuing the deepest mysteries of the Hersai through constant transformation.

They teach that identity is illusion, that the only truth is change, that trying to stay the same is the only real death. They guide others through difficult Wehsae—helping Uraeun shed not just skin but trauma, grief, old wounds.

Post-Passing, they've been working with Uraeun traumatized by what they witnessed. Some Holds saw terrible things during the Passing (thresholds opening to let through... wrongness). The Shedded-Many helps them release these memories, shed them like damaged skin.

**Goal:** Help Uraeun collectively shed the trauma of the Passing. Transform as people, as culture, to survive what's coming.

**Complication:** Their constant transformation makes others uneasy. You can never predict who they'll be next. Some worry they're losing continuity—that they'll shed so much they'll disappear entirely.

**Current Action:** Developing a new ritual—a collective Wehsae where many Uraeun shed together, releasing the Passing's trauma as one. It's unprecedented, possibly dangerous, maybe necessary.

**Quote:** *"You think you are your name, your history, your wounds. You are not. You are the one who transforms. Everything else is just skin you'll shed eventually. Why wait? Why not become who you need to be now?"*

---

### The Silent One (The Listener)

**Full Name:** None (never spoke, never named)
**Common Title:** The Silent One, The Pure Receiver, Ears-of-the-Hersai
**Role:** Weaver; master Hettang-receiver
**Age:** Approximately 45
**Appearance:** Pale scales (almost translucent); enormous eyes that never focus on anything physical; thin, almost emaciated build; moves like flowing water; wears no clothing (unnecessary for cold-blooded in the deep places)

**Character:**

The Silent One has never spoken a word. Not because they're unable—they simply never have. From hatching, they were silent. Other Uraeun communicate through Hettang-singing. The Silent One only receives.

But their receiving is unmatched. They can hear Hettang-songs from across the continent. They can sense emotions in ley-lines that others miss. They can detect blockages, damage, and intrusion that would escape normal monitoring.

They serve as the Weavers' primary sensor—the one who *knows* what's happening across the network. When a threshold is in danger, they feel it. When ley-lines are damaged, they sense it immediately. They're the early warning system for the entire Uraeun people.

They communicate through:
- Physical gesture (fluid, dance-like)
- Emotional projection (others feel what they want to convey)
- Written symbols (they draw rather than speak)
- Proxy speakers (other Uraeun interpret for them)

Since the Passing, they've been overwhelmed. Too much damage, too much chaos, too much wrong information flooding the ley-lines. They've been in a semi-trance state, processing everything they're receiving. The other Weavers are worried—if the Silent One breaks, the Uraeun lose their best sensor.

**Goal:** Process and convey what they're sensing. Help others understand the scope of the damage. Find pattern in the chaos.

**Complication:** They're receiving something else now—something that wasn't there before. A watching presence in the deepest boundaries. Something that feels... patient. They don't know what it is. They're not sure whether to be terrified or hopeful.

**Current Action:** Creating a vast pictographic map of what they're sensing—symbols drawn on cave walls showing the topology of threshold-space post-Passing. It's almost comprehensible. Almost.

**Quote:** [The Silent One has never spoken and never will. But if they could, they might say: *"I hear everything. Every crossing, every threshold, every transformation. I hear joy and grief and fear and hope. I hear the Net of the Between straining, damaged, desperate to heal. And underneath it all, I hear someone waiting. Someone who IS waiting, who IS patience, who IS the Between itself. She has been there forever. We just never listened deeply enough."*]

## Goals and Tensions

### Primary Goal

**Repair the Net of the Between:** The ley-line network was damaged by the Passing. Thresholds are malfunctioning. The Uraeun must repair this before something terrible happens.

### Secondary Goals

1. **Maintain Threshold-Keeping:** Despite crisis, daily work must continue
2. **Train Next Generation:** Many young Uraeun died in the Passing; knowledge must be transmitted
3. **Understand the Damage:** What exactly happened? How do we prevent recurrence?
4. **Build Alliances:** Uraeun need help; must reach out to other traditions
5. **Survive Church Persecution:** Scourers hunt "serpents"; self-defense is necessary

### Internal Tensions

**Autonomy vs. Coordination:**

Traditionally, each Hold operates independently. But the current crisis requires unprecedented coordination. Some Uraeun want to maintain autonomy (our way for millennia). Others advocate temporary centralization (crisis demands it).

**The Weavers are caught between these positions.**

**Traditional vs. Innovative:**

Should Uraeun:
- Repair ley-lines using traditional methods (slow but proven)
- Try new experimental approaches (faster but risky)

**The Shedded-Many represents innovation. Elder Coil-Keeper represents tradition. Both have valid points.**

**Isolation vs. Alliance:**

Should Uraeun:
- Handle crisis alone (as they always have)
- Seek help from other traditions (unprecedented)

**Seeking help means revealing secrets. Secrets kept for millennia. But maybe survival requires trust?**

**The Abyss Question:**

The Silent One isn't the only Uraeun sensing *something* in the deepest thresholds. Some think it's:
- Katiari (though they don't know that name)
- A threat (eldritch entity using thresholds)
- An opportunity (access to primordial power)

**Should they investigate or avoid? No consensus.**

### External Tensions

**With the Solarian Church:**

**Church Position:** Serpents are deceivers, servants of darkness, agents of the devil.

**Biblical Precedent:** The serpent in the garden = evil incarnate (in Church theology)

**Result:** Persecution. Scourers hunt Uraeun. Some have been burned.

**Uraeun Position:** We're not demons. We're threshold-keepers. We worship the Between, not darkness. But explaining this to people trying to kill you is difficult.

**The Irony:** Church uses thresholds (baptism, last rites, church doors) without understanding them. Uraeun maintain these thresholds anyway—because thresholds matter regardless of who uses them.

**With Humanity Generally:**

**Human Reaction to Snake-People:** 
- Instinctive fear (snakes = danger in human brain)
- Cultural prejudice (Church teachings)
- Fascination (exotic, mysterious)
- Superstition (snakes = magic, poison, deception)

**Uraeun Response:**
- Avoid humans when possible
- Hide their nature if interaction necessary
- Grateful to humans who overcome prejudice

**With the Revnan Tradition:**

**Natural Allies:**
- Both worship "other half" (Dark, Between)
- Both persecuted by Church
- Both understand that hidden things are sacred

**Current Cooperation:**
- Some Revnan practitioners learn Hettang-singing
- Some Uraeun study Dark-field meditation
- Shared rituals at liminal times/places

**The Challenge:** Revnan practitioners are human (mostly). Uraeun are not. Can trust overcome biology?

**With the Atargatan Tradition:**

**Deep Connection:**
- Water is ultimate threshold (fluid/not-solid)
- Rivers are ley-lines made physical
- Coastlines are sacred boundaries
- Tides are temporal thresholds

**The Cooperation:**
- Uraeun maintain land-water thresholds
- Atargatan peoples maintain underwater threshold-equivalents
- Shared knowledge of threshold topology

**The Shio-Gatis Connection:**
- The Tide-Changed live at ultimate threshold (land/sea)
- They naturally practice threshold-keeping
- Some are part-Uraeun or closely allied
- Natural partners

**With the Fae:**

**Complicated:**
- Fae respect threshold-keepers (they understand importance)
- But Fae have their own rules about boundaries
- Sometimes Uraeun and Fae clash over whose rules apply

**The Lady of the Lake:** 
If she exists, she's a threshold-keeper of sorts (lake/land/mystery). Potential ally or rival, depending.

**With the Daevani:**

**Potential Allies:**
- Both persecuted as "serpents/demons"
- Both misunderstood by Church
- Both worship non-Light realm-fields

**The Challenge:**
- Limited contact (Daevani are hidden)
- Different theologies (Dream-space vs. Threshold-space)
- But growing mutual respect

**With Katiari (Unknown):**

The Uraeun don't know about Katiari. But some are sensing... something. A presence in the deepest Between. A watching consciousness made of boundaries themselves.

**When the hero seeks Katiari, the Uraeun will be essential guides.** They know threshold-space better than anyone. They can navigate the boundaries that lead to the Abyss.

- Communal resources at Confluence sites

**The Coiled Confluence:**
- Deep cave system in eastern mountains
- Sacred site and gathering place
- Contains ancient knowledge (stone carvings, preserved sheds)
- Secure, hidden, temperature-stable

**Holds Across the Continent:**
- Hundreds of maintained thresholds
- Network of safe places
- Access to information through Hettang

### Institutional Power

**None Formal:**
- No legal recognition
- No political authority
- No military force

**Invisible Influence:**
- They maintain thresholds everyone uses

### The Hettang Network

**The True Power:**

**Communication:**
- Instant messaging across vast distances
- Secure (most people can't intercept)
- Emotional content (more than words)

**Coordination:**
- Rapid response to threats
- Collective knowledge sharing
- Warning system

**Intelligence:**
- Monitor movement through thresholds
- Detect anomalies
- Sense approaching danger

**The Damage:**
Since the Passing, this network is compromised. Repairing it is priority one.

### Knowledge and Secrets

**Threshold-Lore:**
- Millennia of observation and practice
- Understanding of ley-line topology
- Ritual techniques for threshold work
- Knowledge of what lies beyond thresholds

**The Between-State:**

**Secret Histories:**
- Uraeun have maintained Holds for thousands of years
- They've witnessed events others forgot
- They know things the Church tried to erase

**The Katiari Connection:**
Some elder Uraeun have sensed something in the deepest thresholds. They don't know what it is, but they've kept records. When someone seeks the forgotten sister, these records might be essential.

## Adventure Hooks

### 1. The Blocked Threshold

**Situation:** A major river-mouth—where a significant river meets the sea—has "closed." Ships can sail through physically, but something is wrong. Fish won't enter or leave. River-folk (En-He-Dao) report feeling "stuck." The Shio-Gatis (tide-changed) are in pain when they try to cross.

An Uraeun Hold-Keeper at the site—**Scales-of-Flowing-Water**—has been working desperately to reopen the threshold. It's not responding to traditional techniques. She's called for help through the Hettang.

The party is asked to assist. They must:
- Investigate what's blocking the threshold
- Help Scales-of-Flowing-Water repair it
- Prevent ecological disaster (if fish can't migrate, they die)

**The Question:** What blocks a metaphysical boundary? How do you repair something you can't see?

**Complications:**
- The blockage is Passing-related (new type of damage)
- Traditional threshold-tending doesn't work
- Scales-of-Flowing-Water is exhausted, near collapse
- Local humans blame "the serpent" for the problem
- Time pressure: spawning season is coming
- The blockage might be intentional (something doesn't want the threshold open)
- Party might need to enter threshold-space itself (dangerous)

**Possible Resolutions:**
- Find and remove physical/spiritual obstruction
- Learn new technique from Silent One's research
- Seek help from Atargatan peoples
- Discover the blockage is warning sign (don't open it)
- Partial repair (good enough for now)
- This reveals larger pattern of threshold damage

---

### 2. The Stolen Eggs

**Situation:** A clutch of Uraeun eggs was stolen from a threshold-nest. This is unprecedented—eggs are sacred, always protected, laid at guarded thresholds. But someone (or something) took them.

The parent Uraeun—**Coil-of-Grief**—is devastated. She's hired the party to track down the eggs before they hatch (in weeks). Without threshold-energy during incubation, the hatchlings will be born... wrong. Damaged. Maybe dead.

Investigation reveals: A human "collector" hired thieves to steal exotic eggs. He doesn't know what they are (just "rare serpent eggs"). He's keeping them in a heated room, thinking he's helping. He's actually killing them.

**The Question:** How do you explain the sacred to those who don't understand? How do you recover what's been profaned?

**Complications:**
- The collector is wealthy, politically connected
- He genuinely thinks he's preserving rare species
- The eggs are dying slowly (time pressure)
- Coil-of-Grief wants to kill the collector (justified rage)
- Other Uraeun are divided (mercy vs. justice)
- If eggs hatch without threshold-energy, hatchlings may be monstrous
- Legal system won't recognize Uraeun property rights
- Violence would confirm "serpents are dangerous"

**Possible Resolutions:**
- Negotiate return (convince collector)
- Steal eggs back (risky but fast)
- Kill collector (satisfying but problematic)
- Move eggs to threshold immediately (can they be saved?)
- Educate collector (long-term solution)
- This becomes case about Uraeun rights and sacred property

---

### 3. The Wehsae Gone Wrong

**Situation:** A young Uraeun—**Bright-Scale-Becoming**—is attempting their first solo Wehsae (shedding). It's going wrong. They started the molt, but can't complete it. They're stuck—literally, physically trapped in the old skin that won't fully release, spiritually trapped between identities.

They're in agony. They're terrified. If they don't complete the Wehsae soon, they'll die (trapped in old skin, unable to breathe or move properly).

**The Shedded-Many** has summoned the party. They need help:
- Determine what went wrong
- Help Bright-Scale-Becoming complete the Wehsae
- Discover if this is isolated incident or new problem

**The Question:** What happens when sacred transformation fails? How do you help someone finish becoming?

**Complications:**
- Physical danger (Bright-Scale-Becoming is suffocating)
- Psychological trauma (this is their most vulnerable moment)
- Spiritual implications (incomplete Wehsae is bad omen)
- The Shedded-Many suspects Passing-damage
- Other young Uraeun are terrified (will this happen to them?)
- Traditional solutions aren't working
- Might need to physically help remove skin (intensely intimate, possibly offensive)
- OR might need to enter threshold-space to help spiritually

**Possible Resolutions:**
- Physical intervention (carefully remove stuck skin)
- Spiritual intervention (guide them through meditation)
- Discover cause (environmental toxin, Passing-damage, psychological block)
- The Shedded-Many performs ritual they've never tried
- Bright-Scale-Becoming emerges transformed (but how?)
- This reveals new Passing effect on Uraeun

---

### 4. The Reft at the Threshold

**Situation:** A Coil-Cluster reports disturbing pattern: Reft are gathering at thresholds. Not attacking, not moving—just *standing there*. At doorways. At bridges. At cave mouths. Silent, motionless, watching.

This is new behavior. Reft normally wander or attack. These are just... waiting.

Uraeun can't tend thresholds with Reft present (dangerous, disturbing). But they can't abandon the Holds either (unprotected thresholds are worse). They need help.

**Elder Coil-Keeper** has requested the party investigate. What are the Reft doing? Why thresholds specifically? How can Holds be reclaimed?

**The Question:** What happens when the dead occupy the boundaries? What are they waiting for?

**Complications:**
- Reft don't attack but won't leave
- Killing them doesn't work (more come)
- They're blocking important crossings
- Uraeun sense wrongness (thresholds are being corrupted)
- Pattern is spreading (more thresholds affected daily)
- Reft seem to be "listening" or "watching" for something
- Maybe they're trying to cross? (To where?)
- Silent One senses something on the other side calling them

**Possible Resolutions:**
- Find what's calling them and stop it
- Exorcism/cleansing rituals
- Open the thresholds (let Reft cross to... wherever)
- Close thresholds entirely (dangerous but stops Reft)
- Discover Reft are trying to go home (to death realm)
- This connects to larger Ostaran mystery
- Katiari's realm might be involved (Abyss draws the lost)

---

### 5. The Church Comes Knocking

**Situation:** A new priest has arrived in a region where Uraeun have maintained Holds peacefully for decades. **Father Cyril** is a Scourer—zealous, intelligent, dangerous. He's discovered evidence of "serpent demon activity."

He's organizing a purge. He has local support (Church authority + human fear). He has the law on his side (no legal protection for Uraeun). He has weapons and soldiers.

The local Coil-Cluster is in danger—ten Holds, about fifteen Uraeun, including hatchlings. They can flee (abandon thresholds). They can hide (temporary solution). They can fight (violent escalation). Or they can seek help.

**Scales-of-Flowing-Water** (from Hook #1) has contacted the party. Can they:
- Stop Father Cyril?
- Change his mind?
- Evacuate Uraeun safely?
- Protect the thresholds?

**The Question:** How do you fight institutional power backed by prejudice? When is violence justified in self-defense?

**Complications:**
- Father Cyril is sincere (genuinely believes he's fighting demons)
- Local humans are divided (some support Uraeun, some don't)
- Legal system sides with Church
- Violence would confirm "serpents are dangerous"
- Fleeing means abandoning thresholds (consequences unclear but bad)
- The Uraeun elders counsel non-violence
- Young Uraeun want to fight
- Some humans will die if Holds are abandoned (births/deaths unattended)

**Possible Resolutions:**
- Convince Father Cyril (nearly impossible but not entirely)
- Political pressure (appeal to higher authority)
- Expose Church corruption (undermine his support)
- Help Uraeun flee (save lives, lose thresholds)
- Defend violently (saves Uraeun, confirms prejudice)
- Martyrdom (some Uraeun accept death to prove innocence)
- This becomes turning point in Church-Uraeun relations

---

### 6. The Grand Confluence

**Situation:** **Elder Coil-Keeper** has called a Grand Confluence—first in fifty years. Every Uraeun who can travel is summoned to the Coiled Confluence. It's an unprecedented gathering (hundreds of Uraeun).

The party is invited as honored guests (very rare for non-Uraeun). This is:
- Cultural immersion (see Uraeun society at its fullest)
- Political event (major decisions will be made)
- Sacred ritual (Wehsae ceremonies, threshold-walking)
- Intelligence gathering (what are Uraeun planning?)

But it's also dangerous. Bringing so many Uraeun together makes them vulnerable. Scourers would love to know about this. The location is secret, but secrets leak.

**The Question:** What does the Elder want to tell them? What decision requires everyone present?

**Complications:**
- The Elder is dying (this might be her last Confluence)
- She has urgent message (about threshold damage? About what's coming?)
- Scourers might learn of gathering (potential massacre)
- Internal Uraeun divisions (autonomy vs. coordination)
- Silent One will reveal their map (cosmic topology post-Passing)
- Shedded-Many will propose radical collective Wehsae
- Party must navigate Uraeun protocols (guest-right, spiral-walking, etc.)
- Something might attack during Confluence (Reft? Eldritch? Katiari manifestation?)

**Possible Resolutions:**
- Elder delivers message (changes Uraeun direction)
- Confluence makes major decision (affects all Holds)
- Party helps defend against attack
- Party makes alliance with Uraeun
- Revelation about threshold-space/Katiari/future
- This becomes foundation for larger cooperation

---

### 7. The Threshold to Nowhere

**Situation:** An Uraeun Hold-Keeper—**Spiral-of-Empty-Spaces**—has discovered a new threshold. Not a doorway, not a cave mouth, not a natural boundary. An *impossible* threshold.

It appeared after the Passing. It's a crack in reality. On one side: the material world. On the other side: *absence*. Not darkness (that's something). Not death (that's something). Just... nothing. The absence of everything.

Spiral-of-Empty-Spaces is terrified and fascinated. They're tending it (what else can you do with a threshold?) but they don't understand it. They've called for a Weaver. **The Silent One** responded—and immediately became transfixed.

The Silent One is now staring into the threshold, unmoving. They're receiving something. They won't explain what. The other Uraeun are worried.

The party is asked to investigate. What is this threshold? Where does it lead? Is the Silent One in danger? Should it be closed or protected?

**The Question:** What lies beyond existence? Should some thresholds remain closed?

**Complications:**
- This might be a crack to the Abyss (Katiari's realm)
- The Silent One senses the watching presence here
- Looking into it too long causes psychological effects
- Some who stare into it don't want to leave
- It might be spreading (crack getting larger)
- It might be doorway to primordial medium
- Closing it might be impossible (or catastrophic)
- Opening it might be worse
- The hero's journey might require this threshold

**Possible Resolutions:**
- Seal the threshold (traditional response)
- Study it carefully (academic approach)
- Enter it (extremely dangerous exploration)
- Protect it (it's sacred, regardless of danger)
- Silent One emerges with revelation (about Katiari)
- This becomes key to finding the forgotten sister
- Or this becomes warning about what lies beyond

## Current Status and Future Trajectory

### Immediate Situation (Months Post-Passing)

The Uraeun are in **crisis mode**. The ley-line network is damaged. Thresholds are malfunctioning. The Net of the Between is breaking down.

**What They're Doing:**
- Emergency repairs on most damaged ley-lines
- Documenting new types of threshold-problems
- Calling in favors from allied traditions
- Preparing for Grand Confluence
- Defending against Scourer attacks
- Trying to understand what happened

**What Others Notice:**
- More Uraeun visible (desperate times require breaking cover)
- Thresholds behaving strangely (doors that shouldn't open, bridges that feel wrong)
- Uraeun seeking help (unprecedented)
- Hettang-songs becoming audible (network strained, leaking)

### Medium-Term Trajectory (1-3 Years)

**The Repair Project:**
If successful: Network restored, crisis averted, Uraeun proven essential
If failed: Cascading threshold failures, consequences unknown but catastrophic

**The Alliance Question:**
Will Uraeun:
- Continue isolated work (traditional)
- Build permanent alliances (necessary but scary)
- Teach threshold-keeping to others (radical idea)

**Different Holds will make different choices**, potentially fracturing unity.

**The Church Question:**
As post-Passing society reorganizes, will persecution:
- Intensify (scapegoating)
- Continue at current level (inertia)
- Decrease (new understanding)

**The Uraeun's response will affect this outcome.**

### Long-Term Trajectory (Decades)

**Possible Futures:**

**Network Restored:**
Uraeun successfully repair the Net of the Between. They're recognized as essential. Persecution decreases. They emerge from hiding. Threshold-keeping becomes respected profession.

**Catastrophic Failure:**
The network collapses. Thresholds fail worldwide. Consequences include: realm-field boundaries breaking down, eldritch intrusions through failed thresholds, people trapped between worlds, Uraeun unable to fulfill their purpose.

**Integration:**
Uraeun teach threshold-keeping to other peoples. Knowledge spreads. The work becomes collective. Uraeun remain special but not alone.

**Extinction:**
Persecution and crisis combine. Population too small to maintain all thresholds. Uraeun die out. Their knowledge is lost. Thresholds go untended. World suffers but doesn't understand why.

**Transcendence:**
Deep work with threshold-space transforms Uraeun. They become something new—beings OF the Between, not just tenders of it. Living thresholds themselves.

**The Katiari Connection:**
When someone seeks the forgotten sister, the Uraeun will be essential. They know threshold-space. The Silent One is already sensing her presence. They can navigate the boundaries that lead to the Abyss. They might be the only ones who can.

And Katiari, goddess of boundaries, will recognize her threshold-keepers.

## Using the Uraeun in Your Game

### As Allies
- Provide threshold-navigation expertise
- Offer Hettang communication across distances
- Share knowledge of hidden paths and boundaries
- Grant access to threshold-space (for travel or magic)
- Teach about transformation and change

### As Complications
- Their presence attracts persecution
- Threshold-keeping duties take precedence over everything
- They speak in riddles about boundaries and change
- Their long-term thinking clashes with short-term needs
- Helping them requires entering dangerous spaces

### As Teachers
- Demonstrate that boundaries connect as much as separate
- Show value of transformation
- Model patient, essential, invisible work
- Reveal that in-between spaces are real and important
- Embody the principle that change is sacred

### As Guides
- To threshold-space (literal and metaphorical)
- To understanding of realm-field boundaries
- To the Abyss (if seeking Katiari)
- Through difficult transformations
- Across dangerous boundaries

### Key Principles

1. **Threshold-Keepers:** This is their sacred duty, their entire identity

2. **The Between is Real:** Not metaphor—actual metaphysical space

3. **Patient and Essential:** Their work is invisible but critical

4. **Transformation-Focused:** Change is sacred; shedding is worship

5. **Dispersed but Connected:** Individual Holds, collective network

6. **Cold-Blooded Affects Everything:** Biology shapes culture

7. **The Hettang Sense:** Unique ability, core to their identity

8. **Persecuted but Enduring:** Church hunts them; they persist

---

*The Uraeun are the threshold-keepers. They stand in doorways, basking in the sun, maintaining boundaries that most people don't know exist. They shed their skin in ritual transformation, releasing the past to embrace the future. They sing through ley-lines, communicating across distances in songs of emotion and warning. They are patient. They are essential. They are the keepers of the Between, and without them, the thresholds would fail. The world needs them even when it fears them. They are serpent-people, yes. But they are not deceivers. They are the ones who maintain the boundaries that keep reality intact. They are the Uraeun, and they're working desperately to repair what the Passing broke. They need help. Will you answer their call?*
