# Overview

| Attribute           | Value                                       |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Type**            | Political/Cultural                          |
| **Status**          | Active (Crisis)                             |
| **Scope**           | Ynys Wyllt (the Wild Isle)                  |
| **Primary Base**    | Scattered holds across the Wild Isle        |
| **Symbol/Heraldry** | Varies by house; iron weapons common to all |

The Wylltic Lords are the traditional aristocracy of Ynys Wyllt—the chiefs, jarls, and kings who've ruled the Wild Isle through lineage, strength, and the allegiance of their warriors. They're not one faction so much as a category: dozens of competing houses bound by shared tradition, endless feuds, and the understanding that whatever they do to each other, they stand united against outsiders.

For centuries, the Lords maintained the rhythm that defined Wylltic life: raiding in summer, feasting in winter, feuding always. The Empire was enemy, the sea was opportunity, and iron was sacred because the Fae hated it. Simple rules that produced fierce, independent people.

The Passing broke everything. The raids stopped because there was nothing left to raid for. The feuds intensified because resources shrank. Something dark has been stirring in the isle's interior, and the Lords can't agree whether to fight it, appease it, or embrace it.

# Part One: The Tradition

## What the Lords Were

Traditional Wylltic lordship combined several elements:

**Warrior Aristocracy:**
Lords proved themselves through combat, led warriors in battle, and maintained power through demonstrated strength. A weak lord lost followers to stronger rivals.

**Ship-Holdings:**
Power was measured partly in ships. The more vessels a lord commanded, the more raids he could launch, the more followers he could reward, the more influence he wielded.

**Land-Claims:**
Unlike pure sea-raiders, Wylltic lords also held territory—valleys, coastlines, sometimes whole islands in the archipelago. Land provided food; ships provided wealth; together they made power.

**Religious Sanction:**
Lords maintained völva advisors and honored the old ways. A lord who lost völva support lost legitimacy.

## The Hierarchy

| Rank                   | Domain                      | Count                   |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| **High King (Ard Rí)** | Nominal rule over all Wyllt | 0 (vacant for 60 years) |
| **Kings (Rí)**         | Major regions               | ~5                      |
| **Jarls**              | Significant territories     | ~20-30                  |
| **Thanes (Toisech)**   | Local areas                 | ~100+                   |

**No Effective Unity:**
The High Kingship has been contested for three generations. None of the current kings can claim it; none will accept another's claim. The result is perpetual fragmentation.

# Part Two: Current State

## The Crisis

The Passing devastated the Wild Isle:

**Population Collapse:**
Estimates suggest 30-40% mortality—similar to the mainland but without the mainland's resources for recovery.

**Economic Breakdown:**
With the Empire in chaos, there's nothing to raid. With trade routes broken, there's nothing to trade. The island's marginal agriculture can't support its population.

**Spiritual Chaos:**
The völur split between traditionalists and blood-workers has left lords without reliable counsel. Some have embraced blood-magic; others reject it; all are uncertain.

**The Interior Darkness:**
Something is wrong in the Wild Isle's mountainous interior. Villages have gone silent. Hunters report things moving in the forests. The old burial mounds are stirring.

## Current Factions Among Lords

| Faction             | Position                                | Leaders              |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| **Traditionalists** | Maintain old ways; resist change        | King Cadwgan the Old |
| **Blood-Sworn**     | Embrace blood-magic for survival        | Jarl Morcar the Red  |
| **Pragmatists**     | Negotiate with anyone, including Empire | King Rhys            |
| **Isolationists**   | Withdraw to defensible positions; wait  | Various              |

# Part Three: Key Figures

### King Cadwgan the Old

| Attribute | Value                        |
| --------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Title** | King of Môn (largest island) |
| **Role**  | Senior traditionalist lord   |
| **Age**   | 74                           |

**Character:** Cadwgan has ruled Môn for forty years—the longest reign in living memory. He's survived through cunning, measured violence, and knowing when to yield. He's also the last link to how things were before the current madness.

He opposes the blood-magic turn with everything he has. The old ways worked for centuries; abandoning them because of one crisis is cowardice and corruption. The völur who remember properly agree with him. So do the ancestors who watch from beyond.

He's losing. His warriors are older, fewer each year. Young men flock to Morcar's blood-sworn because blood-magic produces visible results. Cadwgan can only offer tradition against power.

**Goal:** Preserve traditional Wylltic ways until the current madness burns out and sanity returns.

**Complication:** Cadwgan's heir, his grandson Owain, has been secretly meeting with blood-worker representatives. The old king suspects but doesn't want to confirm.

### Jarl Morcar the Red

| Attribute | Value                                     |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Title** | Jarl of Dinas Carreg (the Stone Fortress) |
| **Role**  | Leader of the blood-sworn faction         |
| **Age**   | 41                                        |

**Character:** Morcar was an ambitious but minor jarl when the Passing came. He embraced blood-magic early—not from desperation but from recognition of opportunity. While the old lords wrung their hands, he acted.

His power has grown rapidly. Blood-worker völur advise him; younger warriors eager for results follow him; territories that old lords could no longer defend have fallen to his control. He's now the strongest single lord on the Wild Isle.

He believes he's saving his people. The old ways failed; new ways must replace them. Squeamishness about blood-magic is the luxury of those who've never watched children starve. He's done terrible things—sacrifices, conquests, transformations—but he's kept his people alive.

**Goal:** Unite the Wild Isle under his rule; use blood-magic to make it strong enough to never need fear the Empire again.

**Complication:** The Blood Field is demanding more. Morcar's völva advisor, a blood-worker named Eira, tells him that greater power requires greater sacrifice. He's already crossed lines he'd once have thought impossible. The next line is his own family.

### King Rhys the Compromiser

| Attribute | Value                        |
| --------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Title** | King of the Western Fjords   |
| **Role**  | Leader of pragmatist faction |
| **Age**   | 52                           |

**Character:** Rhys is a survivor. He's survived four wars, two assassination attempts, and the deaths of his first two families. He's learned that adaptability matters more than principle—principles get you killed; flexibility keeps you alive.

He's been sending secret messages to Imperial contacts, exploring what cooperation might look like. Not submission—the Wild Isle will never submit—but perhaps accommodation. The Empire has problems too; maybe problems can be solved together.

The traditionalists call him traitor; the blood-sworn call him weak. He calls himself realistic. Someone has to think past the current bloodbath to what comes after.

**Goal:** Negotiate a sustainable relationship with outside powers that lets the Wild Isle survive without destroying itself.

**Complication:** Rhys's negotiations require secrecy; discovery would unite all other factions against him. He's also not sure the Empire would honor any agreement—or that the Empire will exist long enough to be a reliable partner.

# Part Four: Goals & Tensions

## Primary Goal

**Survival**

The Lords face existential crisis. Their primary goal is ensuring their people—and their own houses—survive whatever's happening.

## Factional Goals

| Faction         | Goal                                 |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Traditionalists | Outlast the crisis; restore old ways |
| Blood-Sworn     | Unite under blood-magic leadership   |
| Pragmatists     | Negotiate external support           |
| Isolationists   | Defend what can be held              |

## Internal Tensions

### Blood-Magic Division
The fundamental split between those who accept blood-magic and those who reject it defines current Wylltic politics.

### Succession Crises
Multiple houses have unclear succession after Passing losses. Competition for lordship compounds other conflicts.

### Resource Wars
Not enough food, ships, or warriors to maintain traditional holdings. Lords fight over what remains.

# Part Five: Adventure Hooks

## 1. The Negotiation Mission

**Situation:** King Rhys needs external agents—people who aren't Wylltic and can therefore enter spaces his own people can't—to explore contact with the Empire. Specifically, he wants to reach the Council of Captains on the Golden Coast, proposing limited cooperation.

**The Question:** Can the mission reach the Captains without discovery? Would the Captains accept Wylltic overtures? And what happens when other Wylltic factions learn about the negotiation?

## 2. The Succession War

**Situation:** King Cadwgan has died. His grandson Owain claims the throne of Môn, but his blood-worker sympathies are now known. Traditionalist lords want intervention to prevent the most important traditionalist kingdom from falling to corruption.

**The Question:** Who should rule Môn? Can the succession be influenced from outside? And what does it mean for the Wild Isle's future if either faction wins completely?
