| Attribute           | Value                                                            |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Type**            | Cultural/Political                                               |

| **Scope**           | International (Southern Territories)                             |

| **Symbol/Heraldry** | A stylized dragon coiled around a sun — service to eternal power |

The Dragon-Kin Hegemony is the collective name for the cultures and peoples who serve the great dragons of the southern lands. Unlike the Empire, which was built by humans for humans, the Hegemony was built by dragons who shaped everything—landscapes, cultures, economies, even the people themselves—to serve draconic purposes.

The dragons are real. They are vast, ancient, and intelligent in ways humans struggle to comprehend. They have ruled their territories since before human memory. The Hegemony isn't a metaphor or an exaggeration: the dragon-kin are literally kin to dragons, bred over millennia to serve as intermediaries, administrators, and extensions of draconic will.

The Passing did not significantly affect the Dragonlands. Whatever failed elsewhere, the dragons' power continued to function. This has made the Hegemony the most stable major power in the known world—and therefore a potential threat to every other power struggling with post-Passing chaos.

# Part One: Nature & Structure

## The Dragons

Six great dragons are known to rule in the southern territories. Each commands a distinct domain and dragon-kin population:

| Dragon                           | Domain                      | Character                | Status                                               |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Pyrrathax the Eternal Flame**  | Fire, volcanoes, smithing   | Demanding, perfectionist | Most active in external affairs                      |
| **Viridantha the Endless Green** | Forests, growth, poison     | Patient, calculating     | Cultivates agents for long-term plans                |
| **Crystallux the Faceted**       | Gems, light, wealth         | Vain, collecting         | Interested in artifacts and treasures                |
| **Umbravex the Shrouded**        | Shadows, secrets, death     | Cryptic, ancient         | Rarely interacts; when it does, significance follows |
| **Tempestrix the Storm Crown**   | Weather, seas, warfare      | Volatile, martial        | Commands the Hegemony's military                     |
| **Terravox the Deep Root**       | Earth, mountains, endurance | Slow, immovable          | Provides stability to Hegemony infrastructure        |

**Dragon Nature:**
The great dragons are not beasts—they are ancient powers, possibly older than the Seven Sisters themselves. They do not think as mortals think. Their timescales are geological. Their plans may span centuries. What humans experience as history, dragons experience as recent events.

## The Dragon-Kin

The dragon-kin are humans (and others) transformed over generations to serve draconic masters. The transformation is both magical and biological:

**Types of Dragon-Kin:**

| Type         | Nature                               | Role                                 |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| **Voices**   | Most transformed; partially draconic | Speakers and ambassadors for dragons |
| **Scales**   | Marked with dragon essence           | Administrators and enforcers         |
| **Touched**  | Lightly transformed                  | Skilled laborers and soldiers        |
| **Servants** | Unchanged humans in dragon territory | Base population                      |

The degree of transformation correlates with closeness to draconic power. Voices may have visible draconic features—scaled skin, slitted eyes, unusual coloring. Scales bear marks indicating their patron dragon. The Touched show subtler changes. Servants are ordinary humans who serve the Hegemony without personal transformation.

## Hegemony Structure

```
The Great Dragons (Ultimate authority)
    ↓
Dragon Voices (Speak for their dragon)
    ↓
High Scales (Administer major territories)
    ↓
Scales (Regional administration)
    ↓
The Touched (Local authority)
    ↓
Servants (General population)
```

**Coordination:**
The six dragons don't frequently cooperate—each pursues its own agenda—but they maintain agreements that prevent conflict between their domains. When united action is needed, the Voices convene to negotiate terms.

# Part Two: Key Figures

## 1. Voice Pyrros of the Eternal Flame

| Attribute | Value                                                  |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Title** | Voice of Pyrrathax, First Ambassador to the Empire     |
| **Role**  | Primary interface between Hegemony and Imperial powers |
| **Age**   | Unknown (appears 40; likely much older)                |

**Character:** Pyrros is the public face of the Dragon-Kin Hegemony to the Empire. He's served as ambassador for decades—perhaps longer; dragon-touched lifespans are uncertain. He maintains residences in several Imperial cities, observes surface politics with detached amusement, and reports everything to his master.

He appears human at first glance, then disturbingly less so on closer observation. His skin has a faint bronze sheen. His eyes hold reflected fire. His movements are too precise, as if calculated rather than natural. He's unfailingly polite, impeccably informed, and fundamentally alien.

He finds the Empire's chaos entertaining. So much drama over such small matters. Dragons take longer views. The Passing was significant, but the dragons have endured worse. They're interested in what emerges from the wreckage.

**Goal:** To advance Pyrrathax's interests in the post-Passing world, whatever those interests are.

**Complication:** Pyrros has been Voice for so long that he's not entirely sure where Pyrrathax ends and he begins. He experiences echoes of draconic thought, vast perspectives that dwarf his human origins. He's not sure if he's still a person or merely an extension. He's not sure it matters.

## 2. Scale-Captain Viridia Thornborn

| Attribute | Value                                       |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Title** | Scale-Captain of the Green Expeditions      |
| **Role**  | Field commander for Viridantha's operations |
| **Age**   | 34 (appears)                                |

**Character:** Viridia commands Viridantha's agents in foreign territories—the network of spies, cultivated assets, and planted operatives that serves the Endless Green's long-term schemes. She's effective, ruthless, and devoted to her dragon.

Unlike Pyrros's public presence, Viridia works in shadows. She cultivates relationships that may not bear fruit for generations. She plants ideas that will influence decisions decades hence. She thinks in Viridantha's timescales, even though her life is short by dragon standards.

She's currently focused on the Church's fracturing. Viridantha believes the post-Passing spiritual chaos offers opportunity. If the right people could be guided toward the right positions, the resulting Empire might be more amenable to Hegemony interests.

**Goal:** To execute Viridantha's plans, whatever they require.

**Complication:** Viridia has discovered that Viridantha's plans require her death—she's meant to be captured and martyred to create sympathy for a particular faction. She's known this since she was assigned. She's struggling with whether her devotion extends to accepting this fate, or whether self-preservation might be legitimate for the first time in her service.

## 3. Emissary Crystallus Gemheart

| Attribute | Value                                |
| --------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Title** | Acquisition Emissary for Crystallux  |
| **Role**  | Collector of treasures and artifacts |
| **Age**   | 45                                   |

**Character:** Crystallus serves Crystallux the Faceted, the dragon obsessed with collecting beautiful and powerful objects. His job is acquiring such objects through whatever means work: purchase, trade, theft, or more creative approaches.

He's charming, knowledgeable, and genuinely appreciates the things he collects—even as he removes them from their owners to feed his dragon's hoard. He doesn't see this as theft; Crystallux is simply the proper owner of beautiful things. Temporary human possession is merely storage until the dragon's agent arrives.

His current focus is post-Passing artifacts—objects touched by the catastrophe in ways that give them unusual properties. He's particularly interested in anything connected to the realm-field damage, though he won't say why.

**Goal:** To acquire everything valuable that exists, eventually.

**Complication:** Crystallus has begun to feel things Crystallux doesn't include in his parameters. An antique loom he was sent to acquire belongs to an elderly weaver whose family made it generations ago. His parameters say acquire it. His... feelings?... say something else. He's confused by the experience.

# Part Three: Goals & Tensions

## Primary Goal

**Strategic Positioning**

The Hegemony's primary goal is positioning itself to benefit from the Empire's current chaos. This doesn't necessarily mean conquest—dragons think in longer terms. It might mean influence, dependency relationships, territorial adjustments, or simply weakening potential rivals.

## Secondary Goals

- **Intelligence:** Understand what caused the Passing and its implications
- **Acquisition:** Collect valuable objects, knowledge, and potentially people
- **Influence:** Place assets in positions to shape post-Passing developments
- **Expansion:** Extend Hegemony reach where opportunity permits

## Internal Tensions

### Inter-Dragon Competition
The six dragons pursue different agendas. Their agents sometimes work at cross-purposes. Hegemony unity is maintained by agreements, not shared vision.

### Nature of Service
Some dragon-kin embrace their transformation; others resent it. The question of what dragon-service means—willing partnership or sophisticated slavery—is not openly discussed.

### Human Connections
Dragon-kin who spend time among humans sometimes develop human attachments. These are complications their dragons don't understand and don't tolerate.

## External Tensions

### Imperial Suspicion
Everyone knows the Hegemony is positioning itself. No one knows exactly how. Trust is impossible.

### Church Hostility
The Church considers dragon-worship idolatry. Dragon-kin are seen as demon-touched. Relations are hostile at best.

### Racial Complications
The Goleuwyr and Urkhani predate dragon influence in this region. Their status vis-à-vis the Hegemony is complex.

# Part Four: Assets & Resources

## Material Resources

| Resource                    | Status     | Notes                                  |
| --------------------------- | ---------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Dragonlands Territories** | Vast       | Stable, productive, unified            |
| **Dragon Hoards**           | Legendary  | Wealth accumulated over millennia      |
| **Military Forces**         | Formidable | Tempestrix commands significant armies |
| **Magical Resources**       | Extensive  | Dragons are magical creatures          |

## Unique Capabilities

**Dragon Magic:** The great dragons are among the most powerful magical beings in existence. Their agents can call upon fragments of this power:
- Fire manipulation (Pyrrathax)
- Growth and poison (Viridantha)
- Crystal and light (Crystallux)
- Shadow and death (Umbravex)
- Storm and warfare (Tempestrix)
- Earth and endurance (Terravox)

**Transformation:** The dragons can transform those who serve them, granting abilities but also binding loyalty.

## Intelligence Networks

**Viridantha's Cultivations:** Agents planted years or decades ago, activated when useful.

**Pyrros's Observations:** Decades of observed Imperial politics, carefully catalogued.

**Trade Networks:** Crystallux's acquisition agents have access everywhere valuable things are exchanged.

| Faction                 | Relationship        | Notes                                  |
| ----------------------- | ------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Regency Council**     | Officially Neutral  | Suspicious of Hegemony intentions      |
| **Church Hierarchy**    | Hostile             | "Idol worshippers" and "demon-touched" |
| **Trading Houses**      | Commercial          | Money matters more than species        |
| **Shiranui Consortium** | Competitive         | Both expanding during chaos            |
| **Goleuwyr**            | Historical Conflict | Elves remember dragon wars             |
| **Northern Jarls**      | Minimal Contact     | Geography separates                    |

# Part Six: Adventure Hooks

## 1. Crystallux's Prize

**Situation:** Crystallus Gemheart has learned of an artifact in the Crown Lands—something touched by the Passing in a way that makes it extremely valuable to Crystallux. He's willing to pay well for acquisition assistance. The current owner doesn't want to sell.

**The Question:** Should the artifact be acquired? What does the dragon want it for? And what happens when the owner resists?

**Complications:**
- The owner has legitimate attachment to the artifact
- The artifact may have properties neither party fully understands
- Crystallux's intentions for it are unknown
- The acquisition team becomes implicated in whatever follows
- Other factions may also want the artifact

## 2. Viridia's Choice

**Situation:** Scale-Captain Viridia knows she's meant to die for Viridantha's plan. She's reached out secretly to potential allies—people who might help her escape her dragon's design. But escape means betraying everything she was raised to serve.

**The Question:** Should Viridia be helped? What would it mean to defy a dragon? And is her information about the Endless Green's plans valuable enough to risk the dragon's attention?

**Complications:**
- Viridia may be running a deeper game on behalf of Viridantha
- Helping her makes enemies of the dragon and its other agents
- Her information about dragon plans is genuinely valuable
- Escape routes from dragon service may not exist
- She may change her mind and resume obedience

## 3. The Dragon's Offer

**Situation:** Pyrros approaches influential parties with an offer: Pyrrathax is willing to provide assistance to the Empire's current struggles—stability, resources, expertise—in exchange for considerations. The offer is tempting. The cost is unclear.

**The Question:** Should dragon assistance be accepted? What are the dragons actually offering? And what do they want in return?

**Complications:**
- Dragon help would be genuinely useful
- Dragon conditions are probably long-term and binding
- Accepting makes the Empire somewhat dependent on Hegemony
- Refusing may seem foolish in retrospect if problems worsen
- Other factions will have opinions about dragon involvement

## 4. The Untransformed

**Situation:** A group of Servants—ordinary humans within Hegemony territory—have escaped to the Empire, claiming asylum. They describe life under dragon rule as slavery with pretty decorations. The Hegemony wants them returned; they're technically property. Protecting them means conflict with the dragons.

**The Question:** Should the refugees receive asylum? Is their description of dragon rule accurate? And what responsibility does the Empire have for people beyond its borders?

**Complications:**
- The refugees' claims may be accurate, exaggerated, or planted disinformation
- Protecting them antagonizes powerful neighbors
- Some refugees may be dragon agents playing a longer game
- The Empire's own treatment of non-humans is hardly exemplary
- Sending them back may condemn them to punishment
