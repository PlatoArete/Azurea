| **Type**            | Political                                                                              |
| **Status**          | Fragmented                                                                             |

| **Primary Base**    | Decentralized; major seats include Fjordhavn, Nordgard, Isheim                         |
| **Symbol/Heraldry** | Each Jarl has distinct arms; collectively represented by a silver crown over mountains |

The Northern Jarls are the hereditary lords who govern the Empire's northern territories. They owe nominal allegiance to Imperial authority but have always maintained significant autonomy—the mountains and fjords that define their lands also protect them from central control. The Passing has transformed this customary independence into effective sovereignty.

Each Jarl now rules their territory according to local tradition, answering to no one. Some maintain Imperial law and customs. Others have reverted entirely to older Norse-influenced practices. Still others forge new arrangements—like the Fjordhavn peace with Ynys Wyllt—that would have been unthinkable before the catastrophe.

What unites them is less than what divides them. They are not a faction so much as a collection of factions, each pursuing its own interests in a region where the old rules no longer apply.

# Part One: Leadership & Hierarchy

## The Jarldoms

The North contains six major jarldoms and numerous minor holdings. Each Jarl is effectively independent, though tradition and practicality create informal hierarchy.

| Jarldom          | Seat      | Jarl              | Character                        |
| ---------------- | --------- | ----------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Fjordlands**   | Fjordhavn | Tova Storm-Singer | Maritime power; Wylltic alliance |
| **High Marches** | Nordgard  | Grimnar Ironforge | Dwarven influence; Axis Faith    |
| **Frostvales**   | Isheim    | Sven Coldheart    | Isolationist; old traditions     |
| **Storm Coast**  | Vanskerry | Astrid Stormborn  | Raider culture; aggressive       |
| **Timberlands**  | Treheim   | Erik Woodwise     | Forest resources; practical      |
| **Iron Hills**   | Ferroheim | Thora Hammerhand  | Mining; manufactures             |

## Structure Within Jarldoms

Each jarldom follows similar patterns:

```
Jarl (Hereditary lord)
    ↓
Huskarls (Personal guard and council)
    ↓
Thanes (Lesser nobles holding lands)
    ↓
Karls (Free farmers and craftspeople)
    ↓
Thralls (Bondservants; still common in some areas)
```

**The Thing System:**
Major decisions in most jarldoms require approval from the Thing—an assembly of free landholders. Jarls propose; the Thing approves (or doesn't). This limits Jarl power but also provides legitimacy for decisions made.

## Power Dynamics

**No Central Authority:**
Unlike the Imperial South with its Regency Council, the North has no unifying body. The Jarls meet occasionally at ancient gathering sites, but these assemblies reach decisions only when all parties agree—which is rare.

**Regional Alliances:**
Informal groupings exist:
- **Maritime Alliance:** Fjordlands, Storm Coast (shared sea interests)
- **Mountain Compact:** High Marches, Iron Hills (dwarven connections, mining)
- **Independent:** Frostvales, Timberlands (refuse alignment)

**External Pressure:**
What sometimes unites the Jarls is foreign threat. Imperial "reintegration" attempts, Church crusades against "pagan practices," or southern expansion would trigger collective defense. But absent external pressure, they compete freely.

# Part Two: Key Figures

## 1. Admiral Tova Storm-Singer (Jarl of Fjordlands)

*See Fjordlands Development for additional context*

| Attribute | Value                                                   |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Title** | Jarl of Fjordlands, Admiral of the Northern Fleet       |
| **Role**  | Most powerful northern lord; Wylltic alliance architect |
| **Age**   | 42                                                      |

### Character

Tova Storm-Singer inherited her title through combat when her father died fighting Reft during the Passing. She rallied the scattered defenders, organized the civilian evacuation, and counterattacked with a fury that earned her the Storm-Singer name—her battle-songs were said to call actual storms to aid her fleet.

Whether the storms actually answered or survivors simply credited her with convenient weather, the legend stuck. She's used it ruthlessly, cultivating an image of chosen warrior touched by something greater than mortal power.

Her great gamble was the Wylltic alliance. When the island raiders from Ynys Wyllt offered peace rather than more raids, most Jarls scoffed. Tova negotiated anyway, binding the Fjordlands to their former enemies through marriage, trade agreements, and mutual defense. The alliance has held for five years. It makes the Fjordlands the strongest maritime power in the North.

She's pragmatic to a fault. Tradition matters only when useful. Faith matters only when it provides advantage. Loyalty matters only when maintained. These positions make her effective and unpopular—many northerners consider her approaches dangerously unconventional.

**Appearance:** Tall, broad-shouldered, with silver-streaked dark hair worn in warrior braids. Her hands are scarred from rope and combat. Her eyes assess threats and opportunities with equal attention.

**Mannerisms:**
- Speaks plainly, almost bluntly
- Makes decisions fast, adjusts later if wrong
- Consults extensively before acting, then acts without hesitation
- Refers to the sea as "she" and speaks of it as entity

### Goal

To make the Fjordlands the dominant power in the North and position herself (or her successors) to speak for the region when dealing with southern powers.

**Immediate objectives:**
- Strengthen the Wylltic alliance through demonstrated success
- Expand maritime influence to other coastal jarldoms
- Build infrastructure that makes the Fjordlands indispensable to neighbors
- Prepare for whatever's happening with the sea (her scouts report disturbances)

### Complication

The Storm-Singer name isn't just legend. During the final battle of the Passing, something answered Tova's desperate songs. She felt the wind respond to her screaming. She saw waves rise at her command. She's never told anyone, because she doesn't understand it herself.

It's happened since—three times during storms, when she sang without thinking. The weather responded. She's convinced this is real, and equally convinced that she shouldn't use it deliberately until she understands what it means.

The völva (seeress) Yrsa has noticed. She's tried to discuss it with Tova. Tova refuses. But the power is growing, and eventually it will demand acknowledgment.

## 2. Jarl Grimnar Ironforge (High Marches)

| Attribute | Value                                                      |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Title** | Jarl of the High Marches, Keeper of the Mountain Gate      |
| **Role**  | Dwarven-human alliance administrator; Axis Faith custodian |
| **Age**   | 58                                                         |

### Character

Grimnar Ironforge is half-dwarf. His mother was human; his father was a smith of the mountain clans. He inherited both the human jarldom (from his maternal grandfather) and the respect of the dwarves (from his father's lineage). He's spent thirty years bridging two peoples who traditionally maintained careful distance.

The High Marches are where human and dwarven territories overlap. The Mountain Gate—the traditional border crossing—has been under Ironforge jurisdiction for generations. Grimnar's achievement was opening it: formalizing trade, establishing protocols, creating the frameworks that let dwarven goods reach human markets and human services reach mountain settlements.

He's a pragmatic administrator rather than a warrior. His skill is making systems work, finding compromises that everyone can accept, and ensuring that the small frictions of daily interaction don't escalate to larger conflicts. The Passing disrupted these systems; he's spent seven years rebuilding them.

He's also quietly devout in the Axis Faith—the dwarven tradition that understands the world as balanced exchanges rather than unilateral obligations. This philosophy informs his governance: every deal must benefit both parties, every cost must find corresponding value, every debt must eventually be paid.

**Appearance:** Stocky, bearded, with the broad shoulders and thick hands of someone who once worked metal. His eyes are deep-set and patient. He dresses practically, in styles that blend human and dwarven elements.

**Mannerisms:**
- Weighs words carefully before speaking
- Counts everything (literally and figuratively)
- Treats every interaction as potential negotiation
- Never promises what he can't deliver; always delivers what he promises

### Goal

To maintain the human-dwarven relationship that makes the High Marches functional, and to extend principles of balanced exchange more broadly through the North.

**Immediate objectives:**
- Restore full trade capacity through the Mountain Gate
- Mediate disputes between jarldoms before they escalate
- Strengthen Axis Faith institutions as alternative to southern Church
- Prepare for potential Church "crusade" against northern traditions

### Complication

Grimnar's son Thorfinn has converted to the Solarian Church—secretly at first, now openly. He traveled south, encountered Reformist clergy, and found their message compelling. He's returned home attempting to evangelize, which would be merely awkward if his father weren't a pillar of competing faith.

The dwarven clans are watching. If Grimnar's heir brings the Church into the High Marches, everything his father built for balance might be threatened. If Grimnar disowns his son, he loses his only direct heir and demonstrates that family means less than policy. Neither option is acceptable.

## 3. Jarl Astrid Stormborn (Storm Coast)

| Attribute | Value                                           |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Title** | Jarl of the Storm Coast, Daughter of the Waves  |
| **Role**  | Traditional warrior-lord; raider culture leader |
| **Age**   | 35                                              |

### Character

Astrid Stormborn represents everything the Empire feared about the North before it conquered the region: a warrior-lord who believes that strength is the only meaningful authority, that those who can take should take, and that the old ways—sailing, raiding, testing oneself against the sea and enemy—are superior to southern decadence.

She's not stupid. She understands that open raiding of Imperial territory would invite retaliation. But she also understands that the Empire is weak, that its attention is elsewhere, and that the boundaries between legitimate "salvage" and outright piracy are blurry enough to exploit.

Her ships "salvage" wrecks that weren't quite wrecked until her crews arrived. They "protect" merchant vessels for fees that approximate the cargo's value. They "patrol" waters in ways that occasionally result in disappeared ships whose goods mysteriously appear in Vanskerry markets.

She considers this honest work. The sea is dangerous. Those who cannot protect themselves deserve what happens. The strong survive and prosper; the weak feed the strong. This is the natural order that soft Imperial thinking has corrupted.

**Appearance:** Lean, scarred, with pale hair usually braided for fighting. Her clothing is practical; her jewelry consists of trophies from meaningful combats. Her smile is wolfish.

**Mannerisms:**
- Tests everyone she meets (physically, verbally, or through challenge)
- Respects strength; dismisses weakness
- Drinks heavily but never seems intoxicated
- Tells stories of ancestors at every opportunity

### Goal

To restore the old ways: a North that takes what it wants from the weak, that answers to no southern master, and that values demonstrated strength over inherited privilege.

**Immediate objectives:**
- Expand "salvage" operations to more prosperous waters
- Build alliance with like-minded Jarls (Frostvales has potential)
- Prepare for eventual conflict with either the Empire or the Fjordlands
- Find challenges worthy of her reputation

### Complication

Astrid's younger brother Leif was captured during a raid gone wrong and is being held in Portus Aureus. The Council of Captains is offering exchange: Leif for Astrid's promise to cease operations in their waters.

She refuses on principle. Paying ransoms encourages kidnapping. But Leif is her only living family. She's been mounting rescue attempts that have failed. She's growing desperate, which makes her more dangerous—and more vulnerable to manipulation by those who know her weakness.

# Part Three: Goals & Tensions

## Primary Goal

**Practical Independence**

Each Jarl's primary goal is maintaining their own power within their own territory. Collective action happens only when necessary for mutual defense or when opportunity benefits everyone.

## Secondary Goals

- **Imperial Recognition:** Formal acknowledgment of autonomous status (rather than nominal vassalage)
- **Trade Access:** Northern goods (timber, iron, fish, fur) need southern markets
- **Religious Freedom:** Protect traditional practices from Church persecution
- **Internal Stability:** Prevent conflicts between jarldoms from escalating to war

## Internal Tensions

### Traditionalists vs. Pragmatists
Some Jarls (Astrid, Sven Coldheart) want return to old ways—raiding, isolation, rejection of southern influence. Others (Tova, Grimnar) favor adaptation—alliances, trade, selective adoption of useful innovations. This split defines northern politics.

### Resource Competition
Fishing grounds, trade routes, timber rights, and mineral deposits create constant friction. Most disputes are settled by negotiation or Thing judgment, but some escalate.

### Religious Faction
The Axis Faith (Grimnar), the old Norse traditions (Astrid), the nature spirits (Timberlands), and the creeping Solarian Church all compete for northern souls. Religious differences map onto political divisions.

## External Tensions

### Imperial Claims
The Regency Council considers the North part of the Empire. The Jarls disagree. Eventually, someone in Aurheim will attempt to reassert authority. When that happens, the North will need unity it currently lacks.

### Church Pressure
Cardinal Draconis considers northern paganism an abomination. The Scouring has expressed interest in "cleansing" northern lands. An actual crusade would unite the Jarls—but might also devastate the region.

### The Wylltic Question
Tova's alliance with the raiders from Ynys Wyllt disturbs many. Traditionalists see it as betrayal—making peace with those who burned their grandparents' villages. Pragmatists worry about what the Wylltic actually want in return.

# Part Four: Assets & Resources

## Material Resources

| Resource          | Primary Source          | Status                                       |
| ----------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Timber**        | Timberlands             | Essential export; controlled                 |
| **Iron/Steel**    | Iron Hills              | High quality; limited quantity               |
| **Fish/Whale**    | All coastal             | Feeding the region                           |
| **Furs**          | Frostvales              | Luxury trade                                 |
| **Ships**         | Fjordlands, Storm Coast | Northern design; superior in northern waters |
| **Dwarven Goods** | High Marches            | Access via Mountain Gate                     |

## Military Capability

| Jarldom          | Forces                          | Specialty                      |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Fjordlands**   | 3,000 warriors + 40 ships       | Naval supremacy                |
| **High Marches** | 2,000 warriors + dwarven allies | Mountain warfare, quality arms |
| **Frostvales**   | 1,500 warriors                  | Winter warfare, guerrillas     |
| **Storm Coast**  | 2,500 warriors + 30 ships       | Raiding, coastal assault       |
| **Timberlands**  | 1,200 warriors                  | Forest fighting, archery       |
| **Iron Hills**   | 1,800 warriors                  | Heavy infantry, siege          |

**Combined Potential:** ~12,000 warriors; 70+ warships
**Reality:** Unified action requires unified purpose. The Jarls might field half this against a common enemy; against each other, the numbers favor whoever strikes first.

## Institutional Power

**The Thing System:** Assemblies provide legitimacy and check Jarl power. Decisions made through Things carry weight that personal orders don't.

**Trade Guilds:** Northern trading associations control key exports. They can embargo jarldoms that misbehave.

**Religious Institutions:** Temples, völva circles, and Axis Faith shrines provide cultural continuity and counsel.

# Part Five: Relationships

| Faction              | Relationship          | Notes                                     |
| -------------------- | --------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Regency Council**  | Hostile Indifference  | Claims on paper; ignored in practice      |
| **Church Hierarchy** | Hostile               | "Pagans" to be converted or crusaded      |
| **Ynys Wyllt**       | Alliance (Fjordlands) | Controversial peace                       |
| **Dwarven Clans**    | Allied (High Marches) | Mountain Gate cooperation                 |
| **Trading Houses**   | Commercial            | Timber and fish for southern goods        |
| **Each Other**       | Complex               | Shifting alliances, traditional rivalries |

# Part Six: Adventure Hooks

## 1. The Thing Dispute

**Situation:** Two jarldoms—Timberlands and Frostvales—claim the same forest valley. Decades ago, the boundary was clear; the catastrophe destroyed the marker stones. Each Jarl has called a Thing to judge the case. Both Things have ruled in their lord's favor. Armed followers are gathering.

**The Question:** Can the dispute be resolved before it becomes war? Is there evidence of the original boundary? And who benefits from the conflict escalating?

**Complications:**
- Both Jarls have legitimate claims based on different past agreements
- The valley contains something both want (timber? spirits? minerals?)
- Outside parties (Church? Trading houses?) might be encouraging conflict
- Neutral arbitration requires an arbiter both sides accept
- The local population doesn't care which Jarl rules but does care about not dying

## 2. The Wylltic Secret

**Situation:** Tova Storm-Singer's Wylltic alliance depends on a secret agreement: in exchange for peace, the Fjordlands provide certain services to the raiders from Ynys Wyllt. What those services are, only Tova and the Wylltic leaders know. Now someone is threatening to reveal the terms unless Tova pays substantial blackmail.

**The Question:** What did Tova promise? Who's blackmailing her? And what happens to the alliance if the truth emerges?

**Complications:**
- The Wylltic terms might be reasonable (shelter, supplies) or disturbing (something else)
- The blackmailer might be a political rival, a Church agent, or a Wylltic faction
- Paying invites more demands; refusing risks exposure
- The alliance has brought peace—destroying it would renew raiding
- Tova's other secrets (the storm-calling) might also become exposed

## 3. The Mountain Gate Closing

**Situation:** The dwarven clans are threatening to close the Mountain Gate—sealing the border between human and dwarven territories. They cite "treaty violations" by human merchants. Grimnar Ironforge is trying to determine what actually happened, who's responsible, and whether the closure can be prevented.

**The Question:** What did the merchants do? Can it be remedied? And is someone deliberately sabotaging human-dwarven relations?

**Complications:**
- The dwarves' complaint is legitimate but disproportionate response suggests other motives
- The responsible merchants have politically powerful patrons
- Closing the Gate would devastate High Marches economy
- Church agents have reasons to disrupt the Axis Faith's influence
- Dwarven internal politics may be the real driver

## 4. The Crusade Rumor

**Situation:** Reports suggest Cardinal Draconis is advocating a "Northern Crusade" to convert or eliminate northern paganism. The Jarls are debating response: Astrid wants pre-emptive strikes; Grimnar wants diplomacy; Tova wants to wait for more information. An agent needs to travel south and determine the actual threat level.

**The Question:** Is the crusade real? How imminent? And can anything be done to prevent it?

**Complications:**
- Crusade rumors might be planted by parties who benefit from northern unity (or disunity)
- The Church's actual intentions are hard to determine from outside
- Actions to prepare for crusade might provoke one
- The Jarls' disagreements about response could become public weakness
- Southern allies (Trading Houses) might or might not help, depending on benefit
