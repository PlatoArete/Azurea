# Overview

| Attribute           | Value                                                           |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Type**            | Political/Economic                                              |
| **Status**          | Active                                                          |
| **Scope**           | Regional (Golden Coast)                                         |
| **Primary Base**    | Portus Aureus (The Golden Port)                                 |
| **Symbol/Heraldry** | A golden anchor beneath five stars — one for each Great Captain |

The Council of Captains is the de facto government of the Golden Coast, formed from surviving merchant families and ship captains after the Empire's collapse. What began as an emergency committee has become the region's permanent authority—not because anyone planned it, but because no one could agree on anything better.

The Council represents the most successful post-Passing governance: pragmatic, commercial, and fundamentally focused on keeping trade alive. While the Heartland debates succession and the Church fractures over doctrine, the Golden Coast ships goods, collects taxes, and survives. Their model may be the Empire's future—if the old powers don't destroy it first.

# Part One: Leadership & Hierarchy

## Structure

The Council is a compromise institution, designed to prevent any single faction from dominance while maintaining enough cohesion to function. It combines aristocratic, commercial, military, and foreign interests in balanced tension.

**Council Composition:**

| Seat           | Holder                  | Constituency                              |
| -------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| First Captain  | Aurelia Caela           | House Caelum (largest trading house)      |
| Second Captain | Marcus Petronius        | House Petronia (shipbuilding interests)   |
| Third Captain  | Helena Varro            | House Varro (salt and preservation trade) |
| Fourth Captain | Quintus Marinus         | House Marina (fishing fleets)             |
| Fifth Captain  | Lucius Fortunatus       | House Fortuna (glass trade)               |
| Harbor Master  | Decimus Portius         | Port infrastructure                       |
| The Admiral    | Marcus Severinus        | Naval forces                              |
| Guild Speaker  | Cornelia Fabrica        | Lesser merchants and craftspeople         |
| Foreign Consul | Mei Ling-Feng (current) | International trade partners              |

**Decision Making:**

| Category         | Requirement     | Examples                                     |
| ---------------- | --------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Routine Commerce | Simple majority | Tariff adjustments, berth assignments        |
| Military Action  | Two-thirds      | Fleet deployments, defensive measures        |
| Constitutional   | Unanimous       | Changing Council structure, war declarations |

## Power Dynamics

The Great Captains hold real power. The other seats provide legitimacy and specialized function, but meaningful decisions are made when the five major houses agree—which is rare.

**House Conflicts:**
- Caelum vs. Petronia: Competition for eastern trade routes
- Varro vs. Marina: Disputes over fishing rights in salt-preservation waters
- Fortuna vs. everyone: Glass monopoly makes them resented but necessary
- All vs. Admiral: Military force is needed but feared

**The Balance:** The Council works because everyone needs it to. The Admiral has ships but needs merchant money. The merchants have gold but need naval protection. The guilds have labor but need both. The Foreign Consul provides eastern access but needs local acceptance.

Break this balance, and the Golden Coast fragments into warring factions. Everyone knows this. Everyone watches for advantage anyway.

# Part Two: Key Figures

## 1. First Captain Aurelia Caela

| Attribute | Value                                              |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Title** | First Captain of the Council, Head of House Caelum |
| **Role**  | De facto leader, eastern trade controller          |
| **Age**   | 52                                                 |

### Character

Aurelia Caela rose to lead House Caelum after the Passing killed her father and three brothers in a single week—plague took two, a ship lost at sea took one, and grief finished her father. She inherited the largest trading house on the Golden Coast not through ambition but through being the last one standing.

She's adapted with terrifying efficiency. Within months of taking control, she'd consolidated her house's assets, negotiated new terms with Shiranui partners, eliminated two competitors through strategic acquisition, and positioned herself as first among equals on the nascent Council. Her colleagues respect her competence and fear her ruthlessness. They're right to do both.

Caela is not cruel, but she is calculating. Every relationship is assessed for value. Every decision is weighed against long-term positioning. She takes no pleasure in hard choices—she simply makes them, because someone has to, and she's the one capable.

**Appearance:** Tall, silver-haired, dressed in understated elegance that signals wealth without flaunting it. Her eyes miss nothing. Her expression rarely betrays her thoughts.

**Mannerisms:**
- Listens more than she speaks
- Never commits to a position until she's heard all others
- Maintains perfect composure under pressure
- Keeps detailed records of every conversation

### Goal

To ensure the Golden Coast survives—as an independent power if the Empire fails, as a loyal province if it recovers, as an eastern partner if neither works. She's positioning for all outcomes simultaneously.

**Immediate objectives:**
- Maintain eastern trade primacy against competing houses
- Keep the Council functional despite internal rivalries
- Build food and material reserves for leverage
- Prevent any single faction from achieving dominance

### Complication

Her daughter Lucia wants to marry a Shiranui merchant prince and relocate permanently east. This is personally painful—Lucia is her only surviving child—but also strategically complex. The alliance would secure eastern trade for generations. It would also mean binding House Caelum to foreign interests in ways that might compromise Imperial loyalty.

Caela hasn't decided. She's spent a lifetime making hard decisions, but this one touches places she's learned to protect. Every day Lucia asks for an answer. Every day Caela delays, and wonders if waiting will cost her everything.

## 2. Admiral Marcus Severinus

| Attribute | Value                                                       |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Title** | Admiral of the Eastern Fleet, Protector of the Golden Coast |
| **Role**  | Naval commander, military authority                         |
| **Age**   | 52                                                          |

### Character

Marcus Severinus is a career naval officer who rose through merit in an institution where birth usually mattered more. He commanded the Imperial Navy's eastern squadron before the Passing and held his forces together when everything else collapsed. His fleet—what remains of it—is the only military force capable of projecting power along the Golden Coast.

He's loyal to the Empire, or what he believes the Empire should be. He serves the Council because legitimate Imperial authority doesn't exist here anymore, and someone has to maintain order. But he'd return to Imperial command in a heartbeat if genuine authority emerged. This creates tension: the Council needs him, but can never fully trust him.

Severinus is protective of his people to a fault. He considers his sailors and marines family. He won't waste their lives on foolish ventures or political games. This makes him cautious—sometimes too cautious—but also earns fierce loyalty from those he commands.

**Appearance:** Weathered, scarred, perpetually squinting from years watching horizons. He wears his fleet uniform to every Council meeting—a statement of identity and reminder of what he represents.

**Mannerisms:**
- Speaks bluntly, sometimes offensively
- References naval precedent for everything
- Distrusts civilian cleverness
- Checks weather before making decisions

### Goal

To maintain an effective naval force capable of protecting the Golden Coast until legitimate Imperial authority returns to restore proper order.

**Immediate objectives:**
- Protect shipping lanes from pirates and raiders
- Prevent political use of naval power
- Rebuild fleet to full strength
- Prepare for threats no one else takes seriously

### Complication

Severinus followed orders during the old regime. Some of those orders were wrong—suppression of communities, enforcement of laws that protected the powerful. He tells himself he was just following orders. He's not sure that excuse will be enough if the old order returns, or if he wants it to.

More pressingly, his scouts have reported disturbing phenomena in eastern waters. Ships arriving with no crew. Strange lights beneath the surface. The Ti-Abzu asking for meetings they've never requested before. Something is wrong with the sea, and Severinus may be the only one taking it seriously.

## 3. Mei Ling-Feng

| Attribute | Value                                                                   |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Title** | Senior Factor of the Shiranui Consortium, Foreign Consul to the Council |
| **Role**  | Eastern trade representative, foreign influence                         |
| **Age**   | 50s (deliberately vague)                                                |

### Character

Mei Ling-Feng has lived in Portus Aureus for thirty years—longer than some Council members have been alive. She speaks Imperial Latin flawlessly, knows local trading law better than most lawyers, and maintains connections to every faction that matters. She's become indispensable: the only reliable connection to eastern trade.

The Consortium selected her for this posting because of her ability to bridge cultures. She's done it so successfully that she no longer entirely belongs to either. Shiranui feels foreign when she visits home. Portus Aureus will never accept a Shiranui as truly local. She exists in the space between, belonging everywhere and nowhere.

She's also caught between conflicting loyalties. The Consortium's orders have become increasingly aggressive—they see opportunity in the Empire's collapse. She sees the danger of overreach, the backlash that would destroy everything she's built. She's implementing orders in ways that minimize harm, but the margin for maneuver is narrowing.

**Appearance:** Elegant, ageless, dressed in a blend of eastern and western fashions that marks her hybrid identity. Her expression is serene; her eyes are calculating.

**Mannerisms:**
- Speaks slowly and precisely
- Never shows surprise or strong emotion publicly
- Uses silence as a negotiating tool
- Pours tea during difficult conversations

### Goal

To maintain and expand Shiranui's trading position while preserving the relationships that make trade possible. She's trying to serve two masters and keep both happy.

**Immediate objectives:**
- Keep eastern trade flowing despite disruption
- Protect Shiranui citizens in the chaos
- Expand influence without triggering backlash
- Prepare exit routes for inevitable disaster

### Complication

Her orders now include destabilization activities: supporting factions that will create dependency on Shiranui, gathering intelligence for future leverage, positioning for eventual dominance. She's been implementing these orders carefully, choosing the least destructive interpretations.

But the Consortium is sending an inspector—ostensibly to assist, actually to evaluate. If he finds her insufficiently aggressive, she'll be replaced. If he doesn't, his own activities might trigger the backlash she's trying to prevent. She has weeks to decide what to do about him.

# Part Three: Goals & Tensions

## Primary Goal

**Trade Continuity**

Above everything else, the Council exists to keep trade flowing. Ships must sail. Goods must move. Commerce must continue. This isn't purely mercenary—trade is what feeds the population, maintains civilization, and provides the resources for everything else. Without trade, the Golden Coast dies.

## Secondary Goals

- **Maintain Autonomy:** The Council wants neither Aurheim nor Vandgwyn controlling their affairs
- **Expand Market Share:** The Empire's collapse creates opportunities for those positioned to take them
- **Secure Food Supply:** The Coast can't feed itself; it needs imports or production elsewhere
- **Build Naval Power:** Protection requires ships; ships require resources the Council wants to control

## Internal Tensions

### House Rivalries
The five Great Captains are competitors before they're colleagues. Each house seeks advantage against the others. Agreements in Council are often undermined by private arrangements. The unity required for effective governance is always fragile.

### Military-Civilian Divide
The Admiral controls the only significant military force. The merchants control the money. Neither trusts the other. Severinus believes the merchants are shortsighted and selfish. The merchants believe Severinus might stage a coup if sufficiently provoked.

### The Eastern Question
Should the Golden Coast orient toward the Empire (with its traditions and legitimacy) or toward Shiranui (with its stability and trade)? Older families favor Imperial loyalty. Younger merchants favor eastern partnership. The debate has no resolution because no one knows how the larger situation will develop.

## External Tensions

### Imperial Claims
Both Aurheim and Vandgwyn consider the Golden Coast an Imperial province. The Council acknowledges nominal Imperial authority while ignoring it in practice. Eventually, someone will try to enforce those claims.

### Shiranui Pressure
The Consortium sees opportunity in Imperial weakness. Their demands grow more aggressive. Resistance risks losing eastern trade. Compliance risks losing independence.

### The Sea Is Changing
Something is wrong in the eastern waters. Ships vanish. The Ti-Abzu are frightened. Fishing grounds have shifted. The Council has been too focused on politics to address something that might be far more dangerous.

# Part Four: Assets & Resources

## Material Resources

| Resource                | Status                 | Notes                                       |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Trading Fleets**      | Reduced but functional | About 60% of pre-Passing capacity           |
| **Port Infrastructure** | Maintained             | The harbor is the Council's primary asset   |
| **Warehoused Goods**    | Strategic reserves     | Grain, salt, luxury goods held for leverage |
| **Currency Reserves**   | Substantial            | Gold and silver from trade surpluses        |
| **Glass Production**    | Monopoly               | Portus Vitrum supplies the region           |
| **Salt Production**     | Essential              | Portus Salis maintains supply               |

## Institutional Power

**Trade Control:** The harbors, warehouses, exchange, and weighing house give the Council control over commerce. Nothing significant moves without their knowledge and permission.

**The Merchant Courts:** Disputes are resolved by Council-appointed arbiters. This legal authority is as important as military force.

**Guild Dependencies:** The guilds provide skilled labor and enforce quality standards. They're technically independent but practically interdependent with the Council.

## Military/Enforcement Capability

| Force         | Size                     | Notes                             |
| ------------- | ------------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| Eastern Fleet | 12 warships (8 reserves) | Controlled by Admiral Severinus   |
| Harbor Guard  | ~600                     | Port security, Council controlled |
| House Guards  | ~2,000 total             | Private forces of Great Captains  |
| Guild Militia | ~3,000                   | Available in emergencies          |

**Naval dominance** is the Council's real power. They can blockade rivals, protect shipping, and project force along the coast.

## Knowledge & Secrets

**Eastern Intelligence:** Mei Ling-Feng provides information about Shiranui that no one else can access. This is valuable and dangerous—her loyalties are uncertain.

**Undersea Contacts:** The Ti-Abzu and Abgal-Tako occasionally trade with surface merchants. Someone on the Council knows more about what's happening beneath the waves than they're admitting.

**Missing Ships:** The Council is suppressing information about vessels that arrived without crews. Panic would disrupt trade.

# Part Five: Relationships

| Faction                 | Relationship       | Notes                                         |
| ----------------------- | ------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Regency Council**     | Nominal Vassals    | Acknowledge Imperial authority; ignore it     |
| **Church Hierarchy**    | Tolerated          | Church presence weak here; commerce first     |
| **Shiranui Consortium** | Essential Partners | Mutual dependency; mutual suspicion           |
| **Guilds**              | Controlled         | Council depends on them; guilds know it       |
| **Ti-Abzu**             | Curious            | Recent contact requests are unprecedented     |
| **The Goleuwyr**        | Quietly Tolerant   | Hidden enclaves persist; Council ignores them |

# Part Six: Adventure Hooks

## 1. The Empty Ships

**Situation:** Three Shiranui trading vessels have arrived without crews in recent months. Cargo intact, personal effects undisturbed, no signs of violence or distress. The ships apparently sailed themselves into harbor. The Council wants quiet investigation before word spreads.

**The Question:** What's taking the crews? Is it affecting all ships or only certain routes? Can it be stopped before the eastern trade collapses?

**Complications:**
- The Consortium wants their own investigation (which might reveal uncomfortable truths)
- Survivors may exist somewhere
- The phenomenon may be spreading toward the harbor itself
- Admiral Severinus suspects the undersea peoples know something

## 2. The Undersea Embassy

**Situation:** The Abgal-Tako have requested a meeting at the Amber Wreck—neutral ground they declared sacred. This is unprecedented; the cephalopod sages never seek surface contact. They've asked for representatives who can "breathe between worlds."

**The Question:** What do the Tako want? What knowledge are they willing to share? And what will they demand in return?

**Complications:**
- Attending requires surviving at sixty feet underwater
- Multiple Council factions want to control the contact
- The Tako's goals may conflict with human interests
- Whatever they know about the sea's changes might be terrifying

## 3. The Inheritance War

**Situation:** Gaius Navalis, a wealthy merchant, died leaving a massive trading fortune and no clear heir. Three claimants have emerged with conflicting documentation. The dispute threatens to split one of the great trading houses and destabilize Council politics.

**The Question:** Who is the legitimate heir? Or if legitimacy can't be established, who should inherit for the good of the city?

**Complications:**
- Each claimant has armed supporters and political backing
- Some evidence may be forged—but which?
- The merchant's fortune includes secrets someone wants buried
- External powers might benefit from a prolonged dispute

## 4. The Consortium Inspector

**Situation:** Mei Ling-Feng learns that the Shiranui Consortium is sending an inspector to evaluate operations—and to implement more aggressive expansion policies. If the inspector succeeds, everything Mei has built will be at risk. If he fails, so is she.

**The Question:** Can the inspector be managed, diverted, or removed without destroying the eastern trade relationship?

**Complications:**
- The inspector has authority Mei cannot openly challenge
- His activities might trigger the backlash Mei fears
- Helping Mei means choosing sides in Shiranui internal politics
- The Consortium's long-term plans for the Golden Coast are concerning
