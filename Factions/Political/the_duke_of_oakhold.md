The Duke of Oakhold is technically a provincial noble like any other—one of several dukes holding territory from the Emperor, subordinate to the Regency Council, part of the Imperial aristocratic hierarchy. In practice, Oakhold has always been different: the duchy sits at the edge of the Great Forest, and its lord's first obligation has always been managing the relationship between human settlement and the vast, primordial woodland that defines the western Empire.

The current Duke, Edmund Oakenshield, is the latest of a line that has held this position for twenty generations. His ancestors learned how to negotiate with the forest—quite literally, through Alysian practitioners who served as intermediaries with the land spirits. This knowledge has made Oakhold essential and has given its rulers latitude that other nobles don't enjoy.

Since the Passing disrupted both the forest and the political order, Oakhold has become more important and more dangerous. The forest is angry; the Duke is its primary spokesman to the human world.

# Part One: The Duchy

## The Territory

Oakhold controls the human territories at the Great Forest's eastern edge—a band of semi-cleared land where civilization meets wilderness:

| Area                   | Character                              | Status                   |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| **Forest Edge**        | Mixed settlement and woodland          | Active negotiation zone  |
| **The Clearings**      | Agricultural areas wrested from forest | Contested                |
| **Oakhold Town**       | Ducal capital, largest settlement      | Stable                   |
| **The Timber Roads**   | Logging routes into forest             | Increasingly dangerous   |
| **The Deep Interface** | Where Goleuwyr territory begins        | Hidden Goleuwyr presence |

**The Great Forest:**
The forest itself is not Duke's territory—it's its own thing, inhabited by spirits, Goleuwyr, and stranger things. The Duke's role is managing the edge, not claiming the interior.

## The Ducal Role

The Duke of Oakhold has unique obligations:

**Forest Steward:**
- Negotiating with forest spirits through Alysian intermediaries
- Maintaining agreements about what humans can take
- Responding when the forest is angry about violations
- Representing human interests to the green world

**Conservative Sanctuary:**
- Protecting old ways that the Church has suppressed elsewhere
- Maintaining relationships with Goleuwyr (unofficially)
- Sheltering folk practitioners the Inquisition would target
- Preserving knowledge about the land spirits

**Political Buffer:**
- Representing the forest's interests in Imperial politics
- Preventing exploitation that would anger the woodland
- Explaining to the Regency why certain things can't be done
- Absorbing demands from resource-hungry factions

# Part Two: Leadership

## Key Figures

### Duke Edmund Oakenshield

| Attribute | Value                                     |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Title** | Duke of Oakhold, Lord of the Forest Edge  |
| **Role**  | Hereditary ruler; forest-human negotiator |
| **Age**   | 61                                        |

**Character:** Edmund has held the duchy for thirty-two years—through the old Emperor's decline, through the succession crisis, through the Passing and its aftermath. He's watched his ancestors' careful centuries of balance come under increasing pressure.

He understands his role with unusual clarity: he's not the forest's owner but its ambassador. His family's power comes from being essential to both sides—too valuable for humans to remove, too necessary for the forest to destroy. This position requires constant calibration.

Since the Passing, the forest has become difficult. The spirits that should be cooperative are hostile; the agreements that should hold are straining. Edmund's spending more time in negotiation than governance, and the negotiations aren't going well.

He's aware of the Goleuwyr in his territory. He protects them from exposure not from friendship but from understanding: they're part of the forest's ecology, and harming them would anger the woodland. This pragmatic protection has earned him cautious elven trust.

**Goal:** To maintain the forest-human balance through the current crisis, preserving both his duchy and the ancient agreements.

**Complication:** Edmund's only heir, his daughter Roswitha, has little interest in the forest-steward role. She's drawn to the capital, to politics, to the power games that Edmund has always found trivial. If she inherits without understanding her obligations, twenty generations of careful work could collapse.

### Lady Roswitha Oakenshield

| Attribute | Value                                  |
| --------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Title** | Lady of Oakhold; Heir Presumptive      |
| **Role**  | Duke's daughter and eventual successor |
| **Age**   | 28                                     |

**Character:** Roswitha is intelligent, ambitious, and profoundly bored with forest management. She's spent time at the Imperial court, cultivated connections with the major factions, and developed political skills her father never valued. She wants to matter on the Empire's stage, not spend her life talking to trees.

She sees her father's role as provincial and limiting. Yes, the forest matters, but the real power is in Aurheim. She wants to be a player in Imperial politics, not a glorified park ranger.

She's not wrong that her skills could be valuable in the capital. She is wrong that the forest can be managed with less attention. Her occasional visits home feature arguments with her father about priorities.

**Goal:** To expand Oakhold's influence beyond provincial matters into Imperial politics.

**Complication:** Roswitha has been approached by Marcus Corbulo of the Regency Council, who sees her as a potential ally in his power consolidation. An alliance with the timber resources Oakhold controls would strengthen his position. Roswitha is tempted.

### Forest-Speaker Derwen Greenmantle

*See Alysian Tradition for additional context*

| Attribute | Value                                   |
| --------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Title** | Forest-Speaker to the Duke              |
| **Role**  | Alysian practitioner; forest negotiator |
| **Age**   | 45                                      |

**Character:** Greenmantle is the Duke's official liaison to the forest spirits—a position his family has held for eight generations. He conducts the negotiations, maintains the shrines, and performs the rituals that keep the agreements functional.

He's deeply uncomfortable with his position. He serves the Duke because the position lets him protect the forest, but he's increasingly aware that "protection" means managing the forest's exploitation rather than preventing it.

Since the Passing, his negotiations have become harder. The spirits are angry; the forest remembers injuries that should be forgotten under the agreements. Something has changed in how the green world relates to human presence.

**Goal:** To protect the forest from human exploitation while protecting humans from forest hostility.

**Complication:** Greenmantle has been receiving messages from something deep in the forest—power offering to enforce the forest's will. He hasn't accepted, but the temptation grows as negotiations fail.

# Part Three: Goals & Tensions

## Primary Goal

**Maintain the Balance**

Oakhold's essential purpose is maintaining the relationship between human settled lands and the Great Forest. Everything else—politics, economics, family—serves this goal.

## Secondary Goals

- **Protect the Duchy:** Preserve Oakhold's relative independence
- **Manage the Forest Crisis:** Address the post-Passing woodland anger
- **Secure Succession:** Ensure the next generation can continue the work
- **Preserve Old Ways:** Protect the folk traditions that make forest-negotiation possible

## Internal Tensions

### Father vs. Daughter
Edmund and Roswitha disagree about priorities. He focuses on the forest; she wants Imperial influence. Both are right about some things.

### Tradition vs. Modernity
The old ways work, but they're also limiting. Should Oakhold adapt to changing circumstances or maintain what's always functioned?

### Protection vs. Exploitation
The duchy benefits from forest products, but extraction must be balanced. Pressure for more resources creates constant friction.

## External Tensions

### Resource Demands
The Regency Council, Trading Houses, and others want timber, game, and other forest products. The forest won't accept increased extraction.

### Church Pressure
The Inquisition suspects (correctly) that Oakhold shelters folk practitioners and maintains "pagan" relationships. They'd love to investigate.

### Forest Anger
Whatever happened during the Passing, the forest is now difficult. Negotiations that should succeed are failing.

# Part Four: Adventure Hooks

## 1. The Forest's Ultimatum

**Situation:** Duke Edmund's negotiations have failed. The forest spirits are demanding something unprecedented: human withdrawal from the Clearings within one season. If refused, they'll end the ancient agreements and let the forest reclaim what it wants. Edmund needs help finding another way.

**The Question:** Can the ultimatum be negotiated? What does the forest actually want? And what happens if neither party backs down?

**Complications:**
- The Clearings feed thousands; withdrawal means famine
- The forest's demands may mask deeper issues
- Other factions will exploit the crisis
- Greenmantle's loyalty to the Duke is wavering
- The Goleuwyr might broker peace—but they're hiding

## 2. The Succession Crisis

**Situation:** Duke Edmund has collapsed—illness, overwork, something else. Roswitha must take over, but she's unprepared for the forest-negotiation role and more interested in Corbulo's political offers. Someone needs to either train her quickly or find alternatives.

**The Question:** Can Roswitha learn to be a forest-steward? Should she? And what happens to the ancient agreements if she can't or won't fulfill the role?

**Complications:**
- Roswitha's political deals may compromise forest obligations
- Greenmantle doesn't trust her
- Edmund may not recover
- Other nobles smell opportunity in Oakhold's weakness
- The forest is already angry; leadership crisis makes it worse
