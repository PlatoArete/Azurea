The Church Hierarchy is the central governing body of the Solarian Church, based in the spiritual capital of Vandgwyn. Led nominally by the Luminary (Supreme Pontiff), actual power rests with the Conclave of Flames—twelve cardinals who elect the Pontifex and determine doctrine. Since Luminary Aldric VII was broken by whatever he encountered in the Founder's Tomb, the Conclave has ruled through forged pronouncements and careful theater.

The Hierarchy increasingly asserts temporal authority as secular power fragments. They argue that legitimate governance requires religious sanction—and that a government unable to prevent catastrophe has surrendered its mandate. This brings them into direct conflict with Aurheim's Regency Council.

# Part One: Leadership & Hierarchy

## Structure

The Solarian Church is theoretically an absolute theocracy with the Luminary as God's voice on earth. In practice, the Conclave of Flames wields collective authority, constrained by tradition, precedent, and the need to maintain the appearance of unity.

**Formal Hierarchy:**
```
The Luminary (Supreme Pontiff)
    ↓
Conclave of Flames (12 Cardinals)
    ↓
Archprelates (Regional leaders)
    ↓
Prelates (City/town churches)
    ↓
Kindlers (Parish priests)
    ↓
Acolytes (Junior clergy)
```

**Parallel Structures:**
| Institution                            | Role                  | Reports To                     |
| -------------------------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Office of Sacred Purity (Inquisition)  | Investigate heresy    | Grand Adjudicator → Conclave   |
| The Great Seminary                     | Train clergy          | Rector → Conclave              |
| Holy Archives                          | Maintain records      | Archivist → Conclave           |
| Orders (Monastics, Hospitallers, etc.) | Specialized functions | Chapter Masters → Archprelates |

## Current Leadership

| Position               | Name                        | Faction                             |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Luminary               | Aldric VII                  | Incapacitated                       |
| Acting Regent          | Cardinal Augustinus Theron  | Institutionalist                    |
| Reformist Leader       | Cardinal Seraphina Valens   | Reformist                           |
| Orthodox Leader        | Cardinal Marcus Draconis    | Orthodox                            |
| Grand Adjudicator      | Vespera Noctis              | Orthodox (increasingly independent) |
| Aurheim Representative | Pontifex Lucerna Marcellina | Pragmatist                          |

## Power Dynamics

The Conclave is divided into three factions, none commanding a majority:

**Institutionalists (5 Cardinals):** Led by Theron. Their goal is to maintain the existing order—keep the Luminary's condition secret, prevent schism, change nothing dramatic. They believe the Church survives by surviving, not by reforming.

**Reformists (3 Cardinals):** Led by Valens. They believe the Passing was a wake-up call that the Church's theology is broken. They advocate acknowledging the Theosyn, reconciling with folk traditions, even dialogue with other faiths. The Orthodox consider this heresy.

**Orthodox (4 Cardinals):** Led by Draconis. They believe the Passing was punishment for insufficient piety. Their solution: more discipline, more purity, burn the heretics faster. They support the Scouring militias.

**The Math:** Any two factions can outvote the third on doctrinal matters. Institutionalists and Reformists can block Orthodox extremism. Institutionalists and Orthodox can block Reformist changes. This usually means blocking—very little actually passes.

**The Grand Adjudicator:** Vespera Noctis technically reports to the Conclave but increasingly operates independently. Her Inquisition has become a power unto itself. Draconis considers her an ally; Theron considers her a problem he can't solve; Valens considers her the primary threat. She considers herself the only one actually defending the faith.

# Part Two: Key Figures

## 1. Cardinal Augustinus Theron

| Attribute | Value                                                |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Title** | Dean of the Conclave, Acting Regent for the Holy See |
| **Role**  | De facto head of the Church                          |
| **Age**   | 71                                                   |

### Character

Augustinus Theron is the quintessential institutionalist—a man whose first instinct is always to preserve, never to change. He became senior cardinal through seniority and survival; his peers are dead, fled, or broken. He leads because no one else is acceptable to all factions, and he's less threatening than the alternatives.

Before the Passing, Theron administered the Church's finances—not the treasury itself, but the complex web of tithes, benefices, and endowments that funded clerical operations. He was competent and colorless. No scandals, no brilliance, no enemies strong enough to matter.

Now he presides over a fragmenting institution, desperately applying procedural solutions to existential problems. His strategy is to defer, delay, and deliberate until crises resolve themselves. Sometimes this works—the Church has survived worse. Sometimes it doesn't—problems fester until they become catastrophic.

He sincerely believes in God, in the Light, in the Church's mission. This faith is why he refuses to let it die on his watch. It's also why he can't adapt—admitting the Church needs fundamental reform would mean admitting everything he's served was flawed.

**Appearance:** Thin, balding, perpetually tired. Simple robes despite his rank—the contrast with Draconis's elaborate vestments is deliberate. His hands are ink-stained from endless paperwork.

**Mannerisms:**
- Speaks slowly, as if measuring each word's cost
- Never commits to a position until forced
- Refers to "the Church" rather than "we" or "I"
- Prays silently before making any significant decision

### Goal

To preserve the Solarian Church as a unified institution until... something. He doesn't have a clear vision for what comes after, only a conviction that schism is worse than any available alternative.

**Immediate objectives:**
- Maintain the Luminary fiction as long as possible
- Prevent open conflict between Reformists and Orthodox
- Keep the Inquisition nominally under Conclave control
- Avoid war with Aurheim's Regency Council

### Complication

Theron is complicit in the Luminary forgeries—the pronouncements bear seals he authorized. If this becomes public, his position is untenable. Worse, he's genuinely unsure whether the forgeries are justified. They maintain order, yes. But they're also lies. Each one chips away at his soul.

He wants to confess. To admit what they've done and accept judgment. But confession would destroy the Church—or so he tells himself. So he signs another forged pronouncement and prays for forgiveness he's not sure he deserves.

---

## 2. Cardinal Seraphina Valens

| Attribute | Value                                                    |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Title** | Cardinal-Bishop of the Southern Marches, Voice of Reform |
| **Role**  | Reformist faction leader                                 |
| **Age**   | 48                                                       |

### Character

Seraphina Valens was a controversial figure before the Passing—a reformer who questioned doctrines others considered settled, an advocate for the poor who embarrassed wealthy patrons, a woman in an institution dominated by men who treated her elevation as an experiment that might still fail.

The Passing made her essential. Someone had to articulate why the Light failed to protect its faithful. Someone had to offer answers beyond "pray harder." Valens proposed that the Church's theology was incomplete—not wrong exactly, but missing crucial truths. The Light is real, but it's not alone. The old gods are real. Folk traditions contain wisdom. Even the Dark realm serves a purpose.

This is heresy by Orthodox standards—and also the only theological framework that explains why Light-field magic has weakened since the Passing. Reality supports her arguments, which is why she hasn't been silenced. Yet.

She's charismatic, passionate, and impatient. She believes the Church has perhaps ten years before it becomes irrelevant—and another five before everything she values is destroyed. This urgency makes her push too hard, alienate potential allies, and underestimate the opposition.

**Appearance:** Striking rather than beautiful—sharp features, intense dark eyes, prematurely silver hair she no longer bothers to hide. Her vestments incorporate subtle folk symbols that would scandalize traditionalists.

**Mannerisms:**
- Speaks quickly, interrupts, finishes others' sentences
- Uses rhetorical questions to make points
- Makes eye contact aggressively
- Quotes sources the Church doesn't officially acknowledge

### Goal

To transform the Solarian Church into something that can actually address humanity's spiritual needs—a faith that incorporates the Theosyn, acknowledges the realm-fields, practices reciprocity rather than dominion, and prepares people for the next catastrophe instead of pretending the last one was an aberration.

**Immediate objectives:**
- Build Reformist presence in the Conclave
- Establish secret dialogue with non-Church traditions
- Protect clergy sympathetic to reform from Inquisition persecution
- Develop theological framework that bridges old and new understandings

### Complication

Valens has been in contact with Theosyn-worshippers—priests who remember the old gods under their "saint" disguises. She's also communicated with Alysian folk practitioners in the western regions. These contacts have been productive: she's learned things that validate her theories.

They're also evidence of heresy by current doctrine. Vespera Noctis suspects but can't prove. If proof emerges, even Theron couldn't protect her. Worse, her arrest would expose everyone she's been communicating with. She's built a network that could renew the Church—or become fuel for the Scouring's next bonfire.

## 3. Grand Adjudicator Vespera Noctis

| Attribute | Value                                            |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Title** | Grand Adjudicator of the Office of Sacred Purity |
| **Role**  | Head of the Inquisition                          |
| **Age**   | 55                                               |

### Character

Vespera Noctis believes she is the only person truly defending the faith. The cardinals are compromised—Theron by weakness, Valens by heresy, Draconis by ambition. The parish priests have lost their way. The monastics have retreated. Only the Inquisition remains true.

She joined the Office as a young idealist, determined to protect the faithful from genuine threats—cults that practiced human sacrifice, sorcerers who tortured for power, criminals who exploited religious authority. Her early career was distinguished: she dismantled three genuinely dangerous organizations and saved dozens of lives.

But the work changes those who do it. You spend years studying evil, you start seeing it everywhere. Her definition of "heresy" has expanded steadily. Questioning doctrine is heresy. Practicing folk traditions is heresy. Speaking to non-humans is heresy. Being insufficiently zealous is heresy.

Since the Passing, this expansion has accelerated. The Scouring militias—vigilante bands burning "heretics" across the countryside—operate with her tacit approval. She doesn't control them, but she defends them as necessary expressions of pious zeal.

Something else is happening to her. The investigators who work closely with accused heretics sometimes absorb what they study. Vespera has been interrogating Blood Field practitioners—and the Blood Field rewards pain. Her techniques have become more extreme. She's started cutting herself after sessions, offering the blood to "purify" what she's touched.

She doesn't realize what's happening. She thinks the power she feels is God answering her devotion.

**Appearance:** Severe, angular, always dressed in black with the silver flame-badge of her office. Her hands are scarred—she claims from a torture victim's resistance, but the pattern suggests self-infliction. Her eyes burn with conviction.

**Mannerisms:**
- Never blinks during conversation
- Speaks precisely, never raises her voice
- Refers to suspects as "the accused" regardless of evidence
- Carries a small blade she claims is ceremonial

### Goal

To purify the Church of contamination and ensure the faithful are protected from spiritual corruption—by any means necessary, against any threat, regardless of cost.

**Immediate objectives:**
- Expand Inquisition authority over secular matters
- Investigate Cardinal Valens's heretical contacts
- Bring the Scouring under formal Inquisition supervision
- Identify and eliminate Blood Field practitioners (irony unacknowledged)

### Complication

The Blood Field is claiming her. Each interrogation where pain extracts truth makes her stronger—and less recognizably human. She's begun hearing whispers that she interprets as divine guidance. She's begun enjoying her work in ways that would have horrified her younger self.

Several of her subordinates have noticed the change. One reported concerns to Cardinal Theron, who did nothing—the Grand Adjudicator is too powerful to challenge directly. Another subordinate quietly documents everything, waiting for the right moment to expose her. A third has started sharing her practices, creating a circle of Blood-touched inquisitors who believe they're holy.

When she finally falls—and she will fall—the damage may extend throughout the Office.

# Part Three: Goals & Tensions

## Primary Goal

**Temporal Authority Through Religious Legitimacy**

The Hierarchy seeks to position the Church as the ultimate arbiter of legitimate governance. In a world where secular authority has fragmented, they argue that only divine sanction can establish rightful rule. This isn't entirely self-serving—they genuinely believe orderly government requires moral foundation—but the practical effect is to make the Church a kingmaker.

## Secondary Goals

- **Conceal the Luminary's Condition:** Aldric VII's madness delegitimizes everything the Hierarchy claims
- **Prevent Schism:** The internal factions must be held together or the Church splits
- **Control the Narrative:** Historical records must support Church claims; contradictions must be suppressed
- **Maintain Revenue Streams:** Tithes and donations fund everything; they've declined since the Passing

## Internal Tensions

### The Three-Faction Stalemate
Institutionalists prevent change in either direction. Reformists and Orthodox despise each other. The Conclave can block initiatives but rarely advance them. This paralysis frustrates everyone.

### The Mad Luminary
Everyone knows; no one discusses. The forgeries maintain order but corrode moral authority. Each cardinal complicit in the deception is compromised. The secret cannot be kept forever.

### The Inquisition Problem
Vespera Noctis has become uncontrollable. The Office operates semi-independently, terrorizing populations the Church needs to retain. But confronting her risks the Orthodox faction's full opposition and potentially violent backlash from her agents.

### The Scouring Question
Militant mobs commit atrocities in the Church's name. Draconis defends them as pious zeal. Valens denounces them as monsters. Theron tries not to make a decision. The longer this continues, the more the Church becomes identified with burning people alive.

## External Tensions

### Aurheim Conflict
The Regency Council denies Vandgwyn's authority over temporal matters. The Hierarchy denies Aurheim's right to govern without Church sanction. Neither can back down. Neither can afford war. The result is escalating rhetoric and tightening sanctions.

### The Bridge
Commander Marcella's independent control of the crossing between capitals infuriates the Hierarchy. They've considered interdiction (refusing sacraments to bridge personnel) but fear she'd actually destroy the structure.

### Provincial Churches
Local priests increasingly ignore Vandgwyn's pronouncements, adapting services to what their communities need. This practical independence undermines central authority. The Inquisition can't be everywhere.

# Part Four: Assets & Resources

## Material Resources

| Resource               | Status                  | Notes                                        |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Cathedral Treasury** | Substantial             | Gold, relics, art accumulated over centuries |
| **Tithe Revenue**      | Declining               | Collections down 40% since Passing           |
| **Church Properties**  | Extensive but scattered | Buildings throughout Empire, many abandoned  |
| **The Holy Archives**  | Irreplaceable           | Records of doctrine, history, theology       |
| **The Founder's Tomb** | Sealed                  | Whatever's in there remains unexplored       |

## Institutional Power

**Sacramental Monopoly:** The Church controls access to the rites that (believers think) determine the soul's fate. Baptism, confession, last rites—all require Church-ordained priests. This power has weakened since the Passing, as people question whether the rites work.

**Educational Authority:** Most literate people learned in Church schools. The Great Seminary still trains clergy. Church scholars maintain the largest library system in the Empire.

**Diplomatic Recognition:** The Church provides the moral framework within which secular powers operate. Even those who hate it acknowledge its role.

## Military/Enforcement Capability

| Force               | Size    | Notes                                               |
| ------------------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Cathedral Guard     | ~500    | Ceremonial but trained                              |
| Inquisition Agents  | ~200    | Investigators, torturers, enforcers                 |
| Scouring Militias   | ~5,000+ | Vigilantes claiming Church sanction; not controlled |
| Hospitaller Knights | ~300    | Warrior-monks; nominally protective                 |

**Actual combat force:** ~1,000 directly controlled
**Forces claiming Church authority:** Many thousands (quality unreliable)

## Knowledge & Secrets

**The Founder's Tomb Contents:** Whatever Aldric VII found remains secret—but the fact that he found something has leaked.

**Theosyn True Names:** The Archives contain records of which "saints" are actually converted pagan gods. Publication would reshape religious understanding.

**Blood Field Documentation:** Inquisition records contain extensive information about the emergent Blood Field—enough to teach its practices as well as identify them.

**Cardinal Indiscretions:** Every cardinal has secrets the others know. Mutual blackmail prevents anyone from speaking freely.

# Part Five: Relationships

| Faction             | Relationship           | Notes                                                 |
| ------------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Regency Council** | Hostile Tension        | Competing claims to legitimate authority              |
| **The Bridge**      | Frustrated             | Can't control crossing to Aurheim                     |
| **The Scouring**    | Complicated            | Tacit Orthodox support; official ambiguity            |
| **Theosyn Revival** | Threatened By          | Old gods returning destabilizes Church claims         |
| **Folk Traditions** | Persecutory            | Inquisition targets; Reformists seek dialogue         |
| **Trading Houses**  | Transactional          | Church needs donations; merchants need respectability |
| **Goleuwyr**        | Persecutory (official) | "Soulless" doctrine; some clergy quietly dissent      |

---

# Part Six: Adventure Hooks

## 1. The Luminary's Words

**Situation:** Despite his madness, Aldric VII occasionally speaks coherent phrases. His attendants have noticed patterns: certain moon phases, certain weather conditions, the presence of specific individuals. His latest coherent utterance was: "The ninth key is beneath the white stone where three waters meet."

**The Question:** Is the mad Luminary channeling genuine prophecy? What does his message mean? And who else is trying to interpret it?

**Complications:**
- The Conclave wants the investigation kept secret
- Multiple locations fit the description
- Speaking with Aldric requires access to the most secure area in Vandgwyn
- Someone is killing people who get too close to understanding

## 2. The Reformist Network

**Situation:** Cardinal Valens needs messengers she can trust—people outside Church hierarchy who can carry communications to her network of reform-minded clergy, folk practitioners, and Theosyn-sympathizers. The Inquisition is watching normal channels.

**The Question:** Can outsiders help build a secret movement that might transform the Church—or will they expose it to destruction?

**Complications:**
- The Inquisition has infiltrated previous networks
- Not everyone in Valens's network is trustworthy
- Orthodox agents are actively hunting reformist connections
- Success creates obligations to a potentially doomed faction

## 3. Blood in the Inquisition

**Situation:** A mid-ranking Inquisition investigator has realized what's happening to Grand Adjudicator Noctis—the Blood Field corruption, the changing techniques, the circle of practitioners forming around her. He wants to expose her but knows he'll be killed if he approaches the wrong person.

**The Question:** Can the Grand Adjudicator be stopped before her corruption spreads further? And what happens to the Inquisition if she falls?

**Complications:**
- Noctis's loyalists control most of the Office
- Cardinal Draconis might protect her regardless of evidence
- Exposure could trigger an Inquisition civil war
- The informant himself may be compromised

## 4. The First Chapel

**Situation:** Something is wrong beneath the First Chapel—the structure sealed since Aldric VII emerged mad from the Founder's Tomb. Sounds have been heard. The protective wards are failing. The Conclave needs someone to investigate without officially authorizing an investigation.

**The Question:** What is in the Founder's Tomb? What did Aldric encounter? And is Solwyn still sleeping, or has something else taken his place?

**Complications:**
- The investigation must be deniable
- Whatever broke Aldric remains present
- The Light-field is weak or absent in the depths
- Some things beneath the Chapel have been waiting for visitors
