# Overview

| Attribute           | Value                                                                            |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Type**            | Political                                                                        |
| **Status**          | Fragile                                                                          |
| **Scope**           | Imperial (Nominal), Regional (Actual)                                            |
| **Primary Base**    | The Crown (Aurheim), Imperial Palace                                             |
| **Symbol/Heraldry** | The Imperial Sunburst behind a broken crown — unofficial, never formally adopted |

The Regency Council is the governing body of Aurheim, ruling in the name of Emperor Constantinus IV who disappeared on the third night of the Passing. Established as a temporary measure to maintain order until the Emperor's return, the Council has now persisted for seven years, its members better at preventing each other from seizing power than at actually governing.

The Council claims authority over the entire Empire but actually controls a twenty-mile radius around the capital with any consistency. Their writs are acknowledged where convenient, ignored where not. The system works only because everyone fears what would replace it.

# Part One: Leadership & Hierarchy

## Structure

The Regency Council is a committee of equals, at least in theory. No single member holds formal supremacy—this was by design, intended to prevent any one faction from dominating during the interregnum. In practice, decisions require majority or unanimous vote depending on their significance, and coalition-building consumes most of the Council's energy.

**Meeting Schedule:**
- Full Council sessions: Three times weekly in the Hall of Judgment
- Emergency sessions: Called by any two members
- Private consultations: Constantly, as members maneuver for advantage

**Decision Categories:**
| Category               | Requirement            | Examples                                 |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Routine Administration | Simple majority        | Tax disbursements, minor appointments    |
| Military Action        | Supermajority (4 of 5) | Troop deployments, defensive measures    |
| Emergency Powers       | Unanimous              | Succession declarations, capital defense |

## Current Leadership

| Position                 | Name                        | Portfolio                             |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Lord Regent              | Valerius Corbulo            | Presiding officer, external relations |
| Military Commander       | General Aurelia Corvinus    | 3rd Imperial Legion, defense          |
| High Chamberlain         | Petronius Silanus           | Palace administration, access control |
| Grandmaster of Exchequer | Cassian Veratrus            | Treasury, economic policy             |
| Sacred Representative    | Pontifex Lucerna Marcellina | Church liaison, religious legitimacy  |

## Power Dynamics

The Council is paralyzed by design. Each member holds enough power to block the others but not enough to act alone:

**Valerius Corbulo** has seniority and legitimacy but no direct force. He can't compel anyone to do anything.

**Aurelia Corvinus** has soldiers but needs Veratrus's money to pay them. A military coup would be short-lived without treasury access.

**Petronius Silanus** controls who enters the Palace—and therefore who accesses the others. His power is invisible but pervasive.

**Cassian Veratrus** has the gold but no swords. He can starve any initiative of funds, but can't actively pursue his own agenda without protection.

**Lucerna Marcellina** provides the veneer of divine sanction but answers (nominally) to Vandgwyn. Her loyalty is perpetually questioned.

**The Result:** Stalemate. The Council agrees only on preventing worse outcomes—maintaining the garrison, paying the guards, feeding just enough people to prevent riots. Anything more ambitious fails in committee.

# Part Two: Key Figures

## 1. Lord Regent Valerius Corbulo

| Attribute | Value                                              |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Title** | Lord Regent of the Empire, First Minister of State |
| **Role**  | Presiding officer, nominal head of government      |
| **Age**   | 68                                                 |

### Character

Valerius Corbulo is the senior surviving minister from the old government—the last man standing from an administration that no longer exists. He's old, frail, and increasingly tired, but he remains in his chair because he's terrified of what would happen if he left it.

Before the Passing, Corbulo was Minister of Provincial Relations—a diplomatic role requiring patience, compromise, and the ability to make everyone feel heard without committing to anything. These skills have proven unexpectedly valuable. He's spent seven years mediating between ambitious colleagues, preventing coups through sheer exhaustion, and maintaining the fiction of legitimate government through willpower alone.

He's fundamentally decent. This is both his strength and his weakness. He genuinely believes in the Empire, in the rule of law, in the idea that civilization matters. He refuses to take ruthless actions that might be necessary. He extends trust to people who don't deserve it. He believes, against all evidence, that the Emperor might return.

**Appearance:** Thin, white-haired, stooped with age. He dresses in formal robes that seem too large for him now—he's shrunk over the years. His hands shake when he's tired, which is always. His voice is soft but carries in the Council chamber; people lean in to listen.

**Mannerisms:**
- Refers to "the Emperor" in present tense, never past
- Quotes Imperial legal precedents constantly
- Takes detailed notes in personal cipher
- Apologizes before and after every hard decision

### Goal

To hold the Empire together until proper authority returns—whether that means the Emperor's unlikely return, the discovery of a legitimate heir, or the emergence of someone capable of legitimate succession. He sees himself as a caretaker, maintaining the structure for whoever comes next.

**Immediate objectives:**
- Prevent Council members from seizing power
- Maintain diplomatic relations with Vandgwyn (despite tensions)
- Keep the population fed enough to prevent revolt
- Locate and protect any surviving Imperial heirs

### Complication

Corbulo is dying. His physicians give him perhaps two years, possibly less. He tells no one, but the other Council members notice his increasing absences, his lapses in attention, the way he sometimes forgets names he's known for decades.

His death—or incapacity—would shatter the Council's fragile balance. He knows this. He's desperately trying to engineer a stable succession before it happens, but his attempts to favor any candidate immediately trigger opposition from the others. The harder he tries to solve the problem, the worse he makes it.

## 2. General Aurelia Corvinus

| Attribute | Value                                                        |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Title** | Commander of the 3rd Imperial Legion, Protector of the Crown |
| **Role**  | Military authority, external defense                         |
| **Age**   | 45                                                           |

### Character

Aurelia Corvinus is the most competent person on the Regency Council and the most frustrated by its dysfunction. A career military officer who rose through talent rather than birth, she commanded the 3rd Imperial Legion during the Passing and held her forces together when three other legions disintegrated.

She's direct, practical, and has no patience for the political games that consume her colleagues. Her solutions are always efficient: identify the problem, deploy resources, solve it, move on. She cannot understand why the others spend so much time arguing when the path forward is obvious.

The path forward is never obvious to politicians.

She despises the Regency Council's paralysis but won't seize power herself. Partly this is principle—she swore an oath to the Emperor, not to herself. Partly it's pragmatism—a military government would face immediate rebellion from every faction. Mostly it's uncertainty—she knows how to win battles, but governing seems like a different kind of war, one she's not trained for.

**Appearance:** Tall, broad-shouldered, weathered from field campaigns. Short gray-streaked hair, kept practical. She wears her Legion armor to Council meetings—in formal settings, this reads as either impressive or threatening, depending on your position.

**Mannerisms:**
- Speaks in short, declarative sentences
- Interrupts lengthy debates with "What's the objective?"
- Maintains rigid posture even when seated
- Checks exits unconsciously upon entering any room

### Goal

To restore order—real order, not the pretense of order. She wants the legions rebuilt, the roads secured, the Reft cleared, and the Empire functioning again. She doesn't particularly care who rules as long as they're competent.

**Immediate objectives:**
- Rebuild the 3rd Legion to full strength (currently at 40%)
- Secure the agricultural belt surrounding Aurheim
- Eliminate the three rival generals occupying the military headquarters
- Establish supply lines to loyal provincial garrisons

### Complication

Corvinus is haunted by what she did during the Passing. When the chaos was at its peak and supplies were failing, she ordered her legion to seize food shipments meant for refugee camps. Her soldiers ate while civilians starved. Hundreds died—she doesn't know the exact number.

She tells herself it was necessary. An unfed army becomes a mob. She saved her legion, and her legion saved the city. The math was brutal but correct.

She tells herself this frequently. She doesn't believe it anymore.

If her actions became public, the fragile legitimacy she provides the Council would evaporate. Someone knows—she's received anonymous notes referencing specific incidents. The blackmailer hasn't made demands yet, which is somehow worse than if they had.

## 3. Grandmaster Cassian Veratrus

| Attribute | Value                                                     |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Title** | Grandmaster of the Imperial Exchequer, Keeper of the Coin |
| **Role**  | Treasury control, economic policy                         |
| **Age**   | 52                                                        |

### Character

Cassian Veratrus is brilliant, arrogant, and convinced that only he can save the Empire—if only the fools around him would recognize his genius. He controls what remains of the Imperial treasury, which gives him leverage over everyone. Soldiers need to be paid. Walls need to be maintained. Food needs to be purchased. All of this requires his authorization.

Before the Passing, Veratrus was a rising star in the financial ministry—young for his position, innovative, ruthless in cutting waste. The catastrophe killed his superiors and elevated him to the top. He's adapted to power with disturbing ease.

He sees the Empire as a balance sheet. Resources in, services out, risks hedged, investments optimized. The collapse represents a problem of inefficient allocation: too many people consuming resources, too few producing them, too much chaos degrading infrastructure. His solutions are mathematical—and therefore, he believes, objective.

They are not objective. They consistently favor those who control resources (like himself) and disadvantage those who merely need them (like everyone else).

**Appearance:** Middle-aged, well-groomed, expensively dressed despite claiming austerity. Soft hands that have never held a weapon. A thin smile that reaches his mouth but never his eyes.

**Mannerisms:**
- Reduces every argument to numbers
- Maintains detailed ledgers of favors given and owed
- Never makes a decision without calculating the cost
- Refers to people as "resources" or "assets"

### Goal

Power—specifically, the kind of power that comes from being indispensable. He wants to become so central to the Empire's functioning that no government can exist without him. Not Emperor (too exposed), but the power behind whatever throne emerges.

**Immediate objectives:**
- Consolidate control over remaining Imperial assets
- Build a network of economic dependencies throughout the Heartland
- Undermine potential rivals' financial positions
- Position himself as kingmaker when succession is resolved

### Complication

The treasury isn't as full as Veratrus claims. He's been cooking the books for years, using creative accounting to hide how much was lost during the Passing. If the real numbers became public, confidence would collapse—and with it, his power.

He's increasingly desperate to find new revenue sources. This has led him to some unsavory arrangements: deals with bandits for protection money, secretly taxing refugees, even exploring contact with the Shiranui Consortium for loans that would compromise Imperial sovereignty. Each compromise makes the next one easier.

He's not a villain in his own mind. He's doing what's necessary. The alternatives are worse. These are the choices he's made, and he's too deep to unmake them.

# Part Three: Goals & Tensions

## Primary Goal

**Survival and Legitimacy Maintenance**

The Council's primary goal is simply to continue existing—maintaining the fiction of legitimate Imperial government long enough for something better to emerge. This is surprisingly difficult. Every day brings challenges: food shortages, factional disputes, Reft incursions, demands from Vandgwyn, pressure from lesser lords wanting independence.

## Secondary Goals

- **Locate Imperial Heirs:** Any surviving member of the Imperial family would resolve the succession crisis — or complicate it immeasurably
- **Secure Food Supply:** The agricultural belt around Aurheim must be protected or the city starves within weeks
- **Reconcile with Vandgwyn:** Church-state conflict threatens to split the Empire permanently
- **Rebuild Military Capacity:** The legions must be restored to project power beyond the capital

## Internal Tensions

### The Succession Question
No one agrees on what happens when legitimate authority is restored—or whether it ever will be. Corbulo wants to find an heir. Corvinus wants a functioning government regardless of bloodline. Veratrus wants to be indispensable to whoever wins. Silanus wants to survive the transition. Marcellina wants the Church to sanction the outcome.

### The Vandgwyn Split
Pontifex Marcellina is supposed to represent Church interests in the Council. But who does she actually serve? The Council suspects she reports to Cardinal Theron. Cardinal Draconis suspects she's gone native. She suspects everyone is right, which means everyone is wrong.

### Resource Allocation
Every decision advantages some faction and disadvantages others. Military spending strengthens Corvinus. Financial caution benefits Veratrus. Religious expenditure empowers Marcellina. The result is that almost nothing gets done—any initiative requires log-rolling that consumes resources in transaction costs.

## External Tensions

### Vandgwyn's Claims
The Church hierarchy increasingly asserts temporal authority, arguing that legitimate government requires religious sanction. The Council rejects this—but they need the Church's moral legitimacy and can't afford open conflict.

### Provincial Independence
Beyond the twenty-mile radius the Council actually controls, regional powers are declaring effective independence. They still acknowledge Imperial authority in theory, but ignore it in practice. Each passing year makes reunification less likely.

### The Bridge
Commander Marcella's neutral control of Castellum Pontem infuriates both capitals. The Council wants the crossing under their authority. So does Vandgwyn. Marcella has made clear that any attack results in the bridge's destruction.

# Part Four: Assets & Resources

## Material Resources

| Resource               | Status              | Notes                                                |
| ---------------------- | ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Treasury**           | Depleted (secretly) | Veratrus claims solvency; reality is worse           |
| **Imperial Palace**    | Controlled          | Massive infrastructure; maintenance costs escalating |
| **Tax Revenue**        | Limited             | Only collected from territory actually controlled    |
| **Imperial Granaries** | Low                 | Three months' supply at current consumption          |
| **Royal Estates**      | Uncertain           | Many claimed but not actually held                   |

## Institutional Power

**The Imperial Bureaucracy:** Skeletal but functional. Ministry buildings still operate, clerks still process paperwork, records are still maintained. The bureaucracy provides continuity—people know how to request permits, file appeals, register marriages. This matters more than it seems.

**The Legal System:** Imperial courts still convene. Their judgments are enforced inconsistently, but the idea of Imperial law persists. This is the Council's deepest source of legitimacy—they represent the legal order, however damaged.

**The Diplomatic Network:** What remains of the embassy system recognizes the Council as the Empire's voice. This is more symbolic than practical, but symbols matter.

## Military/Enforcement Capability

| Force                   | Size         | Notes                                      |
| ----------------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| 3rd Imperial Legion     | ~4,000       | Core force; loyal to Corvinus              |
| Palace Guard            | ~800         | Ceremonial but armed; loyal to institution |
| City Watch              | ~1,200       | Police force; variable quality             |
| Racing Faction Militias | ~3,000 total | Unreliable; follow their sponsors          |
| Guild Guards            | ~2,000 total | Protect guild interests only               |

**Total reliable force:** ~5,000 soldiers and guardsmen
**Total potential force:** ~10,000 if factions cooperate (they won't)

## Knowledge & Secrets

**The Imperial Archives:** Complete records of every law, treaty, and official correspondence. Whoever controls the narrative of what the Empire was controls what it might become.

**The Cellar Mystery:** The Council knows more about what lies beneath the Palace than they admit. Search parties have returned with maps showing passages that shouldn't exist. Something is down there. The Council has forbidden further exploration—but knowledge of the cellars' true extent is valuable.

**Spy Networks:** Each Council member maintains intelligence operations. Corvinus has military scouts. Veratrus has financial informants. Silanus has Palace servants. Marcellina has confessional whispers. They spy on each other as much as on external threats.

# Part Five: Relationships

| Faction                  | Relationship       | Notes                                                         |
| ------------------------ | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Church Hierarchy**     | Tense Alliance     | Mutual dependence, mutual resentment; marriage of convenience |
| **The Bridge**           | Hostile Neutrality | Council wants control but can't seize it                      |
| **Council of Captains**  | Distant Relations  | Golden Coast acknowledges nominal Imperial authority          |
| **The Scouring**         | Officially Opposed | Inquisition activities complicate relations                   |
| **Trading Houses**       | Transactional      | Pay taxes, receive protection (theoretically)                 |
| **Provincial Lords**     | Nominal Vassals    | Accept Imperial authority in theory, ignore it in practice    |
| **Vandgwyn Cardinalate** | Complex Rivalry    | Spiritual capital vs. secular capital                         |

---

# Part Six: Adventure Hooks

## 1. The Heir in the Camps

**Situation:** In the refugee camps of Radius Domorum, a boy of about twelve has attracted attention. He looks remarkably like portraits of the late Crown Prince Lucius at that age. He appeared after the Passing with no memory of his past. He's been sheltered by camp-dwellers who've noticed the resemblance—and noticed others noticing.

**The Question:** Is this boy genuinely an Imperial heir, a false pretender, or something stranger? And who should make that determination?

**Complications:**
- Multiple Council factions want to control any potential heir
- The Church hierarchy might accept or reject the claim
- The boy himself has no memory and no agenda—he's genuinely confused
- Someone is killing people who've spent time with him, as if eliminating witnesses

## 2. The Cellar Expedition

**Situation:** General Corvinus has authorized a secret mission into the Palace cellars—directly violating Council prohibition. The last exploration team found their missing Emperor's crown, but no body. She wants to know what happened to Constantinus IV and whether he—or something wearing his face—is still down there.

**The Question:** What actually happened during the Passing beneath the Imperial Palace? Can the Emperor be rescued, or is he beyond rescuing?

**Complications:**
- The mission must remain secret from other Council members
- The cellars extend impossibly deep, defying architecture
- Something down there has been leaving messages—carved in Imperial script, but making no sense
- The giant beneath the city may not be fully sleeping anymore

## 3. The Assassination Market

**Situation:** Grandmaster Veratrus has received credible intelligence that someone is taking bids for his assassination. Not a simple murder—a formal contract, open to qualified bidders, with payment held in escrow pending completion.

**The Question:** Who wants Veratrus dead badly enough to fund a professional hit? And can the plot be stopped—or turned to someone's advantage?

**Complications:**
- Multiple parties have motive; Veratrus has made many enemies
- The contract holder is unknown—discovering their identity is half the problem
- Veratrus's own paranoia makes investigation difficult
- The investigators might decide the contract should be fulfilled

## 4. The Vandgwyn Envoy

**Situation:** Cardinal Seraphina Valens is sending a personal envoy to Aurheim—ostensibly to discuss reconciliation, actually to assess whether the Regency Council can be allied with the Reformist faction before the Orthodox faction moves against both.

**The Question:** What does Seraphina actually want? Can the Council trust her offer? And what will Cardinal Draconis do when he learns of the secret negotiations?

**Complications:**
- Pontifex Marcellina doesn't know about the envoy—if discovered, her position becomes impossible
- The Orthodox faction has spies in Aurheim
- Seraphina's offer might be genuine—or a trap to expose Reformist sympathizers
- Alliance with Vandgwyn reformers would infuriate Imperial traditionalists
