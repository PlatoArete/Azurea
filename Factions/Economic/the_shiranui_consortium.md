| **Symbol/Heraldry** | A red phoenix rising from blue waves — the sunset-over-sea that gives Shiranui its name |

The Shiranui Consortium is the trading organization of the Shiranui Archipelago, an island nation far to the east where fire and sea meet. For centuries, they've been the Empire's primary connection to eastern goods—silk, spices, lacquerware, philosophies, and technologies unknown in the west. Their compound in Portus Aureus is a sealed enclave: foreign territory on Imperial soil.

The Passing has transformed the Consortium from trading partners to potential conquerors. Imperial weakness presents opportunity. The Consortium's leadership sees a chance to move from commerce to dominance—controlling not just eastern trade but the Empire's economic infrastructure entirely. They are patient, well-resourced, and playing a longer game than anyone in the west understands.

# Part One: Leadership & Hierarchy

## Structure

The Consortium is not a single entity but a federation of Shiranui trading clans, coordinated through a central governing council called the Merchant Assembly. Each major clan has its own operations, assets, and agenda—but they present a unified face to foreigners.

**Shiranui Internal Structure:**

```
The Merchant Assembly (Seven great families)
    ↓
Chief Factor (Appointed to lead foreign operations)
    ↓
Senior Factors (Clan representatives abroad)
    ↓
Factors (Managing specific operations)
    ↓
Agents (Transaction-level work)
    ↓
Servants and Labor (Local hires, indentured workers)
```

**The Imperial Operation:**
All Consortium presence in Imperial territory reports to the Chief Factor, currently Mei Ling-Feng. She has broad authority but ultimately answers to the Assembly back home.

## Current Leadership

| Position         | Name                 | Notes                                    |
| ---------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Chief Factor     | Mei Ling-Feng        | Thirty years in-country; split loyalties |
| Deputy Factor    | Takeshi Kuroda       | Newly arrived; Assembly's watchdog       |
| Trade Master     | Chen Wei-Lin         | Controls cargo operations                |
| Security Chief   | Yamamoto Kenji       | Compound defense and intelligence        |
| Cultural Attaché | Lady Sakura Murakami | Manages social appearances               |

## Power Dynamics

**Mei Ling-Feng's Position:**
Mei has authority, but her long residence in the Empire makes the Assembly suspicious. They've sent Takeshi Kuroda ostensibly as assistant but actually as inspector. The power dynamic is tense: Mei has institutional knowledge; Kuroda has Assembly backing.

**Clan Competition:**
The seven great families have different interests:
- **Feng Clan:** Traditional traders, favor partnership
- **Kuroda Clan:** Expansionists, favor dominance
- **Chen Clan:** Maritime, focused on shipping routes
- **Yamamoto Clan:** Security, intelligence, and protection services
- **Murakami Clan:** Cultural influence, "soft power"
- **Tanaka Clan:** Manufacturing, want new markets
- **Ito Clan:** Banking, financing, currency manipulation

The Assembly's policy reflects the current balance among these interests. That balance has shifted toward the expansionist Kuroda clan since the Passing.

# Part Two: Key Figures

## 1. Chief Factor Mei Ling-Feng

*See The Council of Captains faction document for detailed profile*

**Summary:** Thirty-year veteran of Imperial posting. Speaks Imperial Latin flawlessly. Caught between cultures and increasingly at odds with her orders from home. The Consortium's growing aggression threatens everything she's built.

---

## 2. Deputy Factor Takeshi Kuroda

| Attribute | Value                                         |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Title** | Deputy Factor for Imperial Operations         |
| **Role**  | Assembly watchdog, Mei's eventual replacement |
| **Age**   | 34                                            |

### Character

Takeshi Kuroda arrived in Portus Aureus six months ago with clear instructions: evaluate the Consortium's Imperial operations, assess Mei Ling-Feng's loyalty, and prepare to assume command when the Assembly decides she's finished.

He's young, ambitious, and everything Mei is not. Where she's patient, he's aggressive. Where she values relationships, he sees only leverage. His clan—the Kuroda—lead the expansionist faction in the Assembly. They've placed him here to ensure their policies are implemented regardless of Mei's preferences.

He doesn't understand the Empire. He's studied it academically—language, customs, politics—but thirty years of reports can't match thirty years of presence. He makes mistakes that Mei would never make: too direct in negotiation, too visible in intelligence operations, too willing to offend people whose resentment might matter later.

He's also not wrong about the opportunity. The Empire is weak. The Consortium is strong. Someone is going to fill the power vacuum. Why not Shiranui?

**Appearance:** Young, handsome, impeccably dressed in eastern fashion. His clothes and bearing scream "foreign" in ways that Mei's hybrid style doesn't. He wants to be noticed.

**Mannerisms:**
- Speaks excellent Imperial Latin with deliberate accent (emphasizing foreignness)
- Takes detailed notes on everything (reports to the Assembly)
- Pushes for faster action on every decision
- Dismisses local customs as "charming but irrelevant"

### Goal

To implement the Assembly's expansion policy and return home as the architect of Shiranui dominance in the west. He sees this posting as a stepping stone to power within his clan.

**Immediate objectives:**
- Document Mei's "failures" to hasten her replacement
- Accelerate economic manipulation strategies
- Establish intelligence networks beyond what Mei built
- Create dependency relationships with key Imperial figures

### Complication

Kuroda is being manipulated by his own agents. Security Chief Yamamoto has his own agenda—he's been providing selected intelligence to Imperial authorities, playing both sides to protect Consortium interests against both Kuroda's rashness and the Empire's resentment.

Kuroda doesn't know that his "secret" initiatives are being monitored by his own security chief. If he realizes, he might react violently. The situation is a powder keg that could explode in multiple directions.

## 3. Security Chief Yamamoto Kenji

| Attribute | Value                                            |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Title** | Chief of Compound Security                       |
| **Role**  | Protection, intelligence, and quiet manipulation |
| **Age**   | 50                                               |

### Character

Yamamoto Kenji has served the Consortium for thirty years, protecting its interests in places where violence was common and ethics were negotiable. He's killed people—many people—in service of Shiranui commerce. He's also prevented far more deaths by anticipating problems before they required lethal solutions.

He thinks in terms of systems rather than individuals. The Consortium is a system that benefits his homeland. The Empire is a system that might threaten or partner with his masters. His job is ensuring the systems interact productively—or that one absorbs the other with minimal disruption.

He supports neither Mei nor Kuroda entirely. Mei is too accommodating; she'd sacrifice Consortium interests to preserve relationships. Kuroda is too aggressive; he'd provoke responses that would cost lives and resources. Yamamoto walks between them, providing information to each that moderates their extremes.

He's also maintaining secret contact with Imperial intelligence—specifically, elements within the Regency Council who want to know what the Consortium is planning. He's not betraying Shiranui; he's ensuring that if things go wrong, there's a negotiation channel already established.

**Appearance:** Unremarkable by design. Medium height, medium build, forgettable face. His eyes are the only distinctive feature—the flat assessment of someone who's calculated how to kill everyone in the room.

**Mannerisms:**
- Speaks minimally
- Appears from unexpected angles
- Never sits with back to door
- Addresses everyone with precisely appropriate respect (never more, never less)

### Goal

To ensure the Consortium's long-term success, even if that means restraining short-term ambitions.

**Immediate objectives:**
- Prevent Kuroda from provoking catastrophic response
- Maintain back-channel communications with multiple parties
- Protect Mei from replacement until a suitable successor emerges
- Prepare contingencies for various conflict scenarios

### Complication

Yamamoto has a son among the compound workers—the result of a brief relationship years ago. The mother died; Yamamoto has never acknowledged the boy publicly. The son doesn't know his father's identity.

If this becomes known, Yamamoto's objectivity will be questioned. More urgently, the boy—now a young man—has begun involving himself in local politics, specifically the reformist network Cardinal Valens is building. He's putting himself in danger, and Yamamoto faces an impossible choice between protecting his son and maintaining his cover.

# Part Three: Goals & Tensions

## Primary Goal

**Economic Dominance**

The Consortium's current instructions are to transition from trading partner to controlling interest. This means: extending credit that can't be repaid, acquiring strategic assets, and creating dependencies that transform commercial relationships into de facto colonial control.

## Secondary Goals

- **Intelligence Gathering:** Understand Imperial power structures well enough to manipulate them
- **Cultural Influence:** Normalize Shiranui presence; reduce resistance to eastern involvement
- **Strategic Positioning:** Ensure that when the Empire stabilizes (or collapses entirely), Shiranui is positioned to benefit
- **Home Communication:** Keep the Assembly informed and satisfied with progress

## Internal Tensions

### Mei vs. Kuroda
Fundamental disagreement over methods: partnership vs. exploitation. One will eventually eliminate the other.

### Clan Interests
The seven families have different priorities. Trade routes matter more to some; manufacturing access to others. These competing interests create friction in Consortium policy.

### Pace of Action
Some elements want to accelerate plans while the Empire is weak. Others counsel patience, waiting for clearer outcomes. The tension is unresolved.

## External Tensions

### Local Resentment
Imperial merchants resent Consortium competition. Nationalists resent foreign influence. The Church suspects eastern religious contamination. Many parties would celebrate Consortium failure.

### Counter-Intelligence
The Regency Council, the Church, and individual trading houses all run intelligence operations against the Consortium. The compound is watched constantly.

### Cultural Gaps
Despite thirty years of presence, Shiranui culture remains alien to most Imperials. Misunderstandings are constant, and some deliberately manufactured by enemies.

# Part Four: Assets & Resources

## Material Resources

| Resource               | Status                     | Notes                           |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Trading Vessels**    | 8 ships in Imperial waters | More available from homeland    |
| **The Compound**       | Fortified enclave          | Sovereign territory; defensible |
| **Trade Goods**        | Extensive inventory        | Silk, spices, lacquer, ceramics |
| **Currency Reserves**  | Substantial                | Both eastern and Imperial       |
| **Information Assets** | Extensive network          | Intelligence on many parties    |

## Institutional Power

**Exclusive Trade Rights:** Certain eastern goods (specific spices, manufacturing techniques) are available only through the Consortium. This creates dependence.

**Credit Extension:** The Consortium has become a significant lender to Imperial merchants. Debts create leverage.

**Foreign Consul Status:** Under treaty, the Consortium has diplomatic protections that limit Imperial authority over their citizens.

## Intelligence Capability

| Network                 | Focus                                   | Size                 |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Commercial Intelligence | Market information, competitor analysis | 50+ agents           |
| Political Intelligence  | Government and Church developments      | 20+ agents           |
| Counter-Intelligence    | Protecting Consortium secrets           | Yamamoto's specialty |
| Cultural Observation    | Social trends, alliance opportunities   | Lady Sakura's domain |

# Part Five: Relationships

| Faction                  | Relationship     | Notes                                                |
| ------------------------ | ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **House Caelum**         | Primary Partners | Mei and Aurelia work together closely                |
| **Other Trading Houses** | Competitive      | Seen as threat to local commerce                     |
| **Council of Captains**  | Complex          | Officially allies; privately suspicious              |
| **Regency Council**      | Wary             | Each watching the other                              |
| **Church Hierarchy**     | Suspicious       | Eastern beliefs considered heretical                 |
| **Admiral Severinus**    | Neutral          | Respects their seamanship                            |
| **Ti-Abzu**              | Unknown          | Eastern peoples may have different undersea contacts |

# Part Six: Adventure Hooks

## 1. The Inspector's Moves

**Situation:** Takeshi Kuroda is preparing a report recommending Mei Ling-Feng's removal and implementing aggressive expansion policies. His activities are provoking exactly the backlash Mei has spent thirty years preventing. Someone needs to either moderate Kuroda, discredit him to the Assembly, or prepare for the consequences of his success.

**The Question:** Can Kuroda be stopped? Should he be? And what happens to the Consortium's relationship with the Empire if he succeeds—or fails?

**Complications:**
- Kuroda has Assembly backing; opposing him means opposing Shiranui policy
- Mei's allies include people who might not want foreign involvement at all
- Yamamoto is playing his own game that might help or harm either side
- Direct action against Kuroda could be interpreted as attack on Shiranui itself
- Some of Kuroda's analysis might be correct even if his methods are wrong

## 2. The Compound Defector

**Situation:** A Consortium agent wants to defect—they have information about specific expansion operations and intelligence networks. They're offering this to the Regency Council in exchange for protection. The Consortium has discovered the approach and is preparing to "handle" the problem.

**The Question:** Should the defector be protected? Can they actually provide useful intelligence? And what price is worth paying for information that might expose Consortium plans?

**Complications:**
- The defector might be a Consortium plant, providing disinformation
- Protecting them means open conflict with the Consortium
- The intelligence might reveal Imperial collaborators who won't want exposure
- Yamamoto already knows about the defector and may be testing responses
- The information might be real but not worth the consequences of acting on it

## 3. The Eastern Bride

**Situation:** Lucia Caela, Aurelia's daughter, is expected to marry into Shiranui nobility and relocate permanently east. This marriage would bind House Caelum to Consortium interests for generations. But Lucia has received disturbing letters from an anonymous source describing what happens to eastern-married women who try to leave. She's frightened and wants investigation before commitment.

**The Question:** Is the information real? Is someone trying to sabotage the marriage? And what would it mean for Imperial-Shiranui relations if a great house pulls back from the alliance?

**Complications:**
- The anonymous source might be a Consortium enemy trying to disrupt relations
- The information might be true—Shiranui has different gender expectations
- Aurelia needs this marriage for political and commercial reasons
- Lucia's own feelings about the marriage are complex
- Other parties (House Varro, the Church) would benefit from the marriage failing

## 4. The Third Party

**Situation:** Someone is systematically sabotaging both Consortium and Imperial shipping—destroying cargo, sinking vessels, killing crews. The attacks are too sophisticated for pirates, too well-informed for random action. A third party is operating in the waters between powers.

**The Question:** Who is behind the attacks? What do they want? And can the Consortium and Imperial merchants cooperate long enough to find out?

**Complications:**
- Each side suspects the other of staging attacks to create pretexts
- The attacks might come from undersea peoples, foreign powers, or internal dissidents
- Cooperation between longtime rivals is fragile and easily exploited
- The third party might be testing responses before larger action
- Solving this together might create precedents the Consortium would rather avoid
