# Overview

| Attribute           | Value                                 |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Type**            | Economic/Political                    |
| **Status**          | Active                                |
| **Scope**           | Empire-wide (Urban)                   |
| **Primary Base**    | Major cities; guild halls in each     |
| **Symbol/Heraldry** | Varies by guild; crossed tools common |

The Guilds are the professional organizations that have structured urban labor for centuries—associations of craftspeople, merchants, and specialists who regulate their trades, train apprentices, maintain standards, and defend members' interests. They're not technically political factions, but their economic power translates inevitably into political influence.

In theory, guilds serve the public by ensuring quality and training skilled workers. In practice, they're self-interested organizations that restrict competition, raise prices, and protect members at public expense. Both descriptions are true; guilds are complex institutions that do both good and harm.

Since the Passing disrupted everything, the guilds have become more important than ever. When governments fail and supply chains break, the people who can actually make and repair things become essential. Skilled labor is power; the guilds have that labor organized.

# Part One: The Guild System

## Major Guilds

The Empire has dozens of guilds, but several dominate:

| Guild                   | Focus                            | Influence                             |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Smiths' Guild**       | Metalwork, weapons, tools        | Very high (essential production)      |
| **Builders' Guild**     | Construction, masonry, carpentry | High (infrastructure)                 |
| **Merchants' Guild**    | Trade, transport, finance        | Very high (economic coordination)     |
| **Weavers' Guild**      | Textile production, clothing     | Moderate (essential but common)       |
| **Victuallers' Guild**  | Food supply, brewing, baking     | High (everyone eats)                  |
| **Apothecaries' Guild** | Medicine, healing, herbalism     | Growing (post-Passing medicine needs) |
| **Shipwrights' Guild**  | Ship construction, port services | High (coastal trade)                  |

## Guild Structure

Each guild follows similar organizational patterns:

```
Guild Master (Elected head)
    ↓
Council of Wardens (Senior masters; policy-making)
    ↓
Masters (Full members; vote on guild matters)
    ↓
Journeymen (Trained practitioners; seeking mastership)
    ↓
Apprentices (In training; bound to masters)
```

**Guild Halls:**
Each guild maintains a hall in major cities—meeting space, training facilities, storage, and political headquarters. The halls are often the most stable institutions in their cities.

# Part Two: Key Figures

### Artificer-General Magnus Ironhand (Smiths' Guild)

| Attribute | Value                                           |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Title** | Artificer-General of the Imperial Smiths' Guild |
| **Role**  | Head of most powerful guild                     |
| **Age**   | 55                                              |

**Character:** Magnus has led the Smiths' Guild for twelve years—turning it from one guild among many into the most influential non-governmental organization in the Empire. His secret is simple: make everyone depend on you, then exploit that dependence carefully.

Every weapon the Regency's forces carry was made by guild smiths. Every tool that farmers use was guild-produced. The infrastructure everyone depends on exists because smiths maintain it. Magnus has leveraged this position ruthlessly while maintaining reputation for fair dealing.

He's genuinely skilled—a master smith whose work is sought by collectors—and he expects similar quality from all guild members. His standards enforcement is legendary: produce substandard goods, and Magnus will break your hands himself. This too is good politics: quality reputation justifies the guild's privileges.

**Goal:** To maintain and expand smith-guild influence while ensuring members prosper.

**Complication:** Magnus has been approached by the Regency Council about "closer cooperation"—essentially, subordinating the guild to government direction. He's resistant, but the pressure is increasing. Independence versus security is becoming a forced choice.

### Chancellor Prudentia Goldfinch (Merchants' Guild)

| Attribute | Value                                            |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Title** | Chancellor of the United Merchants' Guilds       |
| **Role**  | Coordinates merchant interests across the Empire |
| **Age**   | 62                                               |

**Character:** Prudentia speaks for the Merchants' Guild in Imperial councils—coordinating the interests of traders from various cities and trades into a unified political voice. She's arguably the most politically sophisticated guild leader, spending more time in negotiation than commerce.

She's watched the post-Passing chaos from a merchant's perspective: trade routes break, supply chains fail, prices spike, opportunists profit while honest traders struggle. Her response has been to push for guild authority over commercial matters—essentially, making the Merchants' Guild the regulator of trade when government regulation has failed.

She works closely (and carefully) with the major Trading Houses but maintains distance: the Houses are competitors as well as partners. Her guild serves medium-scale merchants who might otherwise be crushed between giant competitors.

**Goal:** To establish merchant-guild authority over commercial regulation, creating order from post-Passing chaos.

**Complication:** Prudentia's regulatory ambitions put her in conflict with the Trading Houses, who prefer less oversight. Her balancing act between representing guild interests and maintaining House relationships is becoming unsustainable.

### Master Physician Cornelius Salve (Apothecaries' Guild)

| Attribute | Value                                         |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Title** | Master Physician of the Imperial Apothecaries |
| **Role**  | Head of healing-focused guild                 |
| **Age**   | 49                                            |

**Character:** Cornelius leads a guild that has become dramatically more important since the Passing. When Light-field healing weakened, secular medicine became essential. When populations displaced and hygiene collapsed, plague followed. When Reft attacks produced wounds that didn't heal normally, the Apothecaries were the ones who learned how to treat them.

He's pushed his guild from margin to center—expanding training, standardizing treatments, and positioning Apothecaries as essential response to post-Passing medical crises. His members are now welcome where they were once barely tolerated.

He's pragmatic about methods. If folk remedies work, learn them. If the Church's healing prayers still function sometimes, cooperate with clerics. If Ostaran death-workers know something about Reft-wounds, find out what. Results matter more than orthodoxy.

**Goal:** To build the Apothecaries' Guild into the Empire's primary healing institution.

**Complication:** Cornelius has discovered that some Reft-wounds can only be treated with methods the Church considers heretical—specifically, techniques from Ostaran and even Revnan traditions. He's using them secretly; discovery would destroy him.

# Part Three: Goals & Tensions

## Primary Goal

**Protect Member Interests**

Guilds exist to serve their members: securing favorable conditions, defending against competition, ensuring prosperity. Everything else—quality standards, public benefit, political activity—serves this purpose.

## Secondary Goals

- **Maintain Monopolies:** Ensure only guild members can practice each trade
- **Control Training:** Regulate who enters the profession and how
- **Influence Policy:** Shape laws and regulations in guild-favorable ways
- **Manage Post-Passing Transitions:** Adapt to changed circumstances while maintaining position

## Internal Tensions

### Inter-Guild Competition
Different guilds have different interests. Smiths and Builders compete for the same workers; Merchants and Victuallers disagree on food pricing regulation. Coordination is difficult.

### Master vs. Journeyman
Journeymen want opportunities for advancement; masters want to restrict competition. This generational tension is constant.

### Quality vs. Quantity
Maintaining standards is expensive and limits production. Market pressure pushes toward quantity; guild tradition pulls toward quality.

## External Tensions

### Government Authority
The Regency wants guild cooperation—or guild subordination. The relationship is negotiated constantly.

### Trading House Competition
The major Houses operate outside guild structures; guilds want to restrict them; Houses want to weaken guild power.

### Post-Passing Disruption
Everything has changed; guilds must adapt while maintaining the structures that give them power.

# Part Four: Adventure Hooks

## 1. The Regulation War

**Situation:** Chancellor Prudentia is pushing for merchant-guild regulatory authority over trade. The Trading Houses are resisting. Both sides are mobilizing supporters, applying pressure, and considering less savory tactics. Someone's going to get caught in the middle.

**The Question:** Should trade be guild-regulated or House-dominated? What happens when economic giants fight? And who benefits from the chaos while they're distracted?

**Complications:**
- Both sides have legitimate arguments
- Each side is willing to use questionable methods
- The outcome affects everyone who buys or sells anything
- Small merchants get crushed regardless of who wins
- External powers may exploit the conflict

## 2. The Heretical Cure

**Situation:** Master Cornelius has been saving lives with methods the Church would condemn. Someone's discovered his secret and is threatening exposure unless he provides services—services that would compromise the guild and potentially harm patients.

**The Question:** Should Cornelius yield to blackmail? Can the secret be protected another way? And what happens to the people his methods have saved if the treatments are exposed?

**Complications:**
- Exposure means death for Cornelius and possibly others
- The blackmailer's demands are escalating
- Some colleagues know fragments of the truth
- Church investigation would doom many people
- The treatments actually work—abandoning them costs lives
