| **Symbol/Heraldry** | Each house has distinct colors and symbols; collectively they're represented by golden scales |

The Major Trading Houses are the great merchant families who controlled inter-regional and international commerce before the Passing. When the catastrophe struck, many houses collapsed—their principals dead, their ships lost, their trade routes severed. The survivors have consolidated, absorbing the assets of the fallen and emerging with power rivaling provincial governments.

These are not guilds or corporations in the modern sense. They're dynasties: family networks spanning generations, bound by blood, marriage, and debt. Their wealth is practical—ships, warehouses, trade goods—and their power flows from controlling what everyone needs and no one else can provide.

# Part One: Leadership & Hierarchy

## The Great Houses

Five houses survived the Passing with sufficient assets to claim "Great" status. Others exist—minor houses, aspiring houses, houses reduced from former greatness—but these five control the trade that matters.

| House        | Specialty                          | Head              | Symbol                  |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------------- |
| **Caelum**   | Eastern trade, luxury goods        | Aurelia Caela     | Golden sun on blue      |
| **Petronia** | Shipbuilding, maritime services    | Marcus Petronius  | Silver anchor on black  |
| **Varro**    | Salt trade, preservation           | Helena Varro      | White diamond on red    |
| **Marina**   | Fishing fleets, coastal transport  | Quintus Marinus   | Green wave on white     |
| **Fortuna**  | Glass production, specialty crafts | Lucius Fortunatus | Crystal flame on purple |

## Structure Within Houses

Each great house follows similar organization:

```
Paterfamilias/Materfamilias (House Head)
    ↓
Family Council (Senior family members)
    ↓
Branch Heads (Extended family managing specific operations)
    ↓
Factors (Senior employees, often bound by marriage or debt)
    ↓
Clerks and Captains (Operational management)
    ↓
Workers (Sailors, warehouse staff, craftspeople)
```

## Power Dynamics

The houses compete fiercely but maintain conventions that prevent total war:
- **Exchange Agreements:** Disputes are resolved through the Weighing House, not violence
- **Marriage Networks:** Inter-house marriages create cross-cutting loyalties
- **Shared Infrastructure:** All houses use the same port, banking, and insurance systems
- **Common Threats:** External enemies unite the houses against outsiders

The balance is fragile. Every house seeks advantage. The conventions persist because their collapse would harm everyone—but someone might decide they can win the resulting chaos.

# Part Two: Key Figures

## 1. First Captain Aurelia Caela (House Caelum)

*See The Council of Captains faction document for detailed profile*

**Summary:** Head of the largest trading house, de facto leader of the Council. Controls eastern trade through the Shiranui relationship. Calculating, competent, facing personal crisis over her daughter's proposed eastern marriage.

---

## 2. Marcus Petronius (House Petronia)

| Attribute | Value                                       |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Title** | Patriarch of House Petronia, Second Captain |
| **Role**  | Shipbuilding monopoly, fleet maintenance    |
| **Age**   | 61                                          |

### Character

Marcus Petronius was born on a ship and will probably die on one. Three generations of his family built the shipyards of Portus Aureus, and he's spent sixty years ensuring that anyone who wants to sail these waters does so in Petronia-built vessels.

He's not a merchant—he's a craftsman who happens to control an industrial empire. He still inspects every major hull his yards produce, still argues with master builders about keelson placement, still knows the names of the carpenters who've worked for his family for decades. This hands-on approach makes him beloved by workers and frustrating to family members who want to modernize.

The Passing hurt House Petronia less than others—ships were lost, but the shipyards survived, and suddenly everyone needed replacements. Petronius has spent seven years building at capacity. His order book extends two years forward. He could raise prices dramatically; instead, he's kept them stable, earning loyalty that will matter when the current crisis stabilizes.

**Appearance:** Weathered, calloused hands, salt-and-pepper hair kept short. Dresses practically even in formal settings—you can take the man out of the shipyard, but not the shipyard out of the man.

**Mannerisms:**
- Evaluates everyone as potential employees
- Speaks slowly, considering each word
- Draws ship diagrams during meetings
- Judges people by how they treat workers

### Goal

To preserve House Petronia's position and ensure the next generation can continue the family's work. He's less interested in profit maximization than in sustainability.

**Immediate objectives:**
- Complete current shipbuilding contracts
- Train successors (his own children disappoint him; he's looking at nephews)
- Maintain workforce quality despite labor shortages
- Resist pressure to cut corners for speed

### Complication

His eldest son, Gaius, has been selling inferior materials as premium grade, pocketing the difference. Several ships built with these materials have structural weaknesses that will manifest under stress. Marcus doesn't know yet—but customers are starting to report problems.

When he discovers the fraud, Marcus will face an impossible choice: expose his son (destroying the boy's future and damaging house reputation) or cover it up (risking ships and lives). Either choice may break him.

## 3. Helena Varro (House Varro)

| Attribute | Value                                   |
| --------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Title** | Matriarch of House Varro, Third Captain |
| **Role**  | Salt monopoly, food preservation        |
| **Age**   | 48                                      |

### Character

Helena Varro controls salt—and since the Passing, salt means survival. Without refrigeration, without reliable transport, without the logistical systems that once moved fresh food across the Empire, salt preservation is the difference between fed populations and starving ones.

She's leveraged this ruthlessly. House Varro was mid-tier before the Passing. Now it's one of the great houses. Helena achieved this through strategic acquisitions, aggressive pricing, and a complete willingness to let competitors fail when she could save them.

She's not cruel—she's practical. The salt trade doesn't allow sentiment. Someone had to consolidate the industry after the Passing destroyed half the producers. She was willing to do what was necessary. The other houses hate her for rising so fast; she doesn't care. Results speak.

**Appearance:** Sharp-featured, always impeccably dressed in white (the Varro color), with cold gray eyes that calculate value instinctively. She moves with precision; nothing wasted.

**Mannerisms:**
- Speaks in short, declarative sentences
- Never negotiates when she can dictate
- Remembers every slight (and every favor)
- Treats business as warfare requiring no mercy

### Goal

To establish House Varro as first among the great houses. She wants her children to inherit dominance, not merely prosperity.

**Immediate objectives:**
- Acquire remaining independent salt producers
- Extend influence into food distribution networks
- Undermine House Caelum's coalition leadership
- Prepare for transition when Aurelia Caela inevitably stumbles

### Complication

Helena's youngest daughter, Livia, has joined the reformist movement within the Church. She's become an advocate for the poor—specifically, the poor who can't afford Varro salt prices. Livia has been publicly criticizing "monopolistic exploitation" without naming her family directly. Everyone knows anyway.

Helena could disown Livia. She could have her silenced through various means. She could also acknowledge that her daughter might be right about some things. Each option carries costs she's still calculating.

## 4. Quintus Marinus (House Marina)

| Attribute | Value                                     |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Title** | Patriarch of House Marina, Fourth Captain |
| **Role**  | Fishing fleets, coastal transport         |
| **Age**   | 55                                        |

### Character

Quintus Marinus runs the fishing fleets that feed the Golden Coast—and increasingly, the fleets that transport anything small enough to move by small boat along the coastline. When road transport became dangerous, coastal shipping became essential. House Marina adapted.

He's a survivor rather than a conqueror. His house was nearly destroyed during the Passing when twenty of their fishing boats disappeared in a single night. Quintus rebuilt through caution and diversification, never committing everything to any single venture.

His sailors report strange things in the water. Quintus believes them—he's also seen things that don't match any creature he knows. He's the only great house head taking the sea's changes seriously. The others think he's superstitious.

**Appearance:** Heavyset, salt-weathered, with a fisherman's squint even indoors. His hands are permanently rough from years handling nets before he became too important for physical work.

**Mannerisms:**
- Checks weather before making any decision
- Trusts the sea more than he trusts people
- Collects sailor stories about strange phenomena
- Prays before meals (sincere, not performance)

### Goal

To keep his people alive and his house functional until he understands what's happening and can respond appropriately.

**Immediate objectives:**
- Map the changes in fishing grounds
- Establish communication with undersea peoples (Ti-Abzu)
- Prepare for whatever the sea is bringing
- Protect the fleet from threats no one else believes exist

### Complication

Quintus has made contact with the Ti-Abzu. They've been leaving messages in sealed bottles near his fishing grounds—warnings, he thinks, though interpretation is difficult. They want to meet properly, somewhere safe. He doesn't know if he should pursue this alone or bring other houses (or the Council) into the communication.

The secrets he's learning suggest something catastrophic is approaching from the deep. He doesn't know how to warn people who don't believe in "fish stories."

# Part Three: Goals & Tensions

## Primary Goal

**Trade Continuity and Expansion**

The houses exist to trade. All their power derives from moving goods that people need. Their primary goal is simply to keep commerce functioning—and to expand their share of it whenever possible.

## Secondary Goals

- **Consolidation:** Absorb weaker competitors, control more of the supply chain
- **Political Influence:** Ensure the Council of Captains serves house interests
- **Risk Management:** Prepare for various catastrophic scenarios (war, plague, famine)
- **Succession:** Prepare the next generation to maintain family power

## Internal Tensions

### Inter-House Competition
The five great houses are rivals before allies. Price wars, marriage contests, and market manipulation are constant. The Council provides a venue for managing this competition but not eliminating it.

### Generational Conflict
The heads of houses are survivors who built through crisis. Their heirs grew up with wealth and expectation. Many young heirs want faster profits, modern methods, or entirely different lives. Succession is a looming crisis for every house.

### Values Drift
The old trading values—fair dealing, reputation maintenance, long-term thinking—conflict with the short-term opportunities the chaos creates. Some houses (Varro especially) have abandoned the old ways. Others resist. The resulting culture clash affects every partnership.

## External Tensions

### Imperial Authority
The Regency Council claims tax authority over the houses. The houses provide tax revenue that keeps the Council functioning. Neither trusts the other. At some point, Imperial ambitions may conflict with commercial independence.

### Foreign Competition
The Shiranui Consortium is the primary external threat—sophisticated, well-capitalized, and increasingly aggressive. Whoever controls eastern trade controls the future. House Caelum currently holds this position, but the Consortium is working to change that.

### Environmental Change
The sea is changing. Fishing grounds have shifted. Ships report strange phenomena. Quintus Marinus takes this seriously; others dismiss it as sailor superstition. If the changes are real and significant, the houses' maritime-dependent model may be threatened.

# Part Four: Assets & Resources

## Material Resources

| House        | Primary Assets                       | Secondary Assets                       |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| **Caelum**   | 23 trading vessels, eastern contacts | Warehouses, insurance investments      |
| **Petronia** | 4 major shipyards, dry docks         | Timber reserves, skilled workforce     |
| **Varro**    | Salt works, preservation facilities  | Food storage, distribution network     |
| **Marina**   | 80+ fishing boats, coastal vessels   | Processing facilities, local knowledge |
| **Fortuna**  | Glass works (Portus Vitrum)          | Specialty craft workshops              |

**Combined Fleet:** ~150 vessels of various types
**Combined Employment:** ~15,000 direct; ~30,000 dependent
**Combined Treasury:** Unknown (each house guards its finances), but collectively substantial

## Institutional Power

**The Weighing House:** The merchant court where disputes are resolved. Controlled by major house appointees.

**Banking Networks:** Houses provide credit, currency exchange, and storage services. This financial infrastructure is essential to commerce.

**Guild Relationships:** The houses need guild labor; the guilds need house contracts. This mutual dependency creates stable (if tense) partnerships.

## Intelligence & Secrets

**Trade Intelligence:** Each house maintains networks of agents reporting on competitors, markets, and political developments.

**External Contacts:** House Caelum's Shiranui relationship; House Marina's undersea contact; House Fortuna's secrets of glass-making.

**Mutual Surveillance:** The houses spy on each other constantly. Everyone knows everyone else's secrets—which creates a kind of stability through mutual blackmail.

# Part Five: Relationships

| Faction                 | Relationship  | Notes                                       |
| ----------------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Council of Captains** | Controlling   | The five great captains are the house heads |
| **Guilds**              | Dependent     | Need each other; don't trust each other     |
| **Shiranui Consortium** | Complex       | Essential partner; potential threat         |
| **Regency Council**     | Uneasy        | Tax disputes; mutual need                   |
| **Church Hierarchy**    | Transactional | Religion matters less than commerce         |
| **Admiral Severinus**   | Complicated   | Need protection; fear military ambition     |

# Part Six: Adventure Hooks

## 1. The Shipyard Sabotage

**Situation:** Ships built at Petronia yards are failing at sea—structural weaknesses causing holds to flood and vessels to founder. Marcus Petronius doesn't know about his son's fraud yet, but he suspects sabotage by competitors. He's hiring investigators to find the source.

**The Question:** Is this sabotage or fraud? Can the truth be discovered without destroying House Petronia—or should it be destroyed?

**Complications:**
- Gaius Petronius will try to frame competitors
- Some ships with weakened hulls are still at sea
- Exposing the fraud might cause panic and economic damage
- Covering it up means more sailors may die
- Marcus's reaction to the truth is unpredictable

## 2. The Salt War

**Situation:** Helena Varro is moving to acquire the last independent salt producers on the coast. One producer, the Covenant of Salis (an ancient salt-harvesting collective with religious protection), is resisting. Varro is applying pressure through every available means. The Covenant has asked outsiders for help.

**The Question:** Can a small traditional producer survive against a great house? Should they? What methods are acceptable in resisting economic conquest?

**Complications:**
- The Covenant's "religious protection" comes from old treaties the Church may not honor
- Varro has legitimate grievances (the Covenant has violated past agreements)
- Other houses might support the Covenant to weaken Varro
- The workers in Varro enterprises deserve consideration too
- The Covenant has secrets about salt that Varro would kill for

## 3. The Deep Warning

**Situation:** Quintus Marinus has decoded enough of the Ti-Abzu messages to understand: something is rising from the deepest trenches. Something that could threaten all surface shipping. He needs to warn the other houses, but they don't believe in "sea monsters." He wants proof that can't be dismissed.

**The Question:** What's rising from the deep? Can evidence be gathered safely? And how do you convince practical merchants to prepare for the impossible?

**Complications:**
- The Ti-Abzu's communication style is elliptical and confusing
- Gathering evidence means going where ships have vanished
- Other houses might use Quintus's "superstition" against him politically
- The threat may be more immediate than anyone realizes
- Preparing for the undersea threat requires resources other houses won't commit

## 4. The Inheritance Crisis

**Situation:** Old Cassius Fortunatus of House Fortuna has died without clear succession. Three claimants have emerged: his legitimate son (incompetent), his illegitimate daughter (capable but scorned), and a distant cousin (supported by House Varro for their own reasons). The glass monopoly—and the secret formulas it protects—is at stake.

**The Question:** Who should inherit? And who really poisoned old Cassius?

**Complications:**
- The legitimate son isn't just incompetent—he's corrupt, working with the Consortium
- The illegitimate daughter knows the glass secrets but is legally excluded
- The cousin is a Varro puppet who would destroy formulas that compete with salt
- Someone in the house definitely murdered the patriarch
- The Consortium is also interested in the outcome
