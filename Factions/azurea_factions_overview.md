# Part One: Religious Factions

## The Solarian Church

**Type:** Religious | **Status:** Fractured | **Scope:** Imperial

The dominant religious institution of the Empire, officially worshipping the "one true Light." Since the Passing, the Church has splintered into competing factions while maintaining a façade of unity. The Supreme Pontiff (Luminary Aldric VII) is secretly incapacitated, and his pronouncements are forged by the Conclave of Flames. The Church's failure to prevent the catastrophe has shattered its moral authority, though its institutional power persists through inertia and the lack of alternatives.

**Sub-Factions:**

### The Hierarchy
The official Church leadership based in Vandgwyn. They maintain institutional control through bureaucratic momentum and the fiction of Papal authority. Corrupt, wealthy, and focused on preserving power rather than serving the faithful.

### The Scouring
Militant zealots who believe the Passing was punishment for insufficient piety. They burn "heretics"—a category that has expanded to include non-humans, folk practitioners, and anyone questioning Church authority. Unofficially supported by Cardinal Draconis.

### The Flagellants
Wandering penitents seeking redemption through self-inflicted pain. They accidentally tap the emergent Blood Field, gaining power through suffering. Some who weep find peace not from God but from Katiari, the forgotten sister who answers sorrow with relief.

### The Monastics
Contemplative orders who have withdrawn from worldly affairs to preserve authentic faith and knowledge. They maintain libraries, copy manuscripts, and quietly shelter those questioning official doctrine.

### The Academics
Scholars secretly questioning Church doctrine and studying forbidden texts. Many shelter in Lexium under the University's protection. They represent the intellectual opposition to orthodoxy.

---

## The Theosyn Revival

**Type:** Religious | **Status:** Emerging | **Scope:** Imperial (Underground)

The old gods—converted to "saints" by the Solarian Church—are waking up and remembering their true names. Shrines abandoned for centuries are receiving visitors again. The "Devil's Doors" (north-facing entrances sealed by the Church) are being quietly unsealed. Some Theosyn are willing to forgive the theft of their identities; others want revenge. The theological implications of this revival could shatter what remains of social order.

---

## The Axis Faith

**Type:** Religious | **Status:** Active | **Scope:** Regional (North)

The dwarven tradition centered on balance, transformation, and the Storm Realm of Gwenaelle. The Axis Faith teaches that power flows through exchange—nothing is given without something taken, and the universe maintains equilibrium through endless transaction. Based primarily in the High Marches around Nordgard, the faith has influenced the character of the entire northern region.

---

## The Ostaran Tradition

**Type:** Religious | **Status:** Active | **Scope:** Imperial (Underground in most regions)

The tradition of Death, ancestors, and endings. Ostarans know that death is not an ending but a transition—souls return to Ostara's realm to rest, remember, and eventually re-emerge. They tend the dead, communicate with ancestors, and maintain the boundary between the living and the passed. The tradition persists despite Church suppression, particularly among the Underworld peoples.

---

## The Revnan Tradition

**Type:** Religious | **Status:** Persecuted | **Scope:** Imperial (Hidden)

The tradition of Darkness, depth, and hidden truth. The Revnan understand that light blinds as well as reveals, and that some truths can only be found in shadow. Revnan practices were demonized by the Solarian Church, transforming a legitimate spiritual tradition into the official enemy. Practitioners hide their faith, but the tradition persists among the Urkhani (shadow-kin) and those who seek wisdom the Church forbids.

---

## The Alysian Tradition (Folk Practice)

**Type:** Religious | **Status:** Resurgent | **Scope:** Regional (West, Rural areas)

The oldest continuous spiritual practice in the Empire—veneration of the land, the seasons, and the Fae who tend Alys's sleeping form. The tradition follows the Wheel of the Year with its eight festivals, maintains shrines at natural features, and practices reciprocity with the spirits. Never fully suppressed, it survived by wearing Church vestments when necessary. Since the Passing, folk practice has reasserted itself openly in many areas.

# Part Two: Political Factions (Imperial)

## The Regency Council

**Type:** Political | **Status:** Fragile | **Scope:** Imperial (Nominal), Regional (Actual)

The governing body of Aurheim, ruling in the name of an Emperor who disappeared during the Passing. Led by Lord Regent Valerius Corbulo, the Council includes military commanders, Church representatives, and treasury officials. They claim Imperial authority but actually control perhaps a twenty-mile radius around the capital. The Council survives because its members are better at preventing each other from seizing power than at actually governing. Their greatest strength is that no one has a better alternative.

**Key Members:**
- Lord Regent Valerius Corbulo (Senior minister, decent but ineffective)
- General Aurelia Corvinus (Military commander, competent but frustrated)
- Grand Adjudicator Vespera Noctis (Inquisition head, zealot becoming Blood-touched)

**Primary Sources:**

---

## The Church Hierarchy (Vandgwyn)

**Type:** Political/Religious | **Status:** Contested | **Scope:** Imperial (Claims), Regional (Reality)

The Solarian Church's central authority, increasingly asserting temporal power as secular authority collapses. The Conclave of Flames—twelve cardinals who officially advise the Luminary—actually runs the Church through forged pronouncements. Key figures include Cardinal Augustinus Theron (conservative caretaker), Cardinal Seraphina Valens (reformist), and Cardinal Marcus Draconis (orthodox hardliner). The Hierarchy's power rests on institutional momentum and the desperate human need for order.

---

## The Bridge (Castellum Pontem)

**Type:** Political | **Status:** Independent | **Scope:** Strategic Point

Commander Marcella Ironhand controls the Great Bridge over the Mere of Crowns—the primary crossing between Aurheim and Vandgwyn. She declared neutrality when both capitals demanded her loyalty, established toll collection for the garrison's maintenance, and made clear that any attempt to seize the bridge will result in its destruction. The Bridge has effectively seceded, functioning as a neutral trading post and choke point. Marcella doesn't want to rule the Empire; she wants to keep her people alive.

# Part Three: Political Factions (Regional)

## The Council of Captains

**Type:** Political/Economic | **Status:** Active | **Scope:** Regional (Golden Coast)

When the Empire collapsed, the merchant families and ship captains of Portus Aureus formed an emergency committee that has become the de facto government of the Golden Coast. The Council includes five Great Captains (trading house heads), the Harbor Master, the Admiral, the Guild Speaker, and a rotating Foreign Consul. Decisions require majority vote, but the Great Captains hold real power. The system works only because the alternative is worse.

**Key Members:**
- Aurelia Caela (First Captain, House Caelum, de facto leader)
- Admiral Marcus Severinus (Naval commander, Imperial loyalist)
- Mei Ling-Feng (Shiranui Factor, foreign influence)

---

## The Duke of Oakhold

**Type:** Political | **Status:** Entangled | **Scope:** Regional (Kingswood)

Duke Arthyen ap Cadwgan rules Caerderw and the Kingswood with the forest's permission. His bloodline carries ancient arrangements with the Fae—protection in exchange for respect, power in exchange for service. He can walk where the forest is closed to others. His judgments are enforced by things that are not human. He is not a tyrant, but he is not entirely his own. When the forest demands, he obeys. Since the Passing, he has grown withdrawn, spending hours in chambers no servant has seen, speaking to counselors no one else can perceive.

---

## The Northern Jarls

**Type:** Political | **Status:** Fragmented | **Scope:** Regional (North)

The northern provinces are governed by a loose confederation of Jarls—hereditary lords who owe nominal allegiance to the Empire but have always maintained significant autonomy. The Passing has made them effectively independent, each Jarl governing their own territory according to local custom. Some maintain Imperial traditions; others have reverted entirely to older Norse-influenced practices. The most significant is the Fjordhavn Admiral, who has forged a controversial peace with Ynys Wyllt.

# Part Four: Economic Factions

## The Major Trading Houses

**Type:** Economic | **Status:** Consolidating | **Scope:** Coastal Regions

The great merchant families who controlled inter-regional and international trade before the Passing. Many collapsed when their principals died, their ships were lost, or their trade routes were severed. The survivors have consolidated, absorbing the assets of the fallen and emerging stronger than before. Houses like the Caelum of Portus Aureus now wield power rivaling that of provincial governors.

**Primary Sources:**
- [Golden Coast Development](file:///d:/local-repos/Azurea/Geography/regions/azurea_golden_coast_development.md)

---

## The Guilds

**Type:** Economic | **Status:** Strengthening | **Scope:** Local

Craft and trade guilds have become more powerful as other institutions weakened. The Furnace Masters of Portus Vitrum control glass production with jealous secrecy. The Salt Masters maintain their ancient Covenant of neutrality. The Weighers of Portus Aureus adjudicate all commercial disputes. Guilds provide employment, security, and a framework for life that doesn't require believing in things that failed.

**Primary Sources:**
- [Golden Coast Development](file:///d:/local-repos/Azurea/Geography/regions/azurea_golden_coast_development.md)

---

## The Shiranui Consortium

**Type:** Economic/Political | **Status:** Expanding | **Scope:** International

The primary organization of Shiranui merchants operating in Imperial territories. Based in their sealed compound in Portus Aureus, the Consortium maintains the only reliable connection to eastern trade. Their senior representative, Mei Ling-Feng, has lived in the Empire for thirty years and understands both cultures. However, her orders from home have become increasingly aggressive, pushing for dominance rather than partnership. The Consortium's growing influence is both an opportunity and a threat.

# Part Five: Cultural & Racial Factions

## The Goleuwyr (Elves)

**Type:** Cultural/Racial | **Status:** Hidden | **Scope:** Scattered

The children of Bronwyn's Light Tree, refugees from the God-Giant War. The Solarian Church ironically persecutes them as "soulless" despite their actual Light-realm origin. Most Goleuwyr hide their nature, passing as human where possible. Communities persist in hidden enclaves like the Garden of the Dawn near Portus Aureus. The Elvish Pale represents the most visible Goleuwyr population, though even there they maintain careful distance from human affairs.

- [Elvish Pale Development](file:///d:/local-repos/Azurea/Geography/regions/azurea_elvish_pale_development.md)

---

## The Urkhani (Shadow-kin)

**Type:** Cultural/Racial | **Status:** Persecuted | **Scope:** Hidden

The children of Revna's Dark Tree, refugees like the elves but far more thoroughly demonized. The Church teaches that the Urkhani are literally demons—a position that has justified centuries of persecution. In truth, they are simply people attuned to shadow and depth, no more evil than elvish attunement to light makes elves holy. Urkhani communities survive in the deep places where the Church cannot reach.

---

## The Dragon-Kin Hegemony

**Type:** Cultural/Racial | **Status:** Withdrawn | **Scope:** Regional (South)

The descendants and servants of the Dragons who withdrew during the God-Giant War. The Hegemony once dominated the southern continent; now it has largely retreated into ancestral territories, emerging rarely to engage with human affairs. Their philosophy—that true rule is knowing when not to rule—has shaped their post-Passing response: patience, observation, and careful intervention only where necessary.

# Part Six: Undersea & Underworld Factions

## The Ti-Abzu

**Type:** Cultural/Racial | **Status:** Active | **Scope:** Undersea

The humanoid people of the mid-depths—human-adjacent in form but adapted to underwater life. They maintain cities in the twilight zone where light still penetrates, trading with surface peoples and mediating between the upper and lower realms. The Ti-Abzu are concerned about something stirring in the deep trenches and have begun reaching out to surface allies.

**Primary Sources:**
- [Depths Realm Overview](file:///d:/local-repos/Azurea/Cosmology%20%26%20Global%20Mechanics/06_Depths_Atargatis/Realm_Overview.md)

---

## The Abgal-Tako (Cephalopod Sages)

**Type:** Cultural/Racial | **Status:** Active | **Scope:** Undersea

The wise ones of the deep—beings of tentacle and alien intelligence who serve as keepers of undersea knowledge. The Tako rarely interact with surface peoples, making their recent request for a meeting at the Amber Wreck unprecedented. They know something about what's wrong with the sea, but extracting that knowledge will require careful negotiation.

---

## The Rot-Wendan (Decay-Turners)

**Type:** Cultural/Racial | **Status:** Gorging | **Scope:** Underworld

Fungal people who consume spiritual corruption, maintaining the world's spiritual health through decomposition. They dwell in Rotmunð, accessed through the Spiral in the Kingswood. Since the Passing, they've been gorging on unprecedented levels of corruption, expanding desperately to process the spiritual pollution. Some have begun consuming Reft-corruption, but it's changing them in ways they don't understand.

---

## The Eald-Delfen (Deep Dwarves)

**Type:** Cultural/Racial | **Status:** Hidden | **Scope:** Underworld

The spirit-bearing children of Ostara's Death Tree, distinct from the mountain dwarves of the Axis Faith. The Eald-Delfen serve as guides for the dead and watchers at the boundary between life and death. They dwell deep beneath the surface, in cities carved from living rock, maintaining ancient compacts with Ostara herself.

---

## The Gastberend

**Type:** Cultural/Racial | **Status:** Active | **Scope:** Underworld

Hospitality-spirits who dwell at crossroads and thresholds, offering shelter to travelers in exchange for news and stories. The Gastberend maintain way-stations in the Underworld, serving as neutral ground where enemies may meet in peace.
