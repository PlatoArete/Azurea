The Gastberend—the "Host-Spirits" or "Hospitality-Bearers"—are entities that dwell in the sacred space of welcome. They inhabit the threshold between outside and inside, the moment when a stranger becomes a guest, the transformation from isolation to community.

They are not ghosts or undead; they're a different category of being—spirits that embody the concept of hospitality in its most ancient and binding form. When a host says "enter and be welcome," a Gastberend may be listening. When a guest abuses hospitality, a Gastberend may respond.

In the old days, before the Church, hospitality had weight: offering shelter to a traveler created real obligations on both sides. The Gastberend enforced those obligations. The Church suppressed this "superstition," but the spirits never left. They've merely become quieter—and hungrier—as the traditions that fed them faded.

Since the Passing, with so many displaced and seeking shelter, the Gastberend have become more active than they've been in centuries.

# Part One: Nature & Purpose

## What the Gastberend Are

The Gastberend exist at the intersection of physical spaces and social bonds:

**Spiritual Nature:**
- Manifest at thresholds, hearths, and places where hospitality is offered
- Perceive the sacred compact between host and guest
- Feed on the energy of genuine welcome (or violated trust)
- Neither alive nor dead in the usual sense—they're incarnated concepts

**Physical Manifestations:**
- Usually invisible to ordinary perception
- Can appear as warming presence, watching eyes in firelight, protective shadow
- May manifest more visibly when hospitality is honored or violated
- Strong manifestations reported as kindly elders, fierce guardians, or something stranger

**The Binding Force:**
When hospitality is properly offered and accepted, the Gastberend witness it. This witnessing creates a binding—the host must protect, the guest must not harm. Breaking this binding has consequences that humans may not see coming but will certainly feel.

## Types of Gastberend

| Type                    | Focus                     | Manifestation                    |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Threshold Guardians** | The door, the entrance    | Protective presence at entries   |
| **Hearth-Keepers**      | The fire, the warmth      | Comfort and safety by the fire   |
| **Bread-Saints**        | The shared meal           | Blessing on food given to guests |
| **Roof-Watchers**       | The shelter itself        | Protection of the dwelling       |
| **Way-Markers**         | The road between shelters | Guidance to safe harbor          |

## The Sacred Compact

The Gastberend understand hospitality through the ancient triple obligation:

**The Host's Obligations:**
1. Offer shelter from the outside (roof, warmth, safety)
2. Offer sustenance (bread, water, what can be spared)
3. Protect the guest as family while they remain

**The Guest's Obligations:**
1. Accept only what is freely offered
2. Harm nothing of the host's while under protection
3. Honor the home with respect and eventual departure

**The Compact's Duration:**
Protection extends for three days traditionally, or until the guest leaves and the bond is released. During this time, violations by either party invite Gastberend response.

# Part Two: Structure & Relationships

## Organization (or Lack Thereof)

The Gastberend don't have society in any conventional sense. They're more like a distributed awareness:

**Collective Consciousness:**
All Gastberend share a kind of awareness—violations and honors in one place echo across the network. A particularly egregious violation of hospitality may attract response from distant spirits.

**Local Anchoring:**
Each Gastberend has a primary location—a specific hearth, threshold, or way-station where their presence is strongest. They can manifest elsewhere but are weakest far from their anchors.

## Key Manifestations

### The Elder of Crossroads (Collective)

| Attribute  | Value                                           |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Title**  | The Elder of Crossroads                         |
| **Nature** | Collective manifestation of way-marking spirits |
| **Age**    | Timeless                                        |

**Character:** The Elder appears at crossroads when travelers are lost or in danger—an ancient figure offering direction to shelter. Those who follow its guidance find safety. Those who ignore it often don't.

It's not a single being but a manifestation that multiple Gastberend can produce together when the need is strong. Since the Passing, the Elder has appeared more frequently—so many people displaced, so many needing guidance.

The Elder doesn't speak so much as indicate. It points toward shelter, warns away from danger, and shows paths that shouldn't exist but do. Those who encounter it remember the experience as dream-like but real.

**Purpose:** To guide the lost toward hospitality.

**Complication:** The Elder sometimes guides travelers toward shelters that are not what they seem—places that offer hospitality but exact prices the guest doesn't expect.

### The Wrath of Violated Trust

| Attribute  | Value                                      |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Title**  | The Wrath (various forms)                  |
| **Nature** | Manifestation when hospitality is violated |
| **Age**    | Timeless                                   |

**Character:** When a guest murders their host, when a host sells their guest to enemies, when the sacred compact is fundamentally betrayed—the Wrath appears. It's not a specific entity but what happens when Gastberend rage becomes visible.

The Wrath has no personality. It's elemental response: the walls closing in, the fire turning hungry, the roof that was shelter becoming trap. Those who experience it rarely survive, and the tales of those who witness it ensure the message spreads.

**Purpose:** To punish violation of hospitality's sacred compact.

**Complication:** The Wrath doesn't distinguish intended violation from accident. Sometimes guests harm hosts without meaning to. Sometimes hosts fail guests through circumstance rather than will. The Wrath cares about outcome, not intention.

### Grandmother Welcome

| Attribute  | Value                                       |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Title**  | Grandmother Welcome                         |
| **Nature** | Ancient spirit bound to a specific location |
| **Age**    | 400+ years at current anchor                |

**Character:** Grandmother Welcome is a specific, named Gastberend with unusual individual identity. She's anchored to an inn in the Midlands—the same inn for four centuries, though the building has been rebuilt several times. She manifests as a kindly elder offering warmth and food, though she's entirely spirit.

She's become something of a legend: travelers know to seek "Grandmother's Inn" when they need genuine sanctuary. The innkeepers across generations have learned to maintain the traditions she requires, and in exchange, their establishment has flourished.

She's also accumulated unusual awareness. Four centuries of hosting has given her knowledge of traveler patterns, political movements, and the great sweeps of history. She remembers the Passing, the plagues before it, the wars before them. She understands the current crisis in context.

**Purpose:** To maintain ideal hospitality as example and sanctuary.

**Complication:** Grandmother Welcome is worried. The traditions that let her exist are fading. Fewer hosts understand the obligations. Fewer guests respect them. Without the compact, she'll weaken and eventually fade. She's trying to teach what she knows, but who's listening?

# Part Three: Goals & Function

## Primary Purpose

**Enforce the Hospitality Compact**

Above everything, the Gastberend exist to ensure hospitality functions. They reward proper hosting and guesting; they punish violations. This isn't about good and evil—it's about the sacred rules that make civilization possible when people must rely on strangers.

## What They Want

- **Recognition:** Acknowledgment that hospitality has spiritual weight
- **Observance:** Proper performance of hosting and guesting duties
- **Feeding:** The energy of genuine welcome sustains them
- **Teaching:** Transmission of traditions to new generations

## Current Concerns

### Fading Traditions
Modern humans have forgotten the sacred compact. They offer hospitality as mere convenience rather than binding obligation. Without proper observance, the Gastberend weaken.

### Desperate Times
The Passing has created unprecedented displacement. Millions are seeking shelter they can't find. The need for hospitality vastly exceeds the supply. Gastberend feel this imbalance acutely.

### Violations Increasing
When resources are scarce, hospitality fails. Hosts turn away guests who would have been welcomed before. Guests steal from hosts who've given all they can. The compact breaks down, and the Gastberend respond—but response feeds the cycle of failure.

# Part Four: Assets & Resources

## Spiritual Resources

| Capability     | Expression                                       |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Blessing**   | Strengthening hosts who honor the compact        |
| **Guidance**   | Leading travelers to safe shelter                |
| **Protection** | Shielding guests and hosts from external threats |
| **Warning**    | Alerting to those who approach with ill intent   |
| **Punishment** | Responding to violations of the compact          |

## Limitations

**Binding Rules:** The Gastberend operate within strict limits:
- They cannot force hospitality—only witness and respond
- They cannot punish without violation
- They cannot manifest strongly without nearby anchor
- They cannot teach directly—only demonstrate

**Declining Power:** As traditions fade, Gastberend abilities weaken. Some have faded entirely from locations where no one remembers the old ways.

# Part Six: Adventure Hooks

## 1. The Violated Compact

**Situation:** A noble in the Midlands has been found dead—killed in his own hall after offering shelter to travelers. The official story is murder by ungrateful guests. But the death matches Gastberend punishment: walls that crushed, fire that consumed selectively. Was the noble secretly violating hospitality? Or are the guests wrongly accused?

**The Question:** Who violated the compact? What actually happened under that roof? And can the truth be determined when the spirits themselves may have administered justice?

**Complications:**
- The noble's family wants the guests executed regardless of truth
- The guests claim innocence and seem genuinely confused
- The Gastberend involved won't (or can't) explain what they witnessed
- Someone else at the hall may have triggered the response
- The truth may be worse than either obvious interpretation

## 2. The Fading Inn

**Situation:** Grandmother Welcome is dying—fading as the traditions that sustain her weaken. The current innkeeper doesn't understand or believe in the old ways. The inn's legendary safety is disappearing. Travelers who relied on it are suffering. Someone needs to either teach the innkeeper or find another way to sustain the ancient spirit.

**The Question:** Can Grandmother Welcome be saved? What would that require? And what happens to centuries of accumulated wisdom if she fades?

**Complications:**
- The innkeeper considers the old ways superstition; convincing him is difficult
- Grandmother Welcome is too weak to manifest convincingly
- Other parties might want her knowledge—or want her gone
- Saving her may require sacrifices the innkeeper isn't willing to make
- Her fading may be natural—not everything can be preserved

## 3. The False Sanctuary

**Situation:** Someone is creating false sanctuaries—places that appear to offer hospitality but actually exploit desperate travelers. The victims are disappearing: robbed, enslaved, or worse. The Gastberend should be responding, but something is blocking them from the locations.

**The Question:** Who's creating the false sanctuaries? How are they blocking Gastberend response? And what's happening to the taken travelers?

**Complications:**
- The operation is sophisticated and well-funded
- Blocking Gastberend requires knowledge most don't have
- The travelers are being taken somewhere for some purpose
- Someone with legitimate hospitality knowledge is helping
- The operation may connect to larger post-Passing trafficking

## 4. The Elder's Path

**Situation:** The Elder of Crossroads has appeared to a party of refugees, guiding them toward a destination no one expected: a hidden location where "true hospitality" still exists. The refugees are following, but the path leads into dangerous territory. What is the Elder guiding them toward?

**The Question:** Where is the Elder leading? Is the destination genuinely safe? And why is this guidance being offered now?

**Complications:**
- Following the Elder means trusting an entity with unclear motives
- The path's dangers are real regardless of the destination
- The "true hospitality" may have requirements the refugees can't meet
- Other parties are tracking the refugees
- The Elder may be manifesting unusually for reasons no one understands
