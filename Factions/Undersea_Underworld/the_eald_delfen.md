The Eald-Delfen—the "Deep Dwarves"—are the dwarven kindred who went down when others went across. While surface and mountain dwarves integrated with human domains, built the Mountain Gate relationships, and practiced the Axis Faith, their deeper cousins delved into places sunlight never reached.

They found chambers vast as kingdoms, minerals unknown on the surface, and wonders that had never been seen by any eye. They also found dangers: pressure, isolation, things that live in the dark and do not welcome visitors. They adapted to all of these, becoming something both recognizably dwarven and distinctly other.

Contact between surface dwarves and their deep kindred has always been limited—the depths make travel difficult, and cultural drift has made communication challenging. Since the Passing, however, the Eald-Delfen have been reaching upward more frequently. Something below even them is stirring, and the deep may not remain safe.

# Part One: Nature & Culture

## What the Eald-Delfen Are

The Eald-Delfen are biologically dwarves, adapted over millennia to conditions no surface dweller could endure:

**Physical Adaptations:**
- Smaller than surface dwarves (efficiency in tight spaces)
- Larger eyes, sensitive to minimal light
- Enhanced thermal regulation (the deep is cold)
- Pressure tolerance beyond surface-dweller capacity
- Reduced need for food (slow metabolism in resource-scarce environment)

**Cultural Adaptations:**
- Extreme self-sufficiency (no rescue coming if something goes wrong)
- Sound-based communication in total darkness
- Mineral-focused diet (supplements true food with trace elements)
- Clan structures adapted for small populations
- Time measured by geological processes rather than solar cycles

## The Deep Reaches

The Eald-Delfen inhabit multiple deep settlements connected by tunnels that span hundreds of miles:

| Settlement              | Depth    | Character                   | Status       |
| ----------------------- | -------- | --------------------------- | ------------ |
| **The Deephold**        | 3+ miles | Capital, largest population | Stable       |
| **Ember Hall**          | 2 miles  | Thermal vents, heat source  | Thriving     |
| **The Crystal Gardens** | 4 miles  | Mining, mineral wealth      | Active       |
| **Silence Rest**        | Unknown  | Deepest known settlement    | Lost contact |
| **The Upward Gate**     | 1 mile   | Surface-dwarf interface     | Growing      |

## Cultural Values

| Value             | Expression                                          |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Depth**         | The deeper, the closer to truth and worth           |
| **Stone-Song**    | Rock speaks to those who listen; mining is dialogue |
| **Self-Reliance** | Depend on no one but clan-kin                       |
| **Slow Time**     | Patience measured in generations                    |
| **Memory-Stone**  | Carving history into walls that will last forever   |

# Part Two: Structure & Leadership

## Organization

Eald-Delfen society is organized through Clans and Guilds, with minimal central authority:

```
The Deep Moot (Gathering of clan heads)
    ↓
Clan Heads (Leaders of major family groups)
    ↓
Guild Masters (Specialists in particular crafts)
    ↓
Journeydwarves (Trained adults)
    ↓
Younglings (Children and apprentices)
```

**The Deep Moot:**
When matters affect all Eald-Delfen, clan heads gather at the Deephold for the Deep Moot. This happens rarely—perhaps once per generation under normal circumstances. Recent events have required more frequent meetings.

## Current Leadership

| Position      | Name                  | Notes                                          |
| ------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Deep King     | Thorgar Ironvein      | Elected leader during crisis; temporary title  |
| Stone-Speaker | Grandmother Feldspar  | Interpreter of stone-song; spiritual authority |
| Gate Warden   | Brunhild Hammerfall   | Manages surface contact                        |
| Mine-Master   | Forge-Father Obsidian | Resource extraction coordinator                |

## Key Figures

### Deep King Thorgar Ironvein

| Attribute | Value                               |
| --------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Title** | Deep King (crisis title)            |
| **Role**  | Unified leadership during emergency |
| **Age**   | 203                                 |

**Character:** The Eald-Delfen haven't had a king for six generations—the title exists only for emergencies requiring unified command. Thorgar's election indicates how seriously the clans take current circumstances.

He's a practical dwarf, a former mine-master who rose through demonstrated competence rather than politics. He doesn't enjoy power; he accepted it because the alternative was watching his people make fragmented responses to coordinated threats.

His primary concern is the Lower Reaches—the territories below even Eald-Delfen settlements. Something down there is moving. Exploratory shafts have been destroyed. Scouts haven't returned. The thing or things in the uttermost depth have become active in ways they haven't been for millennia.

**Goal:** To protect the Eald-Delfen from the threat rising from below, using whatever alliances or resources prove necessary.

**Complication:** Thorgar's authority is temporary and contested. Some clans believe the threat is exaggerated—a power grab using fear. Others believe he's not acting aggressively enough. Unified action is difficult when significant portions of the population question whether unity is needed.

### Stone-Speaker Grandmother Feldspar

| Attribute | Value                                          |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Title** | Stone-Speaker of the Deephold                  |
| **Role**  | Spiritual authority; interpreter of stone-song |
| **Age**   | 312                                            |

**Character:** Feldspar is the eldest living Eald-Delfen and the most skilled practitioner of stone-song—the meditative discipline of listening to what the rock communicates. The stone tells her things: where veins run, where pressure builds, where empty spaces hide. It also tells her about vibrations from far below.

She's heard the movement in the uttermost deep. The stone screams it now—something vast, something wrong, something that shouldn't be waking. She would explain this to the skeptics, but stone-song doesn't translate into words. She can only say "something is wrong" and hope they believe her.

She's the primary advocate for surface contact. The Eald-Delfen can't handle this alone. Their surface cousins, the mountain dwarves, might provide strength. Even humans might contribute something useful. But the deep dwarves have spent generations cultivating self-reliance; asking for help feels like failure.

**Goal:** To make others understand what the stone is telling her before it's too late to act.

**Complication:** Feldspar's stone-song abilities are fading. Not from age—from interference. The wrongness in the deep disrupts the frequencies she reads. She's losing her primary sense at the moment when it's most needed.

### Gate Warden Brunhild Hammerfall

| Attribute | Value                              |
| --------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Title** | Gate Warden of the Upward Passages |
| **Role**  | Manager of surface contact         |
| **Age**   | 89                                 |

**Character:** Brunhild is young by Eald-Delfen standards—barely middle-aged—and considered somewhat radical for her interest in upward rather than downward exploration. She's the one who maintains contact with surface-dwelling dwarves and, increasingly, with humans who might prove useful.

She finds the surface world fascinating: so much space, so much light, so many different peoples with different approaches to existence. Her kin consider this interest eccentric at best, dangerous at worst. Surface contact corrupts deep values.

She's been building relationships with Jarl Grimnar Ironforge of the High Marches, establishing trust that might become alliance. If the deep threat reaches upward, the surface will need warning. If the Eald-Delfen need help, someone upward will need to respond.

**Goal:** To build surface alliances that serve deep interests.

**Complication:** Brunhild has discovered something disturbing: the Mountain Gate dwarves have religious obligations (Axis Faith) that the Eald-Delfen have completely abandoned. Her people worship nothing, observe no traditions, maintain no spiritual practice. This might be a problem if alliance requires spiritual common ground.

# Part Three: Goals & Tensions

## Primary Goal

**Survive the Rising Threat**

Something in the uttermost depths is waking. The Eald-Delfen's primary goal is ensuring their civilization survives whatever emerges.

## Secondary Goals

- **Intelligence:** Understand what's down there before it reaches inhabitable levels
- **Defense:** Fortify settlements against attack from below
- **Alliance:** Build relationships with surface powers who might help
- **Escape Routes:** Ensure populations can retreat upward if necessary

## Internal Tensions

### Unity vs. Independence
The clans value autonomy. Central leadership is a crisis measure that many resent. Thorgar's authority is constantly questioned.

### Depth vs. Safety
Traditional values honor the deepest delvers. Current circumstance suggests that going deep is increasingly dangerous. Cultural identity conflicts with survival instinct.

### Isolation vs. Contact
The Eald-Delfen have maintained separation from surface-dwellers for generations. Alliance requires opening relationships they've intentionally avoided.

## External Tensions

### Surface Misunderstanding
Surface-dwellers (even Mountain Gate dwarves) don't understand deep conditions or culture. Establishing useful alliance requires bridging significant gaps.

### Religious Disconnect
The Axis Faith that binds surface dwarves has no presence among Eald-Delfen. This creates potential friction with would-be allies.

### The Thing Below
Whatever's rising doesn't negotiate, doesn't communicate, doesn't respond to bargaining. It simply is, and it's coming.

# Part Four: Assets & Resources

## Material Resources

| Resource           | Status        | Notes                                       |
| ------------------ | ------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Settlements**    | Intact        | Deep cities with sophisticated construction |
| **Mineral Wealth** | Vast          | Deposits unknown on surface                 |
| **Infrastructure** | Extensive     | Tunnel networks spanning hundreds of miles  |
| **Manufacturing**  | Sophisticated | Deep-crafted goods of exceptional quality   |

## Military Resources

| Force         | Size   | Notes                           |
| ------------- | ------ | ------------------------------- |
| Clan Warriors | ~3,000 | Every adult trained for defense |
| Deep Guard    | ~500   | Professional soldiers           |
| Sappers       | ~200   | Tunnel warfare specialists      |

**Limitations:** The Eald-Delfen are skilled at fighting in tunnels but have no experience with the vast, unknown threat from below. Their forces are adequate for traditional dangers—cave-ins, hostile fauna, territorial disputes—but may be useless against something on a different scale.

## Unique Capabilities

**Deep-Craft:** Working with materials and in conditions surface smiths can't match:
- Pressure-forged metals with unique properties
- Crystal-craft for light and communication
- Heat-harvesting from thermal vents
- Tunnel engineering at depths others can't survive

**Stone-Song:** The discipline of reading the rock provides:
- Early warning of geological events
- Location of resources and hazards
- Communication across distances through vibration
- Perception of things moving through stone

| ------------------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Mountain Gate Dwarves** | Estranged Kin  | Same ancestry; diverged culture |
| **Jarl Grimnar**          | Potential Ally | Brunhild's primary contact      |
| **Axis Faith**            | Unknown        | No presence among Eald-Delfen   |
| **Surface World**         | Mostly Unknown | Limited surface knowledge       |
| **The Thing Below**       | Threatened By  | Source of current crisis        |

# Part Six: Adventure Hooks

## 1. The Upward Embassy

**Situation:** Thorgar is sending an embassy to the surface—Brunhild and a small party seeking alliance with whatever powers might help. They need surface guides and advocates who can help them navigate a world utterly foreign to their experience.

**The Question:** Can the embassy succeed? What alliance would actually help the Eald-Delfen? And how do you explain deep-threats to people who've never conceived of such things?

**Complications:**
- The embassy members are physically vulnerable to surface conditions (too much light, too much space)
- Surface politics are complex; the Eald-Delfen have no understanding
- What the deep dwarves need may conflict with surface interests
- Some surface powers might exploit rather than help
- Time pressure from below limits negotiation patience

## 2. The Lost Settlement

**Situation:** Silence Rest—the deepest known Eald-Delfen settlement—has gone silent. No messages, no returnees from supply missions, nothing. Thorgar needs to know what happened but can't spare forces from defense. He's willing to hire outsiders for the reconnaissance.

**The Question:** What happened to Silence Rest? Are there survivors? And what waited for the delvers at the uttermost depth?

**Complications:**
- Reaching Silence Rest requires traveling through miles of deep tunnels
- The settlement is at conditions near even Eald-Delfen tolerance limits
- Whatever destroyed the settlement may still be present
- Survivors (if any) may not be in condition to leave
- The knowledge gained may be horrifying

## 3. The Stone Goes Silent

**Situation:** Grandmother Feldspar's stone-song has failed completely—the interference from below has reached the point where she can hear nothing. Without stone-song, the Eald-Delfen lose their primary warning system. She needs help understanding what's disrupting the frequencies and whether restoration is possible.

**The Question:** What's blocking the stone-song? Can it be restored? And what happens as the Eald-Delfen navigate without their oldest sense?

**Complications:**
- The interference may be deliberate—something doesn't want to be perceived
- Investigating the frequencies requires entering the affected zones
- Restoration might require confronting whatever's causing disruption
- Other stone-speakers are also affected; this isn't just Feldspar
- The loss affects more than warnings—stone-song guides everything

## 4. The Faith Question

**Situation:** Brunhild has learned that surface alliance may require religious compatibility—specifically, the Axis Faith observances that Mountain Gate dwarves practice. The Eald-Delfen have no such tradition. Should they adopt/fake practices they don't understand to secure alliance? Or is there another path to trust?

**The Question:** Can the deep dwarves build alliance without shared faith? Should they pretend to beliefs they don't hold? And what would authentic spiritual practice look like for people who've lived so long in lightless depths?

**Complications:**
- Faking faith is dishonest and potentially discoverable
- The Axis Faith may not translate to deep conditions
- Shared values might substitute for shared religion
- Some Eald-Delfen may actually develop genuine faith interest
- The Axis Faith practitioners may not accept non-believers regardless
