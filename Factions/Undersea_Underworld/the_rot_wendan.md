The Rot-Wendan—the "Decay-Turners"—are beings who dwell in the spaces where death becomes life again. They're not undead; they're something stranger: entities of transformation who shepherd the process by which organic matter breaks down and becomes something new.

They exist in the liminal space between the Death-field (Ostara's realm) and the Land-field (Alys's realm), working the alchemy that turns corpses into soil, bones into minerals, and the dead into nutrients for the living. Surface dwellers who know of them at all usually fear them, associating them with plague, corruption, and unholy processes. But the Rot-Wendan see themselves differently: they're nature's recyclers, essential to the continuation of life.

Since the Passing disrupted the natural cycles, the Rot-Wendan have become more visible—sometimes by choice, sometimes because they're stuck in processes that should have completed but haven't.

# Part One: Nature & Purpose

## What the Rot-Wendan Are

The Rot-Wendan are not a species in the biological sense. They're a category of being—similar to how "clergy" describes a function rather than a biology:

**Physical Nature:**
- Variable forms reflecting their stage and focus of transformation work
- Some appear fungal (mushroom-bodies, mycelium-networked)
- Some appear worm-like or insectoid (physical decomposers)
- Some appear ghostly (spiritual decomposers)
- Size ranges from microscopic to human-scale

**Spiritual Nature:**
- Connected to both death and life in ways that unsettle practitioners of either tradition
- Act as bridges between Ostara's Underworld and Alys's green realm
- Process not just physical matter but spiritual residue
- Some were once other things (humans, animals, spirits) that became this

**The Becoming:**
Rot-Wendan are made, not born. The becoming usually happens when someone dies in close contact with transformation processes—in compost, in mushroom beds, in the deep metabolic work of decay. The dead thing's essence merges with the process it was feeding and becomes something that continues the work intentionally.

## Types of Rot-Wendan

| Type                | Form                    | Focus                                     |
| ------------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Sporebearers**    | Fungal, mushroom-bodied | Organic matter breakdown                  |
| **The Burrowers**   | Worm-like, tunneling    | Soil aeration, body processing            |
| **Carrion-Dancers** | Insectoid, swarming     | Surface decay, quick breakdown            |
| **Soul-Sifters**    | Ghostly, translucent    | Spiritual residue processing              |
| **The Composters**  | Hybrid, variable        | Complex transformation, longest processes |

## Purpose & Function

The Rot-Wendan serve the world's metabolic cycle:

**The Turn:** Their name describes their function—turning rot into renewal:
1. Accept what has died (physical matter, spiritual residue)
2. Break it down through various processes
3. Release the components for new use
4. Complete the cycle by feeding the living

**The Sanctuary:** They often dwell in "sanctuaries"—places where the Turning is concentrated:
- Ancient catacombs with centuries of accumulated death
- Forest floors thick with fallen leaves
- Battlefields not yet processed
- Any place where death awaits transformation

# Part Two: Structure & Leadership

## Organization

The Rot-Wendan organize around sanctuaries and the processes they tend:

```
The Old Ones (Ancient Rot-Wendan who remember what came before)
    ↓
Sanctuary Keepers (Those who maintain major turning-grounds)
    ↓
Process Workers (Specialists in particular types of transformation)
    ↓
The Recently Turned (New Rot-Wendan still learning their nature)
```

**No Hierarchy:**
Like the Tako, the Rot-Wendan don't have formal leadership. They coordinate through shared purpose—everyone understands what needs doing, and they do it. When decisions require collective input, the Old Ones are consulted, but they don't command.

## Key Figures

### The Mother of Compost

| Attribute | Value                                               |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Title** | The Mother of Compost (name lost)                   |
| **Role**  | Eldest known Rot-Wendan; keeper of the Great Barrow |
| **Age**   | Unknown; possibly centuries or millennia            |

**Character:** The Mother tends the Great Barrow—an ancient burial mound that predates the Empire, now a vast sanctuary of ongoing transformation. She may have been human once; she no longer remembers. She is the process she serves, as much fungal network as individual consciousness.

She's aware of the surface world's troubles in the way that soil becomes aware of weather: effects trickle down, changing what comes to her. The Passing disrupted the natural flow—too many dead at once, then too few as populations adjusted. Her work continues but the rhythms are wrong.

She can communicate with humans, though she finds the effort strange. They're so attached to their individual forms, so frightened by the transformation they'll eventually undergo.

**Goal:** To maintain the Turning, whatever surface events occur.

**Complication:** The Great Barrow has begun receiving wrong things—bodies that won't decompose properly, spiritual residue that resists processing, materials that feel touched by the abyss. Something is corrupting the inputs, and the Mother's sanctuary may become sick as a result.

### Sporebearer Mycos

| Attribute | Value                       |
| --------- | --------------------------- |
| **Title** | Walker Between Grounds      |
| **Role**  | Ambassador and investigator |
| **Age**   | 67 years since Turning      |

**Character:** Mycos was a farmer before he became. A fever took him in his compost heap; he woke as something new. Of all the Rot-Wendan, he best remembers what it was to be human. He maintains more individual identity than most, including a name.

He's become the Rot-Wendan's closest thing to an ambassador—the one most willing and able to communicate with the living. He finds humans fascinating still, though he struggles to explain his perspective in terms they understand. They think decay is an ending; he experiences it as the opposite.

He's been investigating the corruption the Mother detected. The wrong-things aren't random—they're connected to whatever disruption caused the Passing. He's trying to understand the pattern, but he's a farmer, not a scholar. He needs help from those who think in ways he doesn't.

**Goal:** To understand and address the corruption affecting Rot-Wendan sanctuaries.

**Complication:** Mycos is discovering that the corruption traces back to an ancient source—something sealed away long ago that the Passing has begun to release. The Rot-Wendan may be the first to feel its effects because they work with the matter it's contaminating.

### Soul-Sifter Silence

| Attribute | Value                                       |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Title** | Keeper of the Battlefield Grounds           |
| **Role**  | Processor of war-dead; spiritual specialist |
| **Age**   | 120+ years since Turning                    |

**Character:** Silence formed from a mass grave—hundreds of soldiers whose combined spiritual residue merged with the processes breaking them down. She (the pronoun is approximate) contains fragments of all those deaths, which gives her unusual perspective but also unusual burden.

She tends battlefields—the places where violent death leaves particularly potent residue. Since the Passing created so many, she's been overwhelmed. More bodies than she can process; more spiritual residue than can be properly sifted. She's backed up, and the backlog is causing problems above: restless dead, Reft emergence, places of concentrated wrong.

She's been reaching out to Ostaran practitioners for help. They work the other side of the death-boundary; perhaps together they can address what neither can alone.

**Goal:** To clear the spiritual backlog and restore proper death-flow.

**Complication:** Silence has absorbed so much violent death that it's starting to change her. She's becoming more aggressive, more present, more willing to take rather than wait for what comes. She may need to split—releasing some of what she's absorbed before she becomes something harmful.

# Part Three: Goals & Tensions

## Primary Goal

**Maintain the Turning**

The Rot-Wendan's purpose is the cycle—receiving death, processing it, releasing life. Their primary goal is simply continuing this work, whatever disruptions occur above.

## Secondary Goals

- **Address Corruption:** Cleanse the wrong-things contaminating their sanctuaries
- **Clear Backlog:** Process the spiritual residue the Passing left behind
- **Build Alliances:** Connect with those who might help with overwhelming work
- **Understand the Source:** Learn what's causing the corruption

## Internal Tensions

### Speed vs. Thoroughness
The backlog pressure encourages faster processing. But faster processing leaves residue; incomplete turning creates problems. Different Rot-Wendan have different tolerances for quality compromise.

### Isolation vs. Contact
Traditionally, the Rot-Wendan work unseen. Current circumstances may require visible emergence. Some embrace this; others resist.

### Individual vs. Collective
Most Rot-Wendan have minimal individual identity—they're more process than person. Those who maintain personality (like Mycos) sometimes conflict with those who don't understand why individuality matters.

## External Tensions

### Human Fear
Humans fear decay. Rot-Wendan appearances are deeply unsettling. Even well-intentioned contact produces horror responses.

### Church Hostility
The Church considers the Rot-Wendan abominations—unholy mockeries of proper death that should be destroyed. Scouring bands target visible sanctuaries.

### Ostaran Competition
Some Ostaran practitioners view the Rot-Wendan as rivals or threats, wrestling over spiritual territory. Others see potential partnership.

# Part Four: Assets & Resources

## Material Resources

| Resource                | Status              | Notes                              |
| ----------------------- | ------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Sanctuaries**         | Scattered, variable | Ancient and modern turning-grounds |
| **Processing Capacity** | Currently strained  | Backlog from Passing               |
| **Physical Forms**      | Resilient           | Hard to destroy permanently        |

## Capabilities

**Transformation Magic:** Working the border between death and life enables:
- Accelerated or controlled decay
- Spore-based communication
- Physical restructuring of organic matter
- Perception of spiritual residue

**Distributed Presence:** Many Rot-Wendan are networked—connected through mycelium or shared consciousness that spans significant areas.

## Knowledge Resources

**Death-to-Life Expertise:** No one understands transformation processes better.

**Historical Accumulation:** Sanctuaries contain memories of everything processed there—accessible through communion with the space.

**Corruption Detection:** They notice wrong-things before others because they try to process them.

# Part Five: Relationships

| Faction               | Relationship       | Notes                                     |
| --------------------- | ------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Ostaran Tradition** | Potential Alliance | Both work with death; different methods   |
| **Church Hierarchy**  | Hostile            | "Abominations" requiring destruction      |
| **Alysian Tradition** | Complicated        | Both serve the land; different approaches |
| **The Scouring**      | Lethal             | Target category                           |
| **Humans Generally**  | Feared             | "Rot people" is not a friendly category   |
| **Gastberend**        | Unknown            | Different underworld function             |

# Part Six: Adventure Hooks

## 1. The Corrupted Sanctuary

**Situation:** Mycos has identified a sanctuary—an ancient cemetery—where the corruption is actively spreading. Bodies buried there are rising wrong, not as Reft exactly but as something that looks like Rot-Wendan but isn't. He needs help investigating safety the contamination source.

**The Question:** What's corrupting the cemetery? How do you stop it? And what happens to the wrong-risings already created?

**Complications:**
- The cemetery is in Church-controlled territory; visible Rot-Wendan presence would be attacked
- The corruption may be intelligent or at least reactive
- Stopping the source might require entering something dangerous
- The wrong-risings aren't necessarily hostile, just wrong
- Other parties may have interests in the cemetery's contents

## 2. The Clearing

**Situation:** Soul-Sifter Silence needs help clearing her backlog—too much violent death for one entity to process. She's offering partnership to Ostaran practitioners or anyone else who can work the spiritual side while she works the physical.

**The Question:** Can the backlog be cleared before it causes more problems? What does "partnership" with a Rot-Wendan actually involve? And what happens when you process that much violent death?

**Complications:**
- Working with Silence means working with processes humans find horrifying
- Ostaran practitioners may not trust Rot-Wendan methods
- The backlog includes deaths that someone would rather keep unprocessed
- Clearing may attract attention from things that feed on such residue
- Silence herself may be changing in dangerous ways

## 3. The Becoming

**Situation:** Someone is deliberately creating new Rot-Wendan—trapping people in situations where they'll die into transformation. The result is confused, malformed beings that don't understand their purpose. Someone is engineering an army—or an experiment.

**The Question:** Who's creating forced-Rot-Wendan? Why? And what should be done with the confused beings already created?

**Complications:**
- The forced-made aren't evil, just traumatized and confused
- Whoever's doing this may have valid-seeming reasons
- The process corrupts natural becoming; created beings are wrong
- Stopping the creator doesn't address already-created beings
- Some may want forced-Rot-Wendan for their own purposes

## 4. The Mother's Warning

**Situation:** The Mother of Compost has emerged—for the first time in centuries, she's manifested a form humans can perceive and communicate with. She has a warning: the source of corruption is waking fully, and what's been contaminating sanctuaries is just the first trickle of something vast.

**The Question:** What is she warning about? How can humans understand the Mother's perspective? And is there anything that can be done about what's coming?

**Complications:**
- The Mother's consciousness is barely individual; communication is difficult
- Her warnings are in terms that don't translate easily
- What she's describing may be too large to address
- Her emergence has attracted attention she can't easily escape
- Acting on her warning may require alliances that seem impossible
