The Abgal-Tako are the cephalopod peoples of the deep—octopoid beings of remarkable intelligence who've accumulated knowledge across vast spans of time. They exist throughout the ocean depths, from shallow reefs to the edge of the abyss, observing, recording, and understanding.

They are not warlike. They are not traders. They are not colonizers. They are students. Their purpose—if purpose can be ascribed to beings so alien—is understanding. They observe the world, preserve what they learn, and occasionally intervene when accumulated wisdom suggests intervention changes outcomes they care about.

Surface dwellers rarely encounter them. The Ti-Abzu know they exist but find them frustrating—the Tako share knowledge reluctantly and their logic is difficult to follow. Since the Passing, however, the Tako have become unusually active. They've been leaving messages, approaching populations they usually ignore, and making requests they've never made before.

Something has their attention. Given what they know and what they've seen across millennia, that attention should concern everyone.

# Part One: Nature & Culture

## What the Abgal-Tako Are

The Tako are genuinely alien—not humanoid beings with different bodies, but completely different kinds of consciousness:

**Physical Nature:**
- Cephalopoid forms (octopus-like, with significant variation)
- Variable size (small as a cat to large as a whale, depending on lineage)
- Remarkable longevity (centuries; some may live millennia)
- Physical adaptability (pressure, temperature, camouflage)

**Mental Nature:**
- Distributed consciousness (thinking happens throughout body, not just brain)
- Non-linear information processing (patterns rather than sequences)
- Vast memory capacity (remember everything they experience)
- Different relationship to time (past and future feel less distinct to them)

**The Alien Mind:**
Tako don't think like humans or Ti-Abzu. Their understanding is pattern-based rather than narrative-based. They perceive connections that others miss but sometimes miss things others find obvious. Communication with them requires patience and tolerance for confusion.

## The Sunken Libraries

Tako knowledge is preserved in physical locations—structures throughout the ocean where information is encoded in ways only they can read:

| Library                 | Location       | Focus                                     |
| ----------------------- | -------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **The Coral Archive**   | Shallow waters | Recent history, surface observation       |
| **The Current Record**  | Mid-depths     | Ocean patterns, climate, ecology          |
| **The Deep Catalogue**  | Abyss-edge     | Ancient history, primordial knowledge     |
| **The Memorial Spiral** | Various        | Species records, extinction documentation |
| **The Living Library**  | Mobile         | Tako themselves carrying knowledge        |

## Cultural Values

| Value            | Expression                                           |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Observation**  | Watching without interfering unless necessary        |
| **Preservation** | Recording knowledge that might otherwise be lost     |
| **Connection**   | Finding patterns that link disparate phenomena       |
| **Patience**     | Operating on timescales others find incomprehensible |
| **Selectivity**  | Choosing carefully when and whether to act           |

# Part Two: Structure & Leadership

## Organization

Tako society—to the extent it can be called society—is organized around knowledge domains rather than territory or hierarchy:

```
The Elder Minds (Ancient Tako whose knowledge spans millennia)
    ↓
Domain Keepers (Specialists in particular areas of knowledge)
    ↓
Observers (Active information gatherers)
    ↓
Young Minds (Learning through experience)
```

**No Central Authority:**
The Tako have no ruler, no council, no formal decision-making body. They coordinate through shared understanding—when multiple Tako recognize the same patterns, they act in concert without needing to communicate. This appears mysterious to outsiders but feels natural to them.

## Key Figures

### The Eldest (Name Unknown)

| Attribute | Value                                     |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Title** | None; called "The Eldest" by younger Tako |
| **Role**  | Living repository of ancient knowledge    |
| **Age**   | Unknown; possibly prehistoric             |

**Character:** The Eldest is the oldest living Tako—how old, no one knows. It dwells in the deepest parts of the Deep Catalogue, rarely communicating even with other Tako. Its memories stretch back before human civilization, before the Empire, perhaps before the current arrangement of continents.

It's not a leader; leadership is a humanoid concept the Tako don't apply. But when the Eldest speaks, other Tako listen. It perceives patterns across timescales no one else can comprehend.

It has recently begun communicating more—sending fragments of information through the Tako networks, requesting specific observations, apparently concerned about something. What concerns a being that has survived everything the world has produced is itself cause for concern.

**Goal:** Unknown. The Eldest's intentions are opaque even to other Tako.

**Complication:** The Eldest may be dying. Tako can live for millennia, but nothing lives forever. Its recent activity might be preparation for knowledge transfer—or final warnings before it passes.

### Scholar-Arms Kalitha

| Attribute | Value                                 |
| --------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Title** | Keeper of Surface Observation         |
| **Role**  | Specialist in surface-world knowledge |
| **Age**   | 340                                   |

**Character:** Kalitha has spent centuries studying the surface world—particularly the Empire and its peoples. She's the Tako most knowledgeable about human politics, religion, and society. She finds humans fascinating: so brief, so urgent, so convinced that their tiny span matters enormously.

She's also genuinely fond of some surface species, in a way other Tako find eccentric. She advocates for surface contact not just because it's strategically useful but because she'd enjoy it. This emotional investment makes her unusual among her people.

She's been driving the recent outreach attempts—leaving messages for surface and Ti-Abzu contacts, requesting meetings at the Amber Wreck, trying to communicate warnings that her people find obvious but others struggle to understand.

**Goal:** To establish communication with surface powers capable of understanding Tako warnings and acting on them.

**Complication:** Kalitha's warnings are accurate but nearly incomprehensible. She perceives the threat in pattern-terms that don't translate into human language. Every attempt to explain produces confusion. She's running out of ways to make herself understood.

### Deep-Mind Cthonis

| Attribute | Value                                        |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Title** | Keeper of the Abyss-Edge                     |
| **Role**  | Specialist in the deep and what dwells there |
| **Age**   | 500+                                         |

**Character:** Cthonis dwells at the very edge of the abyss—the boundary between the known ocean and the depths where even Tako fear to go. His purpose is watching that boundary, recording what stirs in the darkness, understanding the patterns of the deep.

He's seen the threat building for decades. Long before the Passing, he observed changes in the abyss-currents, disappearances of usual creatures, movements of vast shapes in the darkness below. He's been warning the Tako networks; now those warnings are finally being heeded.

He's also damaged by his proximity to the abyss. Something down there affects minds, and even Tako resilience has limits. His communications are increasingly fragmented, filled with references that other Tako struggle to parse. He may be the most informed about the threat and the least able to communicate what he knows.

**Goal:** To convey understanding of the abyss-threat to those who might act on it.

**Complication:** Cthonis is losing coherence. His mind is fragmenting under strain—whether from the abyss's influence or his own age, he's not certain. His knowledge may die with him if he can't transfer it soon.

# Part Three: Goals & Tensions

## Primary Goal

**Communicate the Warning**

The Tako have seen something building in the abyss—something that threatens everything above. Their primary goal is making others understand this threat well enough to respond effectively.

## Secondary Goals

- **Preserve Knowledge:** Ensure that even if catastrophe comes, what's been learned survives
- **Build Alliances:** Connect parties that might otherwise act alone against the threat
- **Understand the Threat:** Continue observation and analysis of what's stirring
- **Protect the Libraries:** Ensure knowledge repositories survive whatever's coming

## Internal Tensions

### Intervention vs. Observation
Tako tradition favors watching over acting. But watching a catastrophe unfold without warning seems wrong. Different Tako have different views on how much active intervention is appropriate.

### Communication Barriers
Tako think in patterns; others think in narratives. Translation is imperfect at best. Urgency is hard to convey when your warnings sound like riddles.

### Risk Assessment
Some Tako believe the threat can be survived through retreat. Others believe nowhere is safe. The debate affects strategy.

## External Tensions

### Ti-Abzu Suspicion
The Ti-Abzu consider Tako frustratingly cryptic and possibly unreliable. Building trust requires patience the situation may not permit.

### Surface Ignorance
Surface dwellers barely know Tako exist. Establishing credibility from nothing is challenging.

### The Abyss Itself
Whatever's rising doesn't communicate, doesn't negotiate, doesn't respond to observation. It simply is.

# Part Four: Assets & Resources

## Material Resources

| Resource                  | Status   | Notes                             |
| ------------------------- | -------- | --------------------------------- |
| **Sunken Libraries**      | Intact   | Vast knowledge repositories       |
| **Ocean Access**          | Complete | Can reach anywhere in the seas    |
| **Physical Adaptability** | High     | Pressure, temperature, camouflage |

## Knowledge Resources

**Historical Record:** Tako memory stretches back beyond human history. They've witnessed previous ages, previous catastrophes, previous recoveries.

**Pattern Recognition:** Their mode of understanding finds connections others miss—useful for prediction and strategy.

**Deep Knowledge:** They know more about the abyss and its inhabitants than any surface or Ti-Abzu source.

## Limitations

**Numbers:** Tako are not numerous; there may be only a few thousand in all the world's oceans.

**Combat:** They are observers, not warriors. Physical confrontation is not their strength.

**Communication:** Translating Tako understanding into actionable intelligence is difficult.

# Part Five: Relationships

| Faction                 | Relationship     | Notes                                   |
| ----------------------- | ---------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Ti-Abzu**             | Complicated      | Theoretical allies; actually suspicious |
| **Surface Powers**      | Unknown          | Barely aware Tako exist                 |
| **House Marina**        | Point of Contact | Quintus Marinus receiving messages      |
| **Council of Captains** | Indirect         | Through Marina contact                  |
| **The Deep Threat**     | Observers        | Watching but cannot oppose              |

# Part Six: Adventure Hooks

## 1. The Amber Wreck Meeting

**Situation:** The Tako have requested a meeting at the Amber Wreck—a sunken ship they've declared sacred neutral ground. They've asked for "those who breathe both airs"—someone who can function in both surface and undersea environments. They have warnings to share.

**The Question:** What do the Tako want to communicate? Can their warnings be understood? And what do they expect in return for their knowledge?

**Complications:**
- Reaching the Amber Wreck requires diving to 60 feet for extended period
- Tako communication is confusing and pattern-based
- What they want to convey may be terrifying
- They may require something difficult in exchange
- Time pressure doesn't allow for prolonged translation efforts

## 2. The Fragmenting Mind

**Situation:** Deep-Mind Cthonis is losing coherence, but his knowledge of the abyss-threat may be essential. The Tako want someone to attempt retrieving information from him before he's gone entirely—but the process requires entering his deteriorating consciousness through deep-mind link.

**The Question:** Can Cthonis's knowledge be saved? What does "entering" a Tako mind even mean? And what happens if the abyss-taint that's breaking him touches the rescuers?

**Complications:**
- The deep-mind link is Tako technology; it may not work on non-Tako
- Cthonis's fragmentation means navigating chaos
- The abyss-influence might transfer to visitors
- Information retrieved may be incomprehensible
- Cthonis may not want to be saved—just to be heard

## 3. The Library Evacuation

**Situation:** Kalitha believes the Deep Catalogue—the library containing primordial knowledge—will be the first Tako installation to fall when the abyss-threat arrives. She wants to evacuate the most essential records before it's too late. But the Catalogue is at the abyss-edge, and something is already aware of the Tako's presence there.

**The Question:** Can the essential knowledge be saved? What's down there watching? And is the knowledge worth the risk?

**Complications:**
- The abyss-edge is lethal for non-Tako (and barely survivable for Tako)
- What constitutes "essential knowledge" is debatable
- Something at the Catalogue is hostile and possibly intelligent
- Rescue mission might draw attention to other Tako installations
- Some Tako believe the Catalogue should be defended, not abandoned

## 4. The Translation Problem

**Situation:** The Tako have been sending warnings for months, but no one can understand them. The messages are patterns—shapes, colors, relationships—that don't translate into language. Someone needs to develop a translation method before the warnings become obsolete.

**The Question:** How do you translate thought-patterns into words? Is it even possible? And what happens when you finally understand what they've been trying to say?

**Complications:**
- Human and Tako cognition are fundamentally different
- Partial translation may be worse than none (misunderstanding is dangerous)
- The process of translation may change the translator
- Time is running out for the warnings to matter
- Understanding doesn't guarantee ability to act
