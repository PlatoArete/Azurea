The Ti-Abzu are the humanoid peoples of the middle depths—the waters between the sunlit shallows and the crushing abyss. They've built civilizations beneath the waves for millennia, with cultures as complex and varied as anything on the surface. To surface dwellers who know of them at all, they're "merfolk" or "sea people," half-understood legends from sailor stories.

The Ti-Abzu are connected to Atargatis, the Depths Sister, though their relationship with her is more complex than the surface's relationship with Bronwyn. They don't worship her exactly; they live within her realm, acknowledge her presence, and navigate her currents both literal and metaphorical.

Since the Passing, the Ti-Abzu have become more active in surface affairs. Something is wrong in the deep—something that threatens their cities and may eventually threaten the surface world as well. For the first time in generations, they're reaching out beyond their waters.

# Part One: Nature & Culture

## What the Ti-Abzu Are

The Ti-Abzu are their own people, adapted to the undersea environment in ways surface dwellers find alien:

**Physical Nature:**
- Humanoid forms with aquatic adaptations (gills, scales, fins)
- Significant physical variation between communities
- Comfortable at depths of 50-500 feet; surface and abyss both problematic
- Lifespans roughly equivalent to humans (70-90 years typical)

**Social Nature:**
- Organized into City-States with distinct cultures
- Trade networks connecting communities across coastal waters
- Oral traditions preserved across generations
- Artistic expression through sculpture, song, and current-dance

**The Diversity:**
Ti-Abzu communities have developed differently based on their environments. Warm-water peoples differ from cold-water peoples. Deep-city cultures differ from shallow-city cultures. There is no single "Ti-Abzu way"—only the diversity of the depths.

## Major City-States

| City                  | Depth               | Character                       | Status    |
| --------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------- | --------- |
| **Coralheim**         | 200 feet            | Largest city; diplomatic center | Stable    |
| **The Kelp Towers**   | 150 feet            | Agricultural, peaceful          | Thriving  |
| **Obsidian Reach**    | 400 feet            | Deep-access, mysterious         | Concerned |
| **Pearl Garden**      | 100 feet            | Trading post, surface contact   | Active    |
| **The Cold Currents** | 300 feet (northern) | Isolationist, traditional       | Wary      |

## Cultural Values

| Value        | Expression                                                      |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Flow**     | Adapting to circumstances rather than fighting currents         |
| **Depth**    | Respecting what lies beneath; never forgetting the abyss exists |
| **Song**     | Communication through complex vocalizations                     |
| **Exchange** | Trading goods, knowledge, and culture between cities            |
| **Memory**   | Preserving history through oral tradition                       |

# Part Two: Structure & Leadership

## Organization

Ti-Abzu society is organized through City-States, each governed by councils of senior citizens:

```
The Tidal Council (Representatives from major cities)
    ↓
City Councils (Governing body of each city)
    ↓
Guild Assemblies (Professional organizations)
    ↓
Household Groups (Extended family units)
```

**The Tidal Council:**
When inter-city matters require coordination, the Tidal Council convenes—representatives from major cities meeting to address shared concerns. This body has been meeting more frequently since the Passing.

## Current Leadership

| Position           | Name                   | Notes                                       |
| ------------------ | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Voice of Coralheim | Elder Pelagius         | Senior diplomat; surface contact specialist |
| Keeper of Currents | Song-Mistress Thalassa | Communication networks                      |
| Deep Warden        | Admiral Benthis        | Military defense; abyss-watcher             |
| Trade Master       | Merchant Nereus        | Economic coordination                       |
| Memory Keeper      | Ancient Poseta         | Historical knowledge; crisis context        |

## Key Figures

### Elder Pelagius (Voice of Coralheim)

| Attribute | Value                                           |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Title** | Voice of Coralheim, Speaker to the Surface      |
| **Role**  | Primary Ti-Abzu representative to surface world |
| **Age**   | 78                                              |

**Character:** Pelagius has spent his long life learning about the surface world—trading with coastal communities, observing human politics, developing the contacts that might someday prove essential. He believed that day would come eventually. The Passing proved him right.

He's the closest thing the Ti-Abzu have to a surface expert. He understands something of human politics, commerce, and religion. He knows which ports might be receptive and which would attack his people on sight. This knowledge makes him invaluable as the cities reach out.

He's also old, tired, and frightened. What's stirring in the deep is worse than he wants to admit. His attempts to warn surface contacts have mostly failed—they don't believe in "sea monsters." He's running out of time to make them understand.

**Goal:** To establish surface alliances before whatever's rising from the abyss reaches the upper waters.

**Complication:** Pelagius's surface contacts are fragmented by the Passing's chaos. The merchants he knew are scattered. The port authorities have changed. He's rebuilding a network that took decades to establish, with perhaps months to get it functioning.

### Admiral Benthis (Deep Warden)

| Attribute | Value                                        |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Title** | Deep Warden of the Tidal Council             |
| **Role**  | Military commander; abyss-threat coordinator |
| **Age**   | 52                                           |

**Character:** Benthis commands the Ti-Abzu's military forces—such as they are. Her people are not warriors by inclination; they've survived through adaptation and avoidance rather than confrontation. But something in the deep doesn't care about avoidance.

She's been building defenses at the cities' lower boundaries, organizing patrols into the mid-depths, and training citizens for combat none of them expected to face. It's not enough. The forces gathering in the abyss are beyond anything her people can resist alone.

She's the one who authorized contact with the surface. Not because she trusts surface dwellers—she doesn't—but because the alternative is watching her cities die. If the surface world can be convinced to help, perhaps together they can face what's coming. Perhaps.

**Goal:** To build sufficient defensive capability to survive whatever emerges from the deep.

**Complication:** Benthis has authorized reconnaissance missions to the abyss-edge. Two have failed to return. The third returned with one survivor—driven mad, speaking of vast shapes and consuming darkness. She's suppressing the reports to prevent panic, but she can't suppress what she's learned.

### Merchant Nereus (Trade Master)

| Attribute | Value                                  |
| --------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Title** | Trade Master of the Tidal Council      |
| **Role**  | Economic coordinator; surface commerce |
| **Age**   | 41                                     |

**Character:** Nereus manages the Ti-Abzu's trading networks—the movement of goods between cities and the limited commerce with surface communities. He's younger than most Council members, more comfortable with change, more willing to take risks.

He sees opportunity in the surface crisis. Human trade routes are disrupted; Ti-Abzu routes are not. Human coastal communities need goods they can't produce; Ti-Abzu can provide some of them. If his people can position themselves as essential trading partners, they gain leverage for the alliances they need.

He's been establishing new surface contacts—specifically, approaching Quintus Marinus of House Marina, who's proved unusually receptive to underwater communication. The relationship is promising, if still fragile.

**Goal:** To build economic relationships with surface powers that create mutual dependence and facilitate military alliance.

**Complication:** Nereus's surface trade initiatives are being sabotaged. Shipments are being intercepted; couriers are disappearing. Someone doesn't want the Ti-Abzu forging surface alliances. He suspects the Abgal-Tako, but he's not certain.

# Part Three: Goals & Tensions

## Primary Goal

**Survival Against the Rising Threat**

Something is stirring in the abyss below Ti-Abzu territory. The cities' scouts report vast movements in the depths, disturbances in the ancient currents, and the disappearance of creatures that should be there. The Ti-Abzu need allies against whatever's coming.

## Secondary Goals

- **Surface Alliance:** Establish relationships with surface powers who can help
- **Intelligence:** Understand what's happening in the deep before it reaches the cities
- **Unity:** Coordinate the scattered city-states for collective defense
- **Trade:** Build economic ties that make alliance valuable for surface partners

## Internal Tensions

### Isolation vs. Contact
Some Ti-Abzu believe surface contact is dangerous—that exposing their existence invites exploitation or attack. Others believe isolation means facing the abyss-threat alone.

### City Rivalries
The city-states have their own interests and rivalries. Coralheim's leadership isn't universally accepted. Cold Currents barely participates in Tidal Council deliberations.

### Information Control
How much should ordinary Ti-Abzu know about the threat? Leaders debate whether full disclosure would mobilize resistance or cause panic.

## External Tensions

### Human Ignorance
Most surface dwellers don't believe Ti-Abzu exist, or consider them dangerous monsters. Overcoming this requires careful contact.

### The Abgal-Tako
The cephalopod peoples have their own agendas. They may be allies, rivals, or something more complicated. Their silence is concerning.

### The Deep Threat
Whatever's rising from the abyss is the fundamental problem. All other concerns are secondary to survival.

# Part Four: Assets & Resources

## Material Resources

| Resource                | Status      | Notes                                        |
| ----------------------- | ----------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **City Infrastructure** | Intact      | Coral cities with sophisticated construction |
| **Trade Goods**         | Valuable    | Pearls, coral, rare fish, salvage            |
| **Agricultural Base**   | Sustainable | Kelp farms, fish herdings                    |
| **Salvage Rights**      | Contested   | Sunken ship claims                           |

## Military Resources

| Force            | Size           | Notes                           |
| ---------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------- |
| City Guards      | ~2,000 total   | Defense-focused, lightly armed  |
| Patrol Flotillas | 12 groups      | Reconnaissance and escort       |
| Deep Scouts      | 50 individuals | Specialized abyss-border patrol |

**Limitations:** The Ti-Abzu are not martial people. Their forces are adequate for city defense and piracy prevention, but not for the kind of threat emerging from the deep.

## Unique Capabilities

**Depth-Field Affinity:** Connection to Atargatis provides:
- Water manipulation (currents, pressure)
- Deep-sight (perceiving through darkness)
- Communication at distance through water
- Healing specifically effective in aquatic environments

# Part Five: Relationships

| Faction                 | Relationship          | Notes                                                |
| ----------------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Surface Powers**      | Seeking Contact       | Limited existing relationships                       |
| **House Marina**        | Tentative Partnership | Quintus Marinus receptive                            |
| **Shiranui Consortium** | Unknown               | Eastern peoples may have their own undersea contacts |
| **Abgal-Tako**          | Complicated           | Theoretical allies; actually uncertain               |
| **Church Hierarchy**    | Unknown/Hostile       | Would likely consider them monsters                  |
| **The Deep Threat**     | Enemies               | Whatever's rising must be stopped                    |

# Part Six: Adventure Hooks

## 1. The Emissary's Mission

**Situation:** Elder Pelagius is sending an official embassy to the surface—the first in living memory. He needs surface allies to facilitate the meeting, translate concerns, and prevent violent misunderstandings. The stakes are literally civilizational.

**The Question:** Can the embassy succeed? What would an alliance between surface and undersea actually look like? And how do you convince people that "sea monsters" want to help?

**Complications:**
- The embassy is vulnerable to attack from those who fear the unknown
- Church doctrine offers no framework for peaceful undersea contact
- The Ti-Abzu's needs may conflict with surface interests
- Cultural misunderstandings could derail negotiations
- Time pressure from the rising threat limits patience

## 2. The Sabotage Investigation

**Situation:** Nereus's surface trade initiatives are being sabotaged. He suspects the Abgal-Tako but isn't certain. He needs surface agents to investigate—people who can move where Ti-Abzu cannot, asking questions his people can't ask.

**The Question:** Who's sabotaging the trade? Why? And does solving this mystery reveal something worse?

**Complications:**
- The saboteur might be Abgal-Tako, surface powers, or something unexpected
- Investigation requires moving between worlds (surface/undersea)
- The truth might complicate rather than solve the problem
- Nereus's suspicions might be wrong—or right for the wrong reasons
- The sabotage might be connected to the deep threat

## 3. The Deep Reconnaissance

**Situation:** Admiral Benthis needs intelligence from the abyss-edge—information about what's gathering there. Previous scouts have died or gone mad. She's willing to provide support and reward for surface allies willing to attempt what her people cannot.

**The Question:** What's in the deep? Can useful intelligence be gathered? And what happens when you see something that shouldn't be seen?

**Complications:**
- The abyss-edge is genuinely lethal—pressure, cold, and worse
- Ti-Abzu support has limits; surface allies operate alone beyond certain depths
- The things in the deep may notice investigation
- Intelligence gathered may be incomprehensible or overwhelming
- Returning with knowledge doesn't mean ability to act on it

## 4. The Disappeared City

**Situation:** Communication with Obsidian Reach—the deepest Ti-Abzu city—has ceased. The city hasn't sent representatives to Council meetings. Trade ships find the city apparently abandoned. The Tidal Council needs to know what happened.

**The Question:** What happened to Obsidian Reach? Are there survivors? And is this the first attack of whatever's rising?

**Complications:**
- Obsidian Reach is near the abyss-edge; reaching it is dangerous
- The city may be destroyed, abandoned, or occupied by something hostile
- Survivors might have fled to deeper or shallower waters
- What destroyed the city (if destroyed) might still be present
- The answer might reveal the deep threat's full nature
