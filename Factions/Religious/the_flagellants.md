The Flagellants are a penitential movement within the Solarian Church—bands of believers who believe that physical self-punishment can atone for sin and appease divine wrath. They walk the roads in procession, whipping themselves until blood flows, praying for the salvation the Passing proved humanity needs desperately.

They are not officially sanctioned by the Church. They are not officially condemned either. The Hierarchy finds them embarrassing—their public spectacles of suffering make the Church look fanatical—but also useful, channeling genuine religious fervor that might otherwise become unpredictable.

Since the Passing, the Flagellants have grown dramatically. When catastrophe suggests divine punishment, self-punishment seems logical response. Their processions attract thousands of participants and millions more witnesses. What they carry with them—physically and spiritually—has become a question no one wants to answer.

# Part One: The Movement

## Origins & Theology

The Flagellants draw on ancient traditions of penitential practice—the idea that suffering voluntarily endured can substitute for punishment divinely deserved. The logic is simple:
- Humanity has sinned
- Sin requires punishment
- The Passing was punishment imposed
- Further self-punishment might satisfy divine anger
- Enough suffering might prevent another Passing

This theology is not sophisticated. It's visceral, emotional, and deeply compelling to people traumatized by catastrophe and seeking meaning in their suffering.

## The Processions

Flagellant movements travel in processions: groups of a dozen to several hundred walking the roads between towns, stopping in public spaces to demonstrate their practice:

**A Typical Procession:**
1. Arrival announced by hymns and bells
2. Gathering in central square or market
3. Sermon on sin, punishment, and penance
4. Public self-flagellation (participants beat themselves with whips)
5. Invitation for onlookers to join or confess
6. Collection of alms
7. Movement to next destination

**The Procession Cycle:**
Major processions follow routes that take weeks or months to complete, visiting dozens of communities. They grow and shrink as participants join or leave.

## The Blood Question

Since the Passing, something has changed in Flagellant practice. The blood they spill feeds something. Not deliberately—most Flagellants have no idea what they're doing—but the collective suffering, the focused pain, the ritualized bleeding creates resonance with the Blood Field.

Some processions now demonstrate effects that shouldn't be possible:
- Wounds that heal faster than natural
- Pain that produces ecstasy rather than agony
- Shared experience across groups in trance
- Occasional manifestations witnesses struggle to describe

The Blood Field is feeding on the movement. The movement is drawing power from the Blood Field. Neither fully understands the other.

# Part Two: Structure & Leadership

## Organization

Flagellant processions are led by charismatic individuals but lack formal hierarchy:

```
The Prophet/Prophetess (Procession leader; claims divine guidance)
    ↓
The Scarred (Experienced members, marked by their practice)
    ↓
The Seeker (Regular participants)
    ↓
The Called (Those joining temporarily)
    ↓
The Witnesses (Following without participating)
```

**No Central Authority:**
Each procession operates independently. There's no coordinating body, no official doctrine, no mechanism for controlling what the movement does. Attempts to create such structures have failed.

## Key Figures

### Brother Torment (Marcus the Wounded)

| Attribute | Value                                   |
| --------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Title** | Prophet of the Bleeding Procession      |
| **Role**  | Leader of the largest mobile procession |
| **Age**   | 41                                      |

**Character:** Marcus was a minor Church official before the Passing—a bookkeeper in a provincial diocese. He lost his family during the catastrophe. His response was not grief but transformation: he began walking, began preaching, began beating himself until the pain drowned everything else.

Something answered. The Blood Field touched him first of the new Flagellants, and he became its primary conduit into the movement. His wounds no longer close naturally—they remain open, seeping, demonstrating his ongoing sacrifice. His pain has become ecstasy. He doesn't understand what's happened to him, only that God has chosen him for special suffering.

He leads the Bleeding Procession—several hundred members who travel the Heartland, drawing crowds wherever they stop. His sermons are powerful, his presence terrifying, his effect on believers transformative. He genuinely believes he's doing God's work.

**Goal:** To spread the practice of penitential suffering until enough payment has been made to appease divine anger.

**Complication:** Marcus is losing himself to the Blood Field. The thing that answers his pain is not God, but he can't perceive the difference. His ecstatic states are becoming longer, his human personality thinner. Eventually there may be more Field than man.

### Sister Merciful (Helena Tears)

| Attribute | Value                             |
| --------- | --------------------------------- |
| **Title** | Mother of the Weeping Route       |
| **Role**  | Leader of second major procession |
| **Age**   | 35                                |

**Character:** Helena leads a different kind of Flagellant movement—one focused on tears rather than blood, on grief rather than pain. Her followers weep for the dead, for the suffering, for the sins that brought punishment. They practice self-denial rather than self-harm.

She founded the Weeping Route after watching the Blood-focused movements and finding them disturbing. Something about Brother Torment's procession felt wrong—she couldn't articulate what, but she knew she needed an alternative. Her movement attracts those who want penitence without violence.

She's deeply suspicious of the mainstream Flagellant movement and has been investigating what's happening to groups like the Bleeding Procession. What she's discovering is terrifying: the Blood Field is real, it's feeding on the movement, and the movement's leaders are becoming something other than human.

**Goal:** To offer genuine penitential practice while protecting participants from whatever is corrupting the violent movements.

**Complication:** Helena's Weeping Route is being infiltrated. Some who join bring Blood Field influence with them—survivors of other processions who've been touched. She's trying to identify and help them before they transform her movement into what she was trying to escape.

# Part Three: Goals & Tensions

## Primary Goal

**Appease Divine Wrath**

The Flagellants believe they're paying humanity's debt through suffering. Their primary goal is generating enough penitential payment to satisfy divine anger and prevent further catastrophe.

## Secondary Goals

- **Spread the Practice:** Recruit more participants to increase payment
- **Demonstrate Devotion:** Show God (and humanity) the depth of commitment
- **Experience Transcendence:** The suffering brings states many find meaningful
- **Community:** The processions provide belonging for displaced and traumatized people

## Internal Tensions

### Blood vs. Tears
Different Flagellant traditions emphasize different practices. Blood-focused movements are growing powerful but disturbing. Grief-focused movements are smaller but may be safer.

### Independence vs. Coordination
Each procession operates alone. Some want unified movement; others resist any structure that might limit divine guidance.

### Transformation Questions
Some Flagellants are clearly changing—wounds that don't close, pain that becomes pleasure, boundaries of self dissolving. Is this divine blessing or something else?

## External Tensions

### Church Ambivalence
The Hierarchy officially disapproves but practically tolerates. The movement channels fervor that might become dangerous if suppressed.

### Blood Field Corruption
The movement as a whole is being corrupted by Blood Field influence. Most members don't know this; leadership may not either.

### Scouring Connection
Some Flagellant processions have merged with Scouring bands—self-punishment combined with other-punishment. This hybrid is particularly dangerous.

# Part Four: Adventure Hooks

## 1. The Corrupted Procession

**Situation:** The Bleeding Procession is approaching a major city. Its leader, Brother Torment, seems to be something more (or less) than human now. Cardinal Valens's reformist network wants someone to infiltrate the procession and determine exactly what's happening—whether it can be stopped, whether the participants can be saved.

**The Question:** What has Brother Torment become? Can the procession's direction be changed? And what happens when hundreds of Blood Field-touched people enter a city?

**Complications:**
- Infiltrating requires participation in disturbing practices
- The procession members are victims as much as threats
- Brother Torment may still have enough humanity to reach
- The Blood Field itself may notice investigation
- The city's population might welcome the procession

## 2. The Weeping Route's Defense

**Situation:** Sister Merciful suspects her movement is being infiltrated by Blood Field influence. She needs help identifying the carriers and developing methods to protect or heal them. But the investigation requires understanding a kind of contamination that may spread through contact.

**The Question:** Can infiltrators be identified safely? Can they be saved? And how do you protect a movement of grief from becoming one of blood?

**Complications:**
- The carriers may not know they're contaminated
- Investigation risks the investigators
- Expelling carriers doesn't solve where they go next
- The Blood Field may be adapting to resistance
- Some infiltration may be deliberate rather than accidental
