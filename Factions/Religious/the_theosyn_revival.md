| Attribute           | Value                                                                                    |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Type**            | Religious                                                                                |
| **Status**          | Emerging                                                                                 |
| **Scope**           | Imperial (Underground)                                                                   |
| **Primary Base**    | Decentralized; concentrated at old shrine sites                                          |
| **Symbol/Heraldry** | Varies by deity; the movement as a whole uses the North-Facing Door (the "Devil's Door") |

The Theosyn are the old gods—the divine powers worshipped throughout the Empire before the Solarian Church consolidated its monopoly. The Church didn't destroy them; it absorbed them, converting gods into saints and incorporating their festivals into the liturgical calendar. For centuries, they slept beneath their borrowed names, their true natures forgotten.

Since the Passing, they're waking up.

Shrines abandoned for centuries are receiving visitors. Names that haven't been spoken aloud in generations are being whispered again. The "saints" are remembering who they were—and some are angry about what was done to them. The Theosyn Revival is not a movement with leaders and plans; it's a phenomenon of divine awakening that different people are responding to in different ways.

# Part One: The Nature of the Theosyn

## What They Are

The Theosyn are genuine divine beings—not as powerful as the Seven Sisters who created the world, but far more than mortal. They emerged in the early ages, some born from the Sisters' power, some arising from human belief, some whose origins even they don't remember. They ruled as gods before the Church systematically conquered the spiritual landscape.

**Their Condition:**
- They exist partially in their realm of origin, partially in the belief that sustains them
- When worshipped, they're stronger; when forgotten, they fade
- The Church's conversion didn't kill them—it put them in something like sleep
- The Passing disrupted whatever magic maintained that sleep

**The Awakening Process:**
Most Theosyn are not fully awake. They're dreaming—reaching out through visions, responding to prayers at their old sites, influencing those sensitive to their presence. Full awakening requires renewed worship: congregations, rituals, offerings. Each active worshipper strengthens them.

## Categories of Theosyn

| Type              | Nature                                              | Examples                                                             |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **The Converted** | Gods made into saints; their identities stolen      | "Saint Brennius" (god of healing), "Saint Vinalia" (goddess of wine) |
| **The Hidden**    | Gods who went underground, maintaining secret cults | The Horned Lord, the Well Mother                                     |
| **The Forgotten** | Gods whose names were erased entirely               | Nameless presences at certain sites                                  |
| **The Hostile**   | Gods who refuse forgiveness for what was done       | The names are not spoken                                             |

## The Angylion

The most significant awakened Theosyn is the Angylion—the god the Church knows as the Archangel. He was a war-god, a protector, a champion who led other gods against threats. The Church made him commander of the heavenly host, subordinate to their God.

He's remembered his true name. He's not subordinate to anyone.

The Angylion has begun speaking to those who call on the Archangel—but what he says contradicts Church teaching. He's gathering followers who serve him rather than the Church's version of him. He represents both the possibility of Theosyn-Church reconciliation and the threat of divine civil war.

# Part Two: The Movement

## Structure (or Lack Thereof)

The Theosyn Revival has no organization. It's thousands of individual responses to divine awakening:
- Old people remembering prayers their grandparents taught them
- Priests discovering their "saint" responds differently now
- Villagers finding that offerings at the old stones work when Church prayers don't
- Scholars realizing the historical implications of what's happening
- Opportunists claiming divine mandate for their own purposes

**Informal Networks:**
Some coordination exists through:
- Traveling practitioners sharing information
- Academics connecting historical dots
- Reformist clergy facilitating (with their own agenda)
- The gods themselves, communicating through dreams and signs

## Key Figures

There are no leaders, but certain individuals have become significant:

### Völva Yrsa Moonwhisper

*See Fjordlands Development for additional context*

The seeress of Fjordhavn who first identified the awakening pattern. She's documented fourteen distinct Theosyn reasserting themselves in northern territories. Her writings are circulated among those seeking understanding.

### Father Brennius of Confluencia

*See Rivervales Development*

A Church priest who discovered his patron "Saint Brennius" was actually a pre-Church healing god. Instead of reporting this heresy, he's been experimenting with the old prayers—and finding they work better than the new ones. He's become a node for others having similar experiences.

### The Nameless Keeper

Someone (no one knows their identity) maintains a shrine in the mountains where seven Theosyn are openly worshipped together. Pilgrims are finding their way there through dreams. The Inquisition has tried twice to locate it; both expeditions failed.

### Lady Mira Argentum

A noblewoman in Lexium who funds Academic research into Theosyn history. She claims scholarly interest, but she's actually receiving visions from a forgotten goddess of silver and moonlight. She's using her wealth to protect those the Inquisition targets.

# Part Three: Goals & Tensions

## The Theosyn Want Different Things

This isn't a unified faction. Different awakening gods have different attitudes:

| Attitude      | Gods                               | Approach                                         |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Forgiving** | Many local deities, nature spirits | Willing to coexist, want worship restored        |
| **Pragmatic** | The Angylion, war-gods             | Interested in power arrangements, not grievances |
| **Wounded**   | Fertility gods, home spirits       | Hurt by centuries of neglect, need healing       |
| **Hostile**   | Certain betrayed gods              | Want revenge; the Church burned their followers  |

## The Movement's Tensions

### Integration vs. Opposition
Should the revival work within Church structures (convincing reformists to acknowledge Theosyn) or against them (building competing worship)?

### Secrecy vs. Openness
Should practitioners hide to survive, or proclaim openly to strengthen the gods through visible worship?

### Authenticity vs. Innovation
Should recovered worship replicate ancient practices exactly, or adapt to modern understanding?

### Individual vs. Collective
Are the Theosyn separate beings requiring separate cults, or aspects of divine reality that can be worshipped together?

## External Tensions

### The Church
The Hierarchy considers Theosyn revival absolute heresy. The Scouring burns practitioners. Even reformists like Cardinal Valens advocate dialogue rather than acceptance.

### Realm-Field Implications
If the Theosyn are real gods, what does that mean for Church claims about the nature of divinity? Theological implications threatening to everyone.

### Political Exploitation
Various powers want to use Theosyn revival for their own purposes—northern independence, provincial autonomy, anti-Church resistance. The gods may not appreciate being used.

# Part Four: Assets & Resources

## Material Resources

| Resource                 | Status      | Notes                                      |
| ------------------------ | ----------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Shrine Sites**         | Recovered   | Hundreds of old sites being reconsecrated  |
| **Liturgical Knowledge** | Fragmentary | Pieced together from folk memory and texts |
| **Offerings/Donations**  | Growing     | Grateful worshippers contribute            |
| **Real Property**        | None        | Movement is mobile and hidden              |

## Divine Resources

The movement's primary assets are the gods themselves:
- **Answering Prayers:** Theosyn requests work when Light-field prayers fail
- **Dreams and Visions:** The gods guide their worshippers directly
- **Minor Miracles:** Healings, blessings, protections that demonstrate divine reality
- **Protection:** Some gods actively shield their followers from harm

## Knowledge Resources

**Academic Networks:** Scholars documenting the revival, identifying Theosyn identities, reconstructing practices.

**Folk Memory:** Communities remembering traditions that never fully died. Grandmothers who know the old songs.

**Church Archives:** Ironically, the best records of Theosyn worship are in Church documents describing what they suppressed. Reformist allies provide access.

# Part Five: Relationships

| Faction               | Relationship | Notes                                          |
| --------------------- | ------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Church Hierarchy**  | Hostile      | Heresy requiring elimination                   |
| **Reformist Faction** | Complex      | Some dialogue; fundamental disagreements       |
| **The Scouring**      | Lethal       | Primary targets for purification               |
| **Folk Traditions**   | Allied       | Often overlap; Theosyn support local practices |
| **Northern Jarls**    | Sympathetic  | Traditional religion aligns with Theosyn       |
| **Academics**         | Supportive   | Scholarly interest, some personal involvement  |
| **Inquisition**       | Targeted     | High-priority investigation                    |

# Part Six: Adventure Hooks

## 1. The Devil's Door

**Situation:** A church in the rural Midlands has unsealed its north-facing door—the entrance traditionally used by the unbaptized, sealed by Church decree centuries ago. The local priest claims divine guidance. Theosyn worshippers are visiting. The Inquisition is mobilizing.

**The Question:** What does unsealing the door actually do? Is the priest genuinely receiving divine guidance? Can the congregation be protected from the Inquisition?

**Complications:**
- The door opens into something unexpected
- The priest's guidance may come from a Theosyn pretending to be a saint
- The village is divided between old and new faith
- The Inquisition force includes a genuinely devout investigator who might be reached
- Other churches are watching to see what happens

## 2. The Naming

**Situation:** One of the Forgotten—a Theosyn whose name was completely erased—is trying to recover their identity. They're sending dreams to scholars, guiding them toward scattered references that might reconstruct the lost name. But another force is actively destroying the evidence.

**The Question:** Can the Forgotten's name be recovered? Who's trying to prevent it? And what happens when a god remembers who they are?

**Complications:**
- The evidence is scattered across multiple archives (some Church-controlled)
- The opposing force might be the Inquisition, another Theosyn, or something stranger
- The Forgotten can offer gifts to those who help—but divine gifts have costs
- Naming a god grants power over them, which interested parties want
- The Forgotten might not be benevolent once they remember

## 3. The Angylion's Choice

**Situation:** The Angylion is offering an alliance. He'll support human communities against Reft and other threats if they acknowledge him as he truly is—not the Archangel, but the ancient war-god. Some communities want to accept. The Church considers this absolute betrayal.

**The Question:** Should the alliance be accepted? What does acknowledgment actually require? And what are the Angylion's real goals?

**Complications:**
- The Angylion's protection is real and valuable
- Acceptance means open break with the Church
- The Angylion's theology differs from Church teaching in specific, important ways
- Other Theosyn are watching to see how this plays out
- The Hierarchy might launch military action against accepting communities

## 4. The Hostile One

**Situation:** Not all awakening Theosyn are willing to forgive. One whose name is carefully not spoken—whose followers were particularly brutally suppressed—is demanding vengeance. They're offering power to those who'll burn churches as churches burned their temples.

**The Question:** Can the Hostile One be calmed? Contained? Or must they be opposed? And how do you fight a god?

**Complications:**
- The Hostile One has legitimate grievances
- Some followers are genuine believers; others are just anti-Church opportunists
- Other Theosyn disapprove but won't directly intervene
- The Church's response might create more grievances, strengthening the Hostile One
- There might be a way to offer justice without violence—if anyone knows what that looks like
