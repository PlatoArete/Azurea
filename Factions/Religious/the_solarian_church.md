The Solarian Church, also known as the Church of the Covenant of Light, is the dominant religious institution of the Empire. For centuries, it maintained a monopoly on legitimate spiritual practice, suppressing older traditions and claiming exclusive access to divine truth. The Passing shattered its authority: the Light failed to protect, the clergy could not explain why, and the Supreme Pontiff emerged mad from the Founder's Tomb.

The Church has not collapsed—institutions this large don't die quickly—but it has fractured. Multiple factions now compete for control of what remains, each offering different explanations for what went wrong and different visions for what comes next. The unity that once made the Church powerful is now a carefully maintained fiction.

# Part One: Leadership & Hierarchy

## Official Structure

The Church presents itself as a unified hierarchy with the Luminary at its apex. The reality is more complex.

**The Formal Chain:**

| Level     | Title                             | Function                                      |
| --------- | --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Supreme   | The Luminary (Pontifex Lucis)     | God's voice on earth; currently incapacitated |
| High      | Conclave of Flames (12 Cardinals) | Elect Luminary, advise on doctrine            |
| Regional  | Archprelates                      | Administer provinces                          |
| Urban     | Prelates                          | Lead city congregations                       |
| Parochial | Kindlers                          | Serve parish communities                      |
| Entry     | Acolytes                          | Junior clergy in training                     |

**Specialized Orders:**

| Order                                 | Function                    | Current Status             |
| ------------------------------------- | --------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Office of Sacred Purity (Inquisition) | Heresy investigation        | Increasingly independent   |
| Order of Hospitallers                 | Healing and care            | Overwhelmed but functional |
| Monastic Orders (various)             | Contemplation, preservation | Withdrawn from conflicts   |
| Mendicant Friars                      | Traveling ministry          | Many joined Flagellants    |

## The Current Reality

Power resides not with the Luminary but with the Conclave of Flames. The Conclave is divided (see The Church Hierarchy faction document), but it collectively manages:
- Doctrinal pronouncements (forged in Aldric VII's name)
- Episcopal appointments
- Treasury allocations
- Relations with secular powers

Below the Conclave, the hierarchy functions unevenly. Some dioceses maintain pre-Passing structures. Others have effectively collapsed, with individual priests operating independently. The Inquisition has become a semi-autonomous power. The Scouring acts entirely without authorization.

# Part Two: The Fractures

## Sub-Faction: The Scouring

**Type:** Militant Movement
**Scope:** Empire-wide (concentrated in rural areas)
**Leadership:** Decentralized; tacit support from Cardinal Draconis

### Character

The Scouring began as spontaneous violence during the Passing—mobs attacking "witches" and "heretics" they blamed for the catastrophe. The Church might have suppressed it. Instead, Orthodox clerics offered theological legitimation: the Passing was punishment for tolerance of evil. The cure was purification through fire.

Now the Scouring is a movement of perhaps five thousand active militants organized into local bands that identify, accuse, and execute "heretics." Their definition of heresy is expansive: non-humans, folk practitioners, healers who use "suspicious" methods, anyone who questions Church doctrine, anyone who defends the accused.

**Methods:**
- Public trials (no defense permitted)
- Burning at the stake (preferred)
- Property confiscation (distributed to "the faithful," meaning themselves)
- Marking survivors (branding, scarification)

**Relationship to Church:** Officially, the Scouring has no Church sanction. Practically, Orthodox clerics provide sanctuary, theological instruction, and intelligence about targets. The Inquisition occasionally coordinates with Scouring bands. Cardinal Draconis defends them in Conclave as "expressions of righteous anger."

### The Tension

The Scouring threatens the Church's legitimacy even as it claims to defend it. Every innocent burned undermines moral authority. Every atrocity alienates potential faithful. But confronting the Scouring would split the Church—the Orthodox faction would resist, possibly schisming.

---

## Sub-Faction: The Flagellants

**Type:** Penitent Movement
**Scope:** Empire-wide (wandering)
**Leadership:** None formal; charismatic individuals attract followers

### Character

When the Passing came, some sought redemption through pain. They believed humanity's sins had invited catastrophe, and only extreme penance could earn forgiveness. They whip themselves in public processions, fast until they collapse, endure exposure and privation that kills many. They believe suffering brings them closer to God.

Something else is happening. The Flagellants have accidentally discovered the Blood Field—an emergent realm fed by suffering that rewards pain with power. Those who persist in self-torture sometimes develop abilities: healing that comes from shared agony, strength that flows from open wounds, visions that arrive with blood loss.

They interpret these gifts as divine reward. They are not.

**Methods:**
- Public processions with self-flagellation
- Communal confession and shared penance
- "Taking on" others' sins through voluntary suffering
- The Weeping (extreme penitents who find relief through tears)

**Relationship to Church:** The Hierarchy considers Flagellants distasteful but tolerable—they're technically orthodox and provide spectacle that reinforces faith themes. What the Hierarchy doesn't know is that prolonged Blood Field exposure changes practitioners. Some Flagellants have become something other than purely human.

### The Secret

Some Flagellants who weep find peace not from God but from Katiari—the forgotten sister who is Hope, who dwells in the Abyss. Her realm touches those in absolute despair. Her gift is release. The Weeping who find her are the only Flagellants actually being healed—but they don't know who's healing them.

---

## Sub-Faction: The Monastics

**Type:** Contemplative Orders
**Scope:** Hidden (scattered monasteries)
**Leadership:** Individual abbots/abbesses; loose coordination

### Character

When the Church fragmented, some clergy chose withdrawal. The monastic orders—communities dedicated to prayer, contemplation, and preservation—retreated to their isolated houses and sealed the doors. They continue their ancient work: copying manuscripts, maintaining gardens, praying the hours, and quietly preserving knowledge the Church might prefer forgotten.

The Monastics are not reformers. They don't seek to change the Church. They seek to survive the changes and preserve what matters until someday—maybe generations from now—it can be restored.

**Methods:**
- Scriptoriums copying essential texts
- Libraries preserving pre-Church traditions
- Hospitals continuing care (some Hospitaller orders)
- Schools teaching the capable (regardless of doctrine)

**Relationship to Church:** Officially, monasteries remain under diocesan authority. Practically, they've become independent. The Hierarchy lacks resources to enforce control over remote communities. The Inquisition occasionally investigates, but monastery libraries contain documents that could embarrass powerful people—a form of protection.

### The Collections

Monastic libraries contain texts the Church officially suppresses:
- Theosyn liturgies from before conversion to "saints"
- Realm-field theories that contradict doctrine
- Historical records that don't match official narratives
- Translated works from Shiranui and Tyrlóng

These are preserved, not published. The Monastics believe knowledge survives better in hidden form than in confrontation with power. Someday it will be needed. They're making sure it exists when that day comes.

## Sub-Faction: The Academics

**Type:** Intellectual Movement
**Scope:** Urban (concentrated in Lexium)
**Leadership:** Informal; University of Lexium provides shelter

### Character

Not all questioning minds left the Church. Some remained to study it—to understand why doctrine fails to match reality, where the theological errors lie, what actually happened during the Passing. These are the Academics: clergy who became scholars, scholars who became skeptics, skeptics who haven't quite become heretics.

Many shelter in Lexium, where the University's ancient charter provides protection from Church prosecution. They teach approved subjects publicly and pursue forbidden questions privately. Their network extends throughout the Heartland—sympathetic clergy who share concerns, forward documents, and receive visitors.

**Methods:**
- Textual criticism of sacred documents
- Historical analysis of Church claims
- Investigation of realm-field mechanics
- Comparative study of suppressed traditions

**Relationship to Church:** The Hierarchy knows the Academics exist and considers them a manageable problem—intellectuals whose theories will never reach common people. The Inquisition disagrees; Grand Adjudicator Noctis has made "University heresy" a priority. Several Academics have been arrested. This has only driven the movement further underground and made it more careful.

### The Library of Questions

A secret collection maintained by the Academic network contains:
- Documented contradictions in Church teaching
- Evidence that "saints" are Theosyn under different names
- Analysis suggesting Light-field weakening began before the Passing
- Theories about what Aldric VII might have found in the Founder's Tomb

Copies exist in multiple locations. Destroying one library wouldn't eliminate the collection. The Academics learned from watching what happens to centralized information.

## The Parish Clergy

**Type:** Local Ministry
**Scope:** Empire-wide
**Leadership:** None collective; individual priests answer to bishops (in theory)

### Character

The heroic face of the Church is the Kindler—the parish priest who stayed when bishops fled, who organized defenses against Reft, who buried the dead when the Sending rites stopped working, who comforts the grieving without answers to offer. These are the clergy who matter to ordinary people.

Parish priests have become practically independent. Communications with diocesan authorities are unreliable. Pronouncements from Vandgwyn arrive late or not at all. Local needs demand immediate response. So the Kindlers improvise: adapting liturgies when Light-field magic fails, incorporating folk practices their parishioners know work, quietly working with anyone who can help regardless of theological approval.

Some have been denounced to the Inquisition for these adaptations. The accusers usually find themselves unwelcome in communities that remember who stayed and helped.

**Methods:**
- Whatever works
- Practical pastoral care
- Creative interpretation of doctrine
- Community organization for survival

**Relationship to Church:** Parish clergy remain technically loyal to the hierarchy while practically ignoring it. They use official forms, pray for the Luminary, and acknowledge episcopal authority—when representatives appear. Between those rare occasions, they do what their communities need.

### The Reality

Parish ministry is where the Church is actually being reformed—not through high-level theological debate but through thousands of individual priests making millions of small decisions. Practices suppressed for generations are returning because they help people. Folk blessings are incorporated into formal liturgies. The distinction between approved and forbidden is becoming whoever can actually make things happen.

By the time the Hierarchy notices, the reformation will be complete.

# Part Three: Goals & Tensions

## Primary Goal

**Spiritual Monopoly Maintenance**

Despite fragmentation, all Church factions share one goal: maintaining the Church's position as the sole legitimate religious authority. They disagree violently on methods, but none wants other traditions to achieve equal status. The Theosyn revival, folk practice resurgence, and Revnan persistence all threaten their shared foundation.

## Secondary Goals

- **Explain the Passing:** The Church needs a coherent theological account of why catastrophe came and what it means
- **Restore Light-field Access:** Clerical magic has weakened; restoring it would prove divine favor
- **Suppress Alternatives:** Other traditions' growth must be slowed while internal fractures are addressed
- **Maintain Revenue:** Tithe collection has declined; financial stability requires renewed faith

## Internal Tensions

### Who Inherits the Church?
The Conclave's three factions each believe the others are destroying what they're trying to save. Institutionalists see Reformists as heretics and Orthodox as zealots. Reformists see both others as obstacles to necessary change. Orthodox see everyone else as insufficiently pure.

### Independent Power Centers
The Inquisition operates semi-autonomously. The Scouring acknowledges no authority. Monasteries have sealed their doors. Parish clergy improvise. The centralized Church of doctrine is already fragmenting into practical autonomy.

### The Blood Field Corruption
Flagellants and certain Inquisitors are being claimed by the Blood Field. This emergent realm rewards suffering with power—and eventually claims its practitioners. The Church doesn't understand what's happening. When they do, the response may shatter remaining unity.

## External Tensions

### The Theosyn Awakening
Old gods are remembering their names. Shrines receive visitors. The Angylion—the god the Church calls the Archangel—has spoken, and what he says contradicts Church teaching. If the Theosyn fully return, the Church's claim to exclusive truth collapses.

### Folk Practice Resurgence
Suppressed for centuries, traditions carried in family practice and festival custom are reasserting openly. Light-field magic fails where folk blessings succeed. The Alysian tradition—veneration of the land and seasons—never actually died, merely hid. Now it's shedding its disguise.

### Secular Resistance
Aurheim's Regency Council refuses Church temporal authority. Provincial lords ignore Vandgwyn's pronouncements. The Church risks becoming irrelevant to actual governance while claiming ultimate authority over it.

# Part Four: Assets & Resources

## Material Resources

| Resource                | Status        | Notes                                   |
| ----------------------- | ------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Central Treasury**    | Substantial   | Centuries of accumulation               |
| **Local Treasuries**    | Depleted      | Taken for survival needs                |
| **Church Buildings**    | Extensive     | Thousands across Empire; many abandoned |
| **Sacred Relics**       | Priceless     | Many are Theosyn artifacts              |
| **Art and Manuscripts** | Irreplaceable | Archives, libraries, scriptoriums       |

## Institutional Power

**The Sacraments:** Control of baptism, marriage, confession, and last rites gives the Church power over life's key transitions.

**Education:** Church schools trained most literate people. This creates loyalty (sometimes) and shared culture.

**Charity:** Church organizations feed the poor, heal the sick, shelter travelers. This creates dependency and gratitude.

## Knowledge & Secrets

**Theosyn Identities:** Church records document which "saints" are converted pagan gods—knowledge that would reshape religious understanding.

**Realm-Field Theory:** Academic texts contain more accurate accounts of how magic actually works than the Church publicly teaches.

**The Founder's Tomb:** Whatever Aldric VII found remains unknown—but finding it would answer fundamental questions about what the Church actually is.

# Part Five: Relationships

| Faction             | Relationship  | Notes                                           |
| ------------------- | ------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Theosyn Revival** | Hostile       | Old gods threaten exclusive claims              |
| **Folk Traditions** | Persecutory   | Labeled witchcraft; actually effective          |
| **Regency Council** | Tense         | Competing authority claims                      |
| **Goleuwyr**        | Persecutory   | "Soulless" doctrine (ironic given Light origin) |
| **Urkhani**         | Hostile       | Considered literally demonic                    |
| **Axis Faith**      | Tolerated     | Dwarven tradition given marginal respect        |
| **Trading Houses**  | Transactional | Need each other; don't trust each other         |

# Part Six: Adventure Hooks

## 1. The Devil's Door

**Situation:** An old church in the Midlands has unsealed its north-facing door—the "Devil's Door" locked for centuries. The local priest claims the Theosyn guided him to do so. Now the church attracts visitors seeking the old ways. The Inquisition is coming.

**The Question:** Is this genuine Theosyn contact or dangerous heresy? Can the priest and his congregation be protected? What actually happens when the Devil's Door opens?

**Complications:**
- The Inquisition will burn the priest without hesitation
- The Theosyn presence is real but doesn't speak clearly
- The community depends on both Church charity and the new spiritual energies
- There's something behind the door—something waiting

## 2. The Flagellant Miracle

**Situation:** A Flagellant procession passed through a village suffering from a Reft infestation. After their departure, the Reft were gone—dissolved, destroyed, cleansed. The Flagellants claim divine miracle. The village wants to join them. The Church wants to understand what happened.

**The Question:** Was this Light-field intervention, Blood Field manifestation, or something else entirely? And what happens to those who follow the miracle-workers?

**Complications:**
- The Flagellants' leader shows Blood Field symptoms
- The village's Reft weren't destroyed—they were absorbed
- Inquisition agents are also investigating
- The miracle-workers are heading toward Vandgwyn

## 3. The Stolen Relic

**Situation:** The Finger of Solwyn—supposedly the Founder's actual finger bone—has been stolen from the Cathedral of First Light. This shouldn't be possible; the security was absolute. The Conclave needs quiet recovery before word spreads.

**The Question:** Who stole the relic? How? And what do they plan to do with it?

**Complications:**
- Multiple factions had motive: Reformists (proving it's not actually Solwyn's), Orthodox (using it to prove doctrine), Theosyn revivalists (testing its nature)
- The theft may have been inside work
- The relic may not be what the Church claims
- Whoever has it may be trying to wake Solwyn—or something else
