The Monastics are the contemplative orders of the Solarian Church—monks and nuns who've withdrawn from ordinary life to pursue prayer, study, and preservation of knowledge. They dwell in monasteries scattered across the Empire: some perched on cliffs, some buried in forests, some hidden in cities, all devoted to maintaining what might otherwise be lost.

They are the Church's memory. While bishops politick and the Scouring burns, the monasteries copy manuscripts, maintain libraries, preserve techniques and traditions that no one else thinks to protect. They're not flashy. They're not powerful. They're simply there, generation after generation, quietly keeping the light alive.

Since the Passing disrupted everything, the Monastics have become more important than ever. When trade routes break and communication fails, the monasteries become islands of preserved knowledge. When skills are lost because practitioners died, the manuscripts remember how things were done.

# Part One: The Orders

## Structure of Monastic Life

Monasteries operate according to Rules—detailed guides for daily life developed by founding saints or reformers. Most monasteries follow one of the major Rules:

| Order              | Rule Focus            | Character                           |
| ------------------ | --------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Solarites**      | Prayer and Liturgy    | Maintaining the worship cycle       |
| **Preservites**    | Copying and Libraries | Saving knowledge                    |
| **Hospitalers**    | Care and Healing      | Tending the sick and traveler       |
| **Contemplatives** | Mystical Practice     | Seeking direct divine experience    |
| **Laborites**      | Work and Production   | Farming, crafting, self-sufficiency |

**A Typical Monastery:**
- 20-100 members (most are smaller)
- Led by an abbot/abbess who holds authority under the Rule
- Daily schedule organized around prayer offices (matins, lauds, vespers, etc.)
- Work between prayers (copying, farming, healing, depending on order)
- Limited contact with outside world

## The Great Monasteries

Several monasteries have achieved particular prominence:

| Monastery            | Location     | Specialty               | Status                 |
| -------------------- | ------------ | ----------------------- | ---------------------- |
| **Lucidum Sanctum**  | Near Aurheim | Primary library         | Stable                 |
| **Calamus Abbey**    | Midlands     | Manuscript production   | Thriving               |
| **Hospitium Montis** | High Marches | Traveler care           | Essential post-Passing |
| **Silentium**        | South        | Contemplative practice  | Mysterious             |
| **Laborium Prime**   | Grainmarch   | Agricultural techniques | Expanding influence    |

# Part Two: Structure & Leadership

## Organization

Monasteries are individually governed but connected through Orders:

```
Order Generals (Heads of entire Orders)
    ↓
Provincial Superiors (Regional coordinators)
    ↓
Abbots/Abbesses (Individual monastery leaders)
    ↓
Priors (Assistant leaders)
    ↓
Senior Members (Experienced monastics)
    ↓
Full Members (Professed monastics)
    ↓
Novices (Those in training)
```

**Autonomy:**
Despite this structure, individual monasteries have significant autonomy. The abbot's authority is nearly absolute within the walls. Order oversight is light.

## Key Figures

### Abbess Margarethe of Calamus

| Attribute | Value                               |
| --------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Title** | Abbess of Calamus Abbey             |
| **Role**  | Leader of premier manuscript center |
| **Age**   | 58                                  |

**Character:** Margarethe has led Calamus Abbey for fifteen years—transforming it from a secondary copying house into the Empire's most productive manuscript workshop. Under her leadership, the Abbey has developed improved copying techniques, trained scribes who work throughout the Church, and accumulated a library that rivals Lucidum Sanctum.

She's fiercely protective of her community and its mission. The Passing convinced her that knowledge preservation is more urgent than ever; she's been copying texts at increased pace, focusing on practical knowledge (medicine, agriculture, construction) rather than theology alone.

She's quietly radical. She doesn't believe the Hierarchy understands what's important. She's been preserving texts the Church has proscribed—not agreeing with them, just ensuring they survive. When the current crisis passes, someone will need to rebuild. They'll need everything.

**Goal:** To preserve all knowledge worth preserving, regardless of current politics.

**Complication:** Margarethe has been approached by Academics faction members who want access to her restricted collection. The texts include things that could destabilize current Church positions. She's weighing whether to share them.

### Abbot Silas of Hospitium Montis

| Attribute | Value                                         |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Title** | Abbot of Hospitium Montis                     |
| **Role**  | Leader of major healing/hospitality monastery |
| **Age**   | 67                                            |

**Character:** Hospitium Montis has always taken in travelers—the mountain monastery sits astride a major route, offering shelter and care to those crossing the passes. Since the Passing, this role has expanded dramatically. Refugees flood the passes; the monastery is overwhelmed.

Silas has opened his doors wider than his Rule technically permits. He's taken in too many, shared resources until they're strained, and pushed his community to exhaustion. He believes this is what the Light demands—that refusing help to preserve the monastery would betray their purpose.

His community is divided. Some agree with his expansion; others believe he's destroying what they have. He's trying to find balance while people die at his gates.

**Goal:** To help as many as possible without destroying the community that enables help.

**Complication:** Among the refugees are people carrying sickness—both physical disease and spiritual contamination. The Passing left traces on some survivors. Silas is trying to help everyone, but some are helping spread problems.

### Mother Quieta of Silentium

| Attribute | Value                                   |
| --------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Title** | Prioress of Silentium                   |
| **Role**  | Leader of contemplative monastery       |
| **Age**   | Unknown (appears 40; may be much older) |

**Character:** Silentium is the strangest of the great monasteries—a community devoted to silence, contemplation, and mystical practice that has produced seers, visionaries, and people who experience the Light-field directly. Mother Quieta leads this community.

She rarely speaks. When she does, people pay attention. What she says tends to be accurate—predictions, insights into people's souls, warnings about dangers. She's not infallible, but she's right often enough to be taken seriously.

She's been seeing something since the Passing—visions she hasn't shared publicly. The Light-field is damaged, that's known. But she's seen what damaged it, and she's seen what's gathering to exploit that damage. She's been preparing her community for conflict they don't know is coming.

**Goal:** To prepare for what she's seen approaching while maintaining her community's spiritual discipline.

**Complication:** Quieta's visions show multiple possible futures. Sharing them might influence which future arrives—but silence might allow the worst possibilities to manifest. She's uncertain whether speaking changes destiny or reveals it.

# Part Three: Goals & Tensions

## Primary Goal

**Preserve Knowledge**

The Monastics' essential purpose is preservation—keeping texts, traditions, techniques, and understanding that might otherwise be lost. Everything else serves this purpose.

## Secondary Goals

- **Maintain Worship:** Keep the prayer cycle going regardless of external chaos
- **Provide Sanctuary:** Offer refuge to those who need it
- **Train Successors:** Ensure the next generation can continue the work
- **Support the Church:** Serve broader Church needs while maintaining autonomy

## Internal Tensions

### Engagement vs. Withdrawal
Should monasteries engage with the world's problems (like Hospitium Montis) or withdraw to focus on preservation (like Calamus)? Different communities have different answers.

### Obedience vs. Conscience
The Hierarchy sometimes demands things monastics find wrong. When obedience conflicts with conscience, what takes precedence?

### Open vs. Restricted
Some knowledge is dangerous. Should monasteries share everything, or restrict access to certain texts and techniques?

## External Tensions

### Hierarchy Pressure
Bishops want monastic resources—manuscripts, laborers, wealth accumulated over generations. Monasteries resist.

### Scouring Demands
The Scouring wants monasteries to surrender "heretical" texts for burning. Some monastics refuse.

### Post-Passing Needs
Everyone wants what monasteries have: knowledge, food, shelter, healing. The demands exceed capacity.

# Part Four: Adventure Hooks

## 1. The Restricted Collection

**Situation:** Abbess Margarethe has texts the Academics want—proscribed manuscripts that might contain crucial information for understanding the Passing. She needs help deciding whether to share them, and if so, with whom. Retrieving some texts may require entering parts of the Abbey that haven't been opened in decades.

**The Question:** What's in the restricted collection? Should it be shared? And what happens when dangerous knowledge circulates?

**Complications:**
- Some texts are proscribed for reasons
- The Academics may have agendas beyond pure research
- The Abbey has rules about who enters restricted areas
- Church authorities would punish sharing
- The texts may contain information no one expected

## 2. The Contaminated Refuge

**Situation:** Hospitium Montis is suffering. Something's wrong with some of the refugees—sickness physical and spiritual spreading through the community. Abbot Silas needs help identifying the source and stopping the contamination without abandoning his hospitality mission.

**The Question:** What's contaminating the monastery? Can it be stopped without turning away the desperate? And what happens if the monastery falls?

**Complications:**
- Closing doors means people die outside
- The contamination may be hard to identify
- Some community members want to seal themselves away
- The route the monastery serves needs to remain open
- The contamination source may be sympathetic rather than hostile

## 3. The Vision's Warning

**Situation:** Mother Quieta has decided to share what she's seen—but not publicly. She's summoned trusted outsiders to Silentium to receive her warning and act on it. The journey alone is challenging; what she reveals may be worse.

**The Question:** What has Quieta seen? Can her visions be acted upon? And how do you prepare for a future that may change if you prepare?

**Complications:**
- Silentium is remote and hard to reach
- Quieta's communication style is difficult
- The visions may be symbolic rather than literal
- Acting on warnings changes what she's seen
- Others may want to prevent the message from spreading
