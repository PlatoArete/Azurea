| Attribute           | Value                                                                                             |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Type**            | Religious (Militant)                                                                              |
| **Status**          | Active                                                                                            |

| **Primary Base**    | Decentralized; strongest in Heartland and West                                                    |
| **Symbol/Heraldry** | A burning torch crossed with a sword — often crudely painted on buildings marked for purification |

The Scouring is a militant movement that emerged during the chaos of the Passing, when terrified mobs turned on "witches" and "heretics" they blamed for the catastrophe. What began as spontaneous violence has become an organized network of purification bands, united by theology that frames the Passing as divine punishment for tolerating evil.

They are not the Church, though they claim to serve it. They are not soldiers, though they wage war. They are the desperate faithful, given permission to act on fears they've always harbored, burning their way toward a purity that will never satisfy.

# Part One: Leadership & Hierarchy

## Structure

The Scouring has no central command—and this is both its weakness and its strength. Each local band operates independently, following charismatic leaders who claim divine inspiration. There is no hierarchy to decapitate, no headquarters to seize, no chain of command to corrupt.

**Organizational Pattern:**

```
Local Band (10-100 members)
    ↓ Led by
"Torch-Bearer" (Charismatic leader)
    ↓ Advised by
"Witness" (Usually a sympathetic priest or former seminarian)
    ↓ Supported by
"The Faithful" (Active participants in purifications)
    ↓ Protected by
"The Vigilant" (Community members who provide intelligence and shelter)
```

**Coordination:**
Bands don't formally coordinate, but they share:
- Theological justifications (spread by traveling Witnesses)
- Target identification methods (lists of "known heretics")
- Operational techniques (how to conduct trials, how to burn efficiently)
- Mutual recognition signs (torch-and-sword gestures)

## Current Leadership

There is no supreme leader. The closest figures to movement-wide influence are:

| Figure                      | Role                   | Notes                                                      |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Cardinal Marcus Draconis    | Theological Patron     | Provides legitimacy; doesn't direct operations             |
| Father Ignatius Pyre        | Traveling Preacher     | Most influential voice; wrote "The Flame's Mandate"        |
| Sister Severina the Scarred | Legendary Torch-Bearer | Founded the largest active band; considered a living saint |
| The Hooded Council          | Unknown                | Rumored coordinating body; may not exist                   |

## Power Dynamics

The movement's decentralized nature creates internal competition. Bands vie for status through body counts, dramatic trials, and discovered "nests" of heresy. More extreme actions generate more prestige.

**Escalation Pressure:** Each band tries to outdo the others. What began as targeting obvious outsiders (folk practitioners, non-humans) has expanded to include anyone accused by anyone, for any reason. Denunciation has become a weapon for settling personal scores.

**The Orthodox Connection:** Cardinal Draconis and his Orthodox faction provide theological cover but not operational control. They can legitimize or delegitimize specific actions after the fact, but they can't prevent bands from acting. This creates plausible deniability for the Church while ensuring the violence continues.

# Part Two: Key Figures

## 1. Father Ignatius Pyre

| Attribute | Value                                                   |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Title** | None official; called "Voice of the Flame" by followers |
| **Role**  | Traveling preacher, theological architect               |
| **Age**   | 45                                                      |

### Character

Ignatius was a seminary professor before the Passing—a scholar of Church history with particular interest in the early persecution of the Revnan tradition. When the catastrophe came, his academic knowledge became practical: he understood how purification movements had worked historically. He wrote "The Flame's Mandate," a theological justification for violence that has become the Scouring's founding text.

He doesn't lead a band himself. He travels constantly, preaching to crowds, blessing new Torch-Bearers, and adjusting theology to accommodate new categories of heresy. His words have killed thousands—but he's never personally harmed anyone. He considers himself a teacher, not a murderer.

He's brilliant, charismatic, and genuinely believes what he teaches. The Passing was punishment. Purification is the cure. Every heretic burned brings humanity closer to redemption. He's not a hypocrite—he would accept burning himself if convinced of his own heresy. This sincerity makes him far more dangerous than a cynical manipulator.

**Appearance:** Thin, intense, with eyes that burn when he speaks. He wears simple traveling robes and carries only a staff and the "Flame's Mandate" manuscript. His voice can fill a plaza or drop to intimate whisper.

**Mannerisms:**
- Quotes scripture constantly (often creatively interpreted)
- Refers to violence as "healing" or "cleansing"
- Weeps openly when describing humanity's sins
- Never raises his own hand against anyone

### Goal

To complete the purification that will restore God's favor and prevent another Passing. He believes this requires burning away every trace of heresy, every practitioner of false faiths, every contamination of pure doctrine.

**Immediate objectives:**
- Expand the movement into regions not yet reached
- Develop theological justifications for new target categories
- Establish the Scouring as the Church's true militant arm
- Witness the final purification that restores the Light

### Complication

Ignatius is dying. A wasting disease has given him perhaps a year—maybe less. He's accelerating his work, traveling more frantically, preaching with greater urgency. He wants to see the purification completed before he dies.

This desperation is making him careless. His latest sermons have implied that the Hierarchy itself may be contaminated, that even cardinals might need purification. Cardinal Theron has taken notice. The Inquisition—officially opposed to the Scouring but actually unclear on which side to take—is watching.

If Ignatius dies, the movement might fragment. Or it might venerate him as a martyr and become even more radical.

## 2. Sister Severina the Scarred

| Attribute | Value                              |
| --------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Title** | Torch-Bearer of the Heartland Band |
| **Role**  | Field commander, movement icon     |
| **Age**   | 38                                 |

### Character

Severina was a minor noblewoman who lost everything during the Passing—family, estates, faith in a God who would allow such suffering. She wandered in despair until she found the early Scouring and discovered purpose in its flames.

She's not a theologian. She doesn't understand the doctrinal subtleties Ignatius writes about. She understands fire: how it cleanses, how it transforms, how it reveals truth through suffering. She's personally overseen more than three hundred burnings. She remembers every face.

The scars covering half her face came from her first purification—the heretic fought back, knocked over the pyre, and Severina was caught in the flames. She didn't retreat. She held the heretic down until the fire consumed them both. Someone pulled her out. She doesn't know who.

She's terrifying: not because she's cruel (she takes no pleasure in the work) but because she's utterly certain. There is no argument that can reach her, no plea that can move her, no evidence that can shake her conviction. She is the purification's human form.

**Appearance:** Half her face is smooth scar tissue; the other half was once beautiful. She wears practical clothes for traveling and fighting. Her hands are calloused from work she does herself.

**Mannerisms:**
- Speaks quietly, almost gently
- Touches her scars unconsciously when stressed
- Prays before, during, and after every purification
- Treats condemned heretics with disturbing kindness

### Goal

To complete God's work. She doesn't think about what comes after purification is finished—she can't imagine that world. Her identity is the work. Without it, she's nothing.

**Immediate objectives:**
- Expand her band's territory into new regions
- Train successor Torch-Bearers
- Locate and eliminate the "great nests" of heresy
- Die in God's service when the work is done

### Complication

Severina has begun to doubt. Not the righteousness of purification—that remains certain—but her own state. The pleasure she's begun to feel during burnings disturbs her. The visions she's started having (fire that speaks, faces that aren't human) concern her.

She's experiencing Blood Field contamination. The suffering she witnesses and inflicts is feeding something, and that something is feeding her. She doesn't understand this theologically. She thinks she's being tested, or blessed, or perhaps damned. She's not sure which.

A trusted subordinate has noticed her changing and secretly contacted Cardinal Valens's reformist network. If the reformists can reach Severina before she's lost completely, they might turn the movement's most feared leader into its most effective critic. If they fail, she may become something far worse than a Torch-Bearer.

## 3. Brother Marcus Ashfall

| Attribute | Value                                      |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Title** | Witness to the Southern Band               |
| **Role**  | Theological advisor, target identification |
| **Age**   | 29                                         |

### Character

Marcus was an acolyte at a rural church when the Passing came. His priest died; his congregation died; he survived by hiding in the cellar with the communion wine. When he emerged, he was broken in ways he couldn't articulate.

He found the Scouring and discovered that identifying heretics gave him power. Not physical power—the power of decision. Life or death. Guilt or innocence. By pointing his finger, he could become the most important person in any village.

He's learned to read people: their fears, their secrets, their hidden resentments. He identifies heretics not through evidence but through social dynamics—who is unpopular, who has property others want, who threatened someone's interests. His accusations are always believed because they always align with what listeners want to believe.

He's also a coward. He never attends the actual purifications. He doesn't watch people burn. He just identifies them and moves on. He tells himself this makes him innocent of the deaths.

**Appearance:** Young, soft-faced, with an easy smile. He dresses as a humble clergyman. His eyes are constantly moving, watching, evaluating.

**Mannerisms:**
- Speaks in sympathetic, understanding tones
- Never accuses directly—suggests, implies, wonders aloud
- Collects secrets like currency
- Disappears before violence begins

### Goal

Power and survival. He doesn't believe the theology; he believes power. The Scouring gives him both, and he'll ride it as long as possible.

**Immediate objectives:**
- Maintain his position as essential advisor
- Accumulate blackmail material on band leadership
- Avoid personal danger while ensuring others face consequences
- Prepare exit strategies if the movement collapses

### Complication

Marcus has been selling information to the Inquisition. Not to oppose the Scouring—to ensure he's valuable to whoever wins. Grand Adjudicator Noctis knows everything he's reported.

What he doesn't know is that Noctis is tracking him not as an asset but as a target. His cynical manipulation of faith is exactly the kind of corruption she despises. When she's ready, his information will become evidence of his crimes. He'll burn alongside the heretics he identified.

# Part Three: Goals & Tensions

## Primary Goal

**Purification of the Empire**

The Scouring seeks to eliminate all heresy, all deviation from pure doctrine, all contamination that invited divine punishment. This is understood as a great work that will, when completed, restore God's favor and prevent future catastrophe.

The practical impossibility of complete purification is not acknowledged. Each burning is a step toward a goal that recedes with every step.

## Secondary Goals

- **Legitimization:** Official Church recognition of the Scouring as a religious order
- **Expansion:** Spread into regions not yet touched (the North, the Golden Coast)
- **Institutionalization:** Transform from movement to permanent structure
- **Escalation:** Extend purification to new categories (different faiths, different peoples, eventually Church reformists)

## Internal Tensions

### Control vs. Chaos
Some Torch-Bearers want structure—formal hierarchy, coordinated operations, official recognition. Others resist any control that might limit their divine mandate. This tension prevents effective organization while also preventing effective opposition.

### Theological Drift
Without central authority, doctrine mutates. Some bands have developed ideas Ignatius never taught—Blood Field theology, ancestor burning, prophetic visions. The movement may fracture into incompatible variations.

### Targeting Disputes
Who counts as a heretic? The original targets (folk practitioners, non-humans) are largely eliminated in some areas. Bands now turn on each other's insufficient purity, or find heresy in anyone who questions them.

## External Tensions

### Church Ambivalence
The Hierarchy officially opposes the Scouring but refuses to condemn it strongly. The Orthodox faction actively supports it. This creates confusion about the movement's legitimacy.

### Secular Opposition
The Regency Council considers the Scouring a threat to order. Local lords lose valuable subjects to the flames. Armed resistance has occurred. The movement may face military suppression—which would create martyrs.

### Reform Opposition
Cardinal Valens's reformist network actively works to undermine the Scouring, sheltering targets, exposing fraudulent accusations, and attempting to turn movement members. This creates potential for internal division.

# Part Four: Assets & Resources

## Material Resources

| Resource          | Status     | Notes                                               |
| ----------------- | ---------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Funds**         | Variable   | Donations and confiscated property                  |
| **Weapons**       | Improvised | Torches, farm tools, some seized military equipment |
| **Supplies**      | Local      | Bands live off communities they "protect"           |
| **Real Property** | None       | Movement is mobile by design                        |

## Institutional Power

**Community Networks:** The "Vigilant"—community members who provide intelligence, shelter, and support—exist in most rural areas. This creates an early warning system and supply network.

**Fear:** The Scouring's greatest asset is terror. Communities comply because resistance means being targeted. Denunciation is used to settle scores. Everyone is potentially an informant.

## Military Capability

| Force           | Size    | Notes                                  |
| --------------- | ------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Active Movement | ~5,000  | Across dozens of bands                 |
| Armed Core      | ~1,500  | Fighters trained for confrontation     |
| Support Network | ~20,000 | Vigilant members who provide logistics |

**Combat Assessment:** Individually, Scouring bands are no match for professional soldiers. Collectively, they're nearly impossible to eliminate—defeat one band, and three others continue. Guerrilla capability is high.

## Knowledge & Secrets

**Denunciation Archives:** Bands maintain lists of individuals who've been accused but not yet processed. These lists are both operational tools and blackmail material.

**Hidden Patrons:** Some noble families secretly support the Scouring to eliminate rivals. These connections are carefully protected.

**Blood Field Knowledge:** Some bands have stumbled into Blood Field practices without understanding what they're doing. This knowledge spreads through shared techniques.

# Part Five: Relationships

| Faction                | Relationship     | Notes                                       |
| ---------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Church Hierarchy**   | Ambiguous        | Officially condemned; practically tolerated |
| **Orthodox Faction**   | Supported By     | Cardinal Draconis provides legitimacy       |
| **Reformist Faction**  | Actively Opposed | Valens's network works against them         |
| **Inquisition**        | Complex          | Sometimes coordinate; sometimes conflict    |
| **Regency Council**    | Hostile          | Seen as threat to order                     |
| **Folk Practitioners** | Target           | Primary victims                             |
| **Goleuwyr**           | Target           | "Soulless" elves are popular targets        |
| **Urkhani**            | Target           | Considered literally demonic                |

# Part Six: Adventure Hooks

## 1. The Innocent Accused

**Situation:** A respected healer in a market town has been denounced as a witch. The local band will conduct a trial in three days. The healer is almost certainly innocent—the accusation came from a business rival. But the band won't accept evidence of innocence, only evidence of heresy (which can be manufactured).

**The Question:** Can the healer be saved? What would it take to discredit the accusation—or remove the band entirely?

**Complications:**
- The band has community support; openly opposing them is dangerous
- The business rival has other patrons who benefit from the healer's death
- "Rescuing" the healer makes the rescuers targets
- The healer may not want to flee—this is their home

## 2. The Wavering Torch-Bearer

**Situation:** Sister Severina's doubts have reached Cardinal Valens's network. A reformist agent wants to make contact—to offer her another path, to show her what she's becoming, to potentially turn the movement's most feared leader into its loudest critic.

**The Question:** Can Severina be reached before Blood Field corruption claims her? What would it take to change someone who's killed hundreds?

**Complications:**
- Approaching Severina means infiltrating her band
- Her subordinates are fiercely loyal and suspicious
- She may reject the offer and denounce the reformists
- If she's too far gone, the approach might make things worse
- Success would paint a target on Valens's entire network

## 3. The Hooded Council

**Situation:** Rumors of a coordinating body—the Hooded Council—have circulated for years. Now a dying band member has offered evidence: a meeting location, a date, a claim that the Council includes figures of influence including at least one cardinal.

**The Question:** Does the Council exist? Who's on it? And what would exposing them accomplish—or cost?

**Complications:**
- The dying member may be lying (or misinformed)
- The meeting location is in Orthodox-controlled territory
- Exposing the Council might unite the movement against a common enemy
- The Council might include people on multiple sides of Church politics
- Someone is already trying to ensure the evidence dies with its source

## 4. The Counter-Pyre

**Situation:** In a western province, a local lord has had enough. After the Scouring burned his daughter for "consorting with forest spirits" (she helped folk practitioners), he's raising armed forces to destroy every band in his territory. He's offering significant rewards for Torch-Bearers—delivered alive for his own tribunals.

**The Question:** Is this justice or vengeance? Can the lord's campaign succeed? And what happens when the Scouring starts creating martyrs?

**Complications:**
- The lord's methods may not be more just than the Scouring's
- Professional soldiers create refugees and destruction
- Martyrs strengthen movements; suppression may backfire
- The Church may be forced to choose sides publicly
- The daughter may not actually be dead—the folk practitioners might have saved her
