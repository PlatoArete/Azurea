The Revnan Tradition is the spiritual practice associated with Revna, the Dark Sister—the one who governs shadow, secrets, and the wisdom found in darkness. Unlike the Church's binary of Light-good/Dark-evil, Revnan practitioners understand darkness as necessary, complementary, and possessing its own truth.

The Church considers this heresy, obviously. Anything that doesn't equate darkness with evil challenges fundamental doctrine. Revnan practitioners have therefore operated in secret for centuries, maintaining their tradition through hidden circles while outwardly conforming to Solarian expectations.

Since the Passing damaged the Light-field while leaving the Dark-field apparently intact, Revnan practitioners have found themselves in an unusual position: their approach to spirituality suddenly seems validated, while the Church's claims about Light's supremacy seem undermined. This creates both opportunity and danger.

# Part One: Theology & Practice

## Core Beliefs

**Darkness Is Not Evil:**
The fundamental Revnan teaching rejects Light/Dark = Good/Evil equations. Darkness is necessary, natural, and good in its own way. Night follows day; shadows require light to cast them. The cosmos requires both.

**Truth Hides in Shadow:**
Surface appearances deceive. What's obvious is often wrong. Revnan practice emphasizes looking beneath, behind, and within—finding what's hidden rather than accepting what's shown.

**Wisdom Requires Descent:**
Real understanding comes from going down—into oneself, into darkness, into uncomfortable places. Comfort maintains illusion; discomfort reveals truth.

**The Veil Between:**
Revna's realm is described as "behind the veil"—the layer between apparent reality and deeper truth. Practitioners learn to perceive through that veil.

## Practices

| Practice              | Purpose                                          |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Night Vigil**       | Meditation in darkness; perceiving without light |
| **Veil-Work**         | Training to see through surfaces                 |
| **Dream Cultivation** | Learning from what the unconscious reveals       |
| **Shadow Dialogue**   | Conversing with one's own darkness               |
| **Secret Keeping**    | Sacred practice of protecting hidden truths      |

## The Dark-Field

Revnan practitioners work with the Dark-field—Revna's realm:
- Perceive what's hidden from normal sight
- Move in shadow more easily than others
- Access knowledge that wants to remain secret
- Protect secrets from discovery
- Navigate dreams and unconscious spaces

# Part Two: Structure & Leadership

## Organization

The tradition operates through hidden networks:

```
The Veiled (Senior practitioners; identity known to few)
    ↓
Circle Leaders (Coordinate local groups)
    ↓
Practitioners (Active members)
    ↓
Seekers (Those being tested for admission)
```

**Compartmentalization:**
For safety, practitioners know only their own circle and direct contacts. Even senior figures don't know the full network. This makes the tradition hard to destroy but also hard to coordinate.

## Key Figures

### The Widow (Name Unknown)

| Attribute | Value                                        |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Title** | The Widow                                    |
| **Role**  | Recognized senior authority (one of several) |
| **Age**   | Unknown                                      |

**Character:** The Widow is one of the Veiled—senior practitioners whose identities are protected. She's based in Mortuum, appropriate for the city devoted to death, and coordinates eastern circles.

She maintains the tradition's public face: a shadow-working network that serves those who need secrets kept, hidden things found, or truths revealed. This practical service legitimizes the tradition's existence (everyone needs secret-keepers) while hiding its spiritual dimension.

She's been watching the post-Passing developments with particular interest. The Light-field's weakness suggests the theological framework is changing. The Dark-field's stability suggests Revna's realm is positioned to matter more. She's preparing her practitioners for a world where shadow-work becomes more important.

**Goal:** To preserve and strengthen the tradition while positioning it for post-Passing significance.

**Complication:** The Widow has learned that someone is systematically exposing Revnan practitioners to the Inquisition. Someone with inside knowledge is betraying the network. Finding the traitor requires investigation that risks exposing more people.

### Umbral Davos

| Attribute | Value                            |
| --------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Title** | Keeper of the Eastern Hand       |
| **Role**  | Coordinates practical operations |
| **Age**   | 48                               |

**Character:** Davos manages the tradition's "mundane" operations: the network of secret-keepers, information brokers, and hidden service providers who make the tradition economically viable. He's less interested in theology than practicality.

He's built a shadow economy that serves everyone who needs what light can't provide—hiding assets, discovering secrets, protecting the vulnerable from those who'd exploit them. His clients include merchants, nobles, even Church officials. Everyone has secrets.

He sees the tradition's survival as primarily practical: provide services valuable enough that powerful people protect you. Theology is secondary to usefulness. This view puts him in occasional tension with more spiritually focused practitioners.

**Goal:** To build the tradition's practical value until it becomes too useful to destroy.

**Complication:** Davos has been approached by Urkhani representatives—the shadow-kin who also work in darkness. They're proposing cooperation. The alliance could strengthen both groups, but it also risks exposing the tradition to whatever attention the Urkhani attract.

### Initiate Vera

| Attribute | Value                                         |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Title** | None; known simply as Vera                    |
| **Role**  | Young practitioner; represents new generation |
| **Age**   | 24                                            |

**Character:** Vera came to the tradition after the Passing—one of many young people drawn to alternatives when the Church's Light-field confidence proved unfounded. She's intelligent, curious, and entirely uninterested in the cautious hiding that characterized previous generations.

She wants the tradition to emerge. Not fully—she understands the danger—but she believes continued hiding means dying slowly while the opportunity to matter slips away. The Church is fracturing. People are seeking alternatives. Why hide when people are looking for exactly what the tradition offers?

Her elders find her frustrating and refreshing in equal measure. She represents a future they're not sure they're ready for.

**Goal:** To push the tradition toward emergence and relevance while proving herself worthy of advancement.

**Complication:** Vera has begun teaching a small group of seekers without authorization from her superiors. She's building her own circle, which could either demonstrate her leadership potential or get everyone killed.

# Part Three: Goals & Tensions

## Primary Goal

**Preserve the Tradition**

The Revnan tradition has survived centuries of persecution. Its primary goal is continuing to exist and pass teachings to new generations.

## Secondary Goals

- **Expand Carefully:** Grow the tradition without attracting destruction
- **Provide Services:** Maintain practical operations that justify protection
- **Deepen Understanding:** Continue developing Dark-field knowledge
- **Prepare for Change:** Position for post-Passing spiritual restructuring

## Internal Tensions

### Hiding vs. Emergence
Should the tradition continue hiding or risk becoming visible? Different generations and individuals have different answers.

### Practical vs. Spiritual
Is the tradition primarily about services and survival, or about genuine spiritual truth? Both are present; emphasis varies.

### Cooperation vs. Independence
Should the tradition ally with other hidden groups (Urkhani, folk traditions) or maintain independence?

## External Tensions

### Church Hostility
"Darkness worship" is heresy requiring destruction. Any exposure means death.

### Inquisition Hunting
The Inquisition specifically targets groups like this. They're always searching.

### Urkhani Questions
The shadow-kin's interest is flattering or threatening, depending on interpretation.

# Part Four: Adventure Hooks

## 1. The Traitor Hunt

**Situation:** Someone is exposing Revnan practitioners to the Inquisition. The Widow needs help finding the traitor without exposing the investigation. This requires accessing both the hidden network and Inquisition movements.

**The Question:** Who's the traitor? Why are they betraying? And can they be stopped before more practitioners die?

**Complications:**
- Investigation risks exposing investigators
- The traitor has protected themselves carefully
- Motives may be complex, not simply hostile
- Finding them may require methods the tradition usually avoids
- The Inquisition may already know investigation is happening

## 2. The Urkhani Proposal

**Situation:** Davos needs help evaluating the Urkhani cooperation proposal. This means making contact with shadow-kin leadership, understanding what they actually want, and assessing whether alliance benefits or endangers the tradition.

**The Question:** Should the tradition ally with the Urkhani? What do the shadow-kin really want? And what happens when hidden peoples combine?

**Complications:**
- The Urkhani have their own agendas
- Alliance makes both groups more visible
- Complementary skills could be powerful
- Trust between hidden groups is inherently difficult
- Someone may be playing both sides
