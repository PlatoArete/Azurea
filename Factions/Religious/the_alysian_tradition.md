The Alysian Tradition is the folk practice centered on Alys, the Land Sister, and her realm of green, growing things. It's the spirituality of farmers, shepherds, foresters, and everyone whose life depends on what the land provides. Where the Church speaks of divine authority transcending nature, Alysian practice works within nature—negotiating with the land spirits, honoring the seasons, maintaining the agreements that make human life on Earth possible.

This is not organized religion. It's tradition handed down through families and communities: which offerings please the local landwights, when to plant and harvest, how to ask permission before cutting trees or breaking ground, what the land wants in return for its gifts. It's practical spirituality for people who need their fields to yield and their herds to prosper.

Since the Passing, the old agreements have strained. The land is angry—or frightened—and traditional practices don't always work as they should. Something has changed in how the green world responds to human presence.

# Part One: Theology & Practice

## Core Beliefs

**The Land Is Aware:**
The earth, trees, rivers, and all growing things possess spirits—not exactly conscious like humans, but aware in their own way. These spirits can be communicated with, bargained with, offended, and pleased.

**Reciprocity Is Essential:**
Humans take from the land. This is necessary for survival. But taking without giving back creates imbalance. Every harvest requires appropriate thanks. Every tree cut requires acknowledgment. Every field plowed requires permission.

**The Agreements Hold:**
Generations of practitioners have negotiated agreements with local land spirits: which areas can be farmed, which must remain wild, when certain things can be done. These agreements are sacred obligations passed down through generations.

**The Seasons Are Sacred:**
The turning year marks the land's cycles. Planting, growing, harvest, and fallow each have their rituals. Observing the seasons keeps practitioners aligned with the land's rhythms.

## The Seasonal Wheel

| Season                       | Focus                        | Observance                                  |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Imbolc** (Late Winter)     | First stirrings; ewes' milk  | Blessing seeds, purifying tools             |
| **Ostara** (Spring)          | Balance, renewal             | Planting rites, thanks for winter's end     |
| **Beltane** (Early Summer)   | Fertility, abundance         | Fire festivals, cattle blessing             |
| **Litha** (Midsummer)        | Full growth, height of power | Green feast, offering to the peaked sun     |
| **Lughnasadh** (Late Summer) | First harvest                | Grain offering, thanks for bread            |
| **Mabon** (Autumn)           | Balance, gratitude           | Harvest completion, storage blessing        |
| **Samhain** (Early Winter)   | Endings, thinning            | Thanks for the dead; wards against the wild |
| **Yule** (Midwinter)         | Return of light              | Evergreen blessing, hope-keeping            |

## Key Practices

**The Asking:**
Before taking anything significant from the land—clearing a field, cutting major timber, diverting a stream—practitioners must formally ask permission from the relevant spirits. This involves ritual, offering, and waiting for signs of response.

**The Offering:**
Regular gifts to local spirits maintain good relations: milk poured at crossroads, bread left for house spirits, firstfruits placed in field corners. These aren't bribes; they're maintenance of ongoing relationship.

**The Hedgewalk:**
Practitioners who develop particular sensitivity can enter a trance state allowing direct perception of land spirits. Hedgewalking is how major negotiations and spirit healings occur.

**The Warding:**
Not all spirits are benevolent. Some wild forces will harm humans given opportunity. Warding practices protect homes, fields, and communities from dangerous elements while respecting their right to exist elsewhere.

# Part Two: Structure & Leadership

## Organization

Alysian practice is organized through community and family rather than institution:

```
Wise Ones (Elder practitioners with decades of experience)
    ↓
Hedge-Speakers (Those who can communicate directly with spirits)
    ↓
Cunning Folk (Local practitioners serving their communities)
    ↓
Keepers (Household practice maintained by ordinary people)
```

**No Hierarchy:**
There is no centralized authority. Each community maintains its own traditions, which may vary significantly. The Wise Ones of one region have no authority over another.

**Knowledge Transmission:**
Practice passes through family lines and apprenticeship. Children learn from parents and grandparents. Those with particular gifts seek out Wise Ones for deeper training.

## Key Figures

### Grandmother Oakenshield (Elder Derwen)

*See Greenmarches Development for additional context*

| Attribute | Value                                              |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Title** | Elder Wise One of the Greenmarches                 |
| **Role**  | Most respected practitioner; Forest Edge custodian |
| **Age**   | 82                                                 |

**Character:** Elder Derwen Oakenshield has spent eight decades in conversation with the land—specifically, with the western edge of the Great Forest where her community has maintained agreements for centuries. She knows every tree personally, can read the forest's moods from the way leaves move, and has negotiated dozens of adjustments to the ancient agreements as circumstances changed.

She's watched the Passing from the forest's perspective. The trees are afraid. Something has changed in the deep woods, and the spirits that should be allies have become unreliable. The old agreements aren't being honored—not because humans broke them, but because the forest itself has forgotten.

She's trying to renegotiate, to establish new understandings for changed conditions. It's like talking to a friend who's suffered trauma and no longer quite recognizes you.

**Goal:** To restore the relationship between her community and the forest before something irreparable happens.

**Complication:** Derwen is being forced to acknowledge that her lifetime of accumulated knowledge may no longer apply. The land has changed fundamentally. New approaches are needed. But she's old, and learning new ways is hard, and the urgency won't wait for her to adapt.

### Derwen Greenmantle (Forest-Speaker)

| Attribute | Value                                        |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Title** | Forest-Speaker to the Duke of Oakhold        |
| **Role**  | Primary negotiator with Great Forest spirits |
| **Age**   | 45                                           |

**Character:** Greenmantle is the rare Alysian practitioner with official recognition. The Duke of Oakhold, recognizing that his prosperity depends on the Great Forest's tolerance of human presence, maintains a Forest-Speaker as formal liaison. Greenmantle holds this position.

He's deeply uncomfortable with it. Official status means the Duke expects results—and results aren't always possible when dealing with spirits who have their own agendas. The forest has become unpredictable since the Passing. Greenmantle often can't deliver what's promised on his behalf.

His real loyalty is to the forest, not the Duke. He'd rather the forest be allowed to do what it wants than forced to accommodate human needs. But he also knows that if he's removed, his replacement will be someone less careful about maintenance of relationship.

**Goal:** To protect the forest from human exploitation while protecting humans from forest hostility—an increasingly difficult balance.

**Complication:** Greenmantle has begun receiving messages from something deep in the forest—not the usual landwights he's familiar with, but something older and stranger. It's offering him power to enforce the forest's will. He hasn't said yes. He hasn't exactly said no.

# Part Three: Goals & Tensions

## Primary Goal

**Maintain the Agreements**

The Alysian tradition's primary function is maintaining the negotiated relationships between human communities and local land spirits. Everything else flows from this: prosperity when relationships are good, suffering when they fail.

## Secondary Goals

- **Preserve Knowledge:** Transmit traditional practices to the next generation
- **Protect Practitioners:** Resist Church persecution of "hedge witches"
- **Understand the Change:** Learn why the land responds differently since the Passing
- **Restore Balance:** Repair whatever has gone wrong in human-land relations

## Internal Tensions

### Regional Variation
Alysian practice differs significantly between regions. What works in the Greenmarches doesn't work in the Midlands. Practitioners sometimes disagree about "correct" approaches when the truth is that correctness is local.

### Traditional vs. Adaptive
The old practices worked for generations. Do they need updating because circumstances changed, or should practitioners double down on tradition? Both positions have advocates.

### Official vs. Hidden
Some practitioners (like Greenmantle) have official recognition. Most hide their practices from Church attention. These different situations create different perspectives on how to operate.

## External Tensions

### Church Hostility
The Church considers Alysian practice superstition at best, witchcraft at worst. The Scouring actively targets cunning folk. Even sympathetic clergy consider the tradition error.

### The Land's Mood
The land itself has become difficult. Spirits that should be friendly are hostile. Agreements are breaking down. The season isn't working properly. Something is wrong at a level practitioners don't fully understand.

### Development Pressure
As Imperial infrastructure has deteriorated, local lords are clearing more land for agriculture. This means more negotiations with spirits, more pressure on boundaries, more potential for conflict.

# Part Six: Adventure Hooks

## 1. The Broken Agreement

**Situation:** A farming community's harvest is failing. The traditional offering sites don't respond. The land spirits seem to have forgotten the centuries-old agreements. The community needs someone to determine what's wrong and renegotiate.

**The Question:** Why have the spirits forgotten? Can new agreements be established? And what do the spirits want now that they didn't before?

**Complications:**
- The spirits may have been woken to a new consciousness by the Passing
- Something may have displaced the original spirits
- The community may have unknowingly violated the old agreement
- Church authorities won't tolerate pagan negotiation in their territory
- The new agreement may require terms the community finds unacceptable

## 2. The Forest's Offer

**Situation:** Derwen Greenmantle has been offered power by something in the deep forest—power to enforce the forest's will against human encroachment. He hasn't accepted. He's terrified to. But the forest is being damaged by new logging operations the Duke has authorized. The offer becomes more tempting.

**The Question:** Should Greenmantle accept? What would it cost him? And is there another way to protect the forest?

**Complications:**
- The offering entity may not be what it claims
- Accepting might give the entity access to areas it shouldn't reach
- The logging is necessary for the community's survival
- The Duke will react badly to forest obstruction
- Greenmantle's replacement would be less protective of the forest

## 3. The Cunning Woman's Trial

**Situation:** Agnes Wellwater has been denounced to the Scouring as a witch. The accusation is technically accurate—she is a cunning woman who practices folk magic. But she's also healed countless people, eased births, and kept her community safe. Now she's fleeing, and the community must decide whether to protect or abandon her.

**The Question:** Can Agnes be saved? Should the community hide her? And what happens when the Scouring comes for those who helped?

**Complications:**
- Hiding Agnes endangers everyone who helps
- Some in the community genuinely believe she's a witch
- The Scouring band includes a conflicted member who might be turned
- Agnes has secrets she's not sharing about why she was targeted now
- Escaping permanently means leaving the community without its healer

## 4. The Wild Hunt

**Situation:** Something is moving through the countryside at night—a procession of spirits that shouldn't be active, led by something vast and terrible. Traditional wards aren't stopping them. They're taking people. The Wild Hunt hasn't ridden in living memory.

**The Question:** What woke the Hunt? What does it want? And can it be redirected, appeased, or stopped?

**Complications:**
- The Hunt is beyond normal practitioner capability
- Those taken aren't dying—they're being changed
- Traditional lore about the Hunt is fragmentary and possibly inaccurate
- The Church will blame practitioners for "summoning" the Hunt
- The Hunt may be responding to something worse that's coming
