The Academics are the intellectual tradition within the Solarian Church—theologians, natural philosophers, and scholars who believe understanding requires questions. They're not heretics; they're questioners. They accept Church doctrine but believe doctrine itself emerged from investigation, and investigation must continue.

This puts them in permanent tension with those who consider doctrine settled. Every generation, Academics push boundaries that conservatives find threatening. Every generation, some Academic arguments become accepted while others are condemned. The boundary between acceptable inquiry and heresy shifts constantly.

Since the Passing broke things that Church teaching said couldn't break, the Academics have gained influence. If the Light-field failed, the understanding that predicted its permanence was wrong. What else might be wrong? The questions that were once theoretical have become urgent.

# Part One: The Tradition

## What the Academics Do

Academic work combines several related activities:

**Theology:** Investigating what can be known about divine nature, Church teaching, and spiritual reality. This is the traditional core of Academic work.

**Natural Philosophy:** Studying the physical world through observation and reasoning. Since the Passing, attention has shifted sharply toward understanding the realm-fields.

**Historical Investigation:** Examining what actually happened in the past versus what tradition claims happened. This often produces uncomfortable findings.

**Textual Analysis:** Studying scriptures, ancient texts, and documentary evidence. Sometimes reveals translation errors or additions to texts considered authoritative.

## The Institutions

Academic work happens in several types of institution:

| Institution              | Character                | Politics                       |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| **University of Lexium** | Premier scholarly center | Relatively independent         |
| **Cathedral Schools**    | Training for clergy      | Mixed; depends on bishop       |
| **Monastic Libraries**   | Preservation focus       | Supportive of careful research |
| **Private Circles**      | Informal networks        | Most freedom; least protection |

# Part Two: Structure & Leadership

## Organization

Academics don't have formal faction structure—they're connected through institutions and networks:

**Institutional Positions:**
- University Chancellor, Deans, Faculty
- Cathedral School Rectors
- Library Directors

**Informal Networks:**
- Correspondence circles exchanging ideas
- Mentorship chains passing on methods
- Reading groups analyzing new works
- Protection networks hiding threatened colleagues

## Key Figures

### Chancellor Aeliana Verus

| Attribute | Value                                  |
| --------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Title** | Chancellor of the University of Lexium |
| **Role**  | Head of premier academic institution   |
| **Age**   | 54                                     |

**Character:** Aeliana has led Lexium for eight years—navigating the treacherous space between intellectual freedom and Church orthodoxy. She's a skilled politician who protects her scholars while maintaining relationships with Hierarchy that prevent interference.

Her own scholarship focuses on comparative religion—studying how different traditions understand the divine. This is borderline heretical under strict interpretation, but she frames it as understanding error to better combat it. Her actual conclusions, which she doesn't publish, suggest that multiple traditions have grasped different aspects of the same reality.

She's been quietly rebuilding Lexium's independence since the Passing. The current chaos offers opportunity: the Hierarchy is distracted, and scholarship proving practically useful gains tolerance. She's positioning the University to be essential.

**Goal:** To protect scholarly inquiry while expanding understanding of what the Passing revealed.

**Complication:** Aeliana has received demands from Cardinal Corvinus—the conservative Conclave faction—for lists of "heterodox" faculty to be investigated. She's delaying, but she can't resist forever without consequences.

### Doctor Hieronymus Glass

| Attribute | Value                           |
| --------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Title** | Professor of Natural Philosophy |
| **Role**  | Leading realm-field researcher  |
| **Age**   | 43                              |

**Character:** Hieronymus is the Empire's foremost scholar of realm-field theory—the study of how the Light-field (and other fields) actually function. Before the Passing, this was obscure academic work. Now it's urgently practical.

He's demonstrated that the Light-field operates according to consistent rules—rules that can be studied, measured, and potentially influenced. This makes him invaluable to everyone who wants to understand what happened and prevent it from happening again.

It also makes him dangerous. His findings suggest the Light-field isn't divine—or at least, not exclusively divine in the way the Church claims. It's a force that can be analyzed like any other force. This implication threatens foundational Church claims about the nature of divine power.

**Goal:** To understand the realm-fields completely, regardless of political implications.

**Complication:** Hieronymus has been approached by multiple factions—Church, Regency, even Dragon-Kin representatives—all wanting his research for their purposes. He's trying to remain independent, but neutrality becomes harder as his work becomes more valuable.

### Sister Scholastica

| Attribute | Value                                |
| --------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Title** | Senior Archivist, Lucidum Sanctum    |
| **Role**  | Guardian of Church's primary library |
| **Age**   | 71                                   |

**Character:** Scholastica has worked in Lucidum Sanctum for fifty years—starting as a junior copyist, rising to control the Church's most important collection. She knows what's in the archives better than anyone alive.

She also knows what's been removed—burned, hidden, or transferred to "secure" locations. Watching the archive's deliberate gaps has taught her about Church politics in ways no theology course could. She understands what the institution wants forgotten.

She's been quietly creating copies of texts she suspects will be targeted next. The copies are hidden in places she believes are secure. If the current crackdown intensifies, she'll have preserved what others want destroyed.

**Goal:** To protect knowledge from those who would destroy it for political convenience.

**Complication:** Scholastica knows things that could bring down senior Church figures—historical records that contradict official accounts, documentation of crimes attributed elsewhere, evidence that would reshape understanding of Church history. She hasn't shared these because she wasn't sure sharing was right. The calculus is changing.

# Part Three: Goals & Tensions

## Primary Goal

**Understand Truth**

The Academics believe truth can be discovered through investigation. Their primary goal is understanding—of divine nature, natural world, and spiritual reality.

## Secondary Goals

- **Protect Inquiry:** Defend scholarly freedom from political interference
- **Train Successors:** Ensure methods and knowledge pass to new generations
- **Apply Knowledge:** Use understanding to address practical problems
- **Reform Doctrine:** Correct Church teaching where evidence requires it

## Internal Tensions

### Freedom vs. Prudence
Unfettered inquiry produces dangerous conclusions. Some Academics self-censor; others refuse to. The boundary between courage and recklessness is debated.

### Scholarship vs. Activism
Should Academics remain neutral observers or use their knowledge to influence events? Different scholars have different answers.

### Secular vs. Religious
Some Academic work is theology; some is natural philosophy with no religious content. These traditions sometimes tension about priorities and methods.

## External Tensions

### Hierarchy Pressure
Church authorities want Academics to confirm doctrine, not question it. Pressure to conform is constant.

### Scouring Hostility
The Scouring considers questioning scholarship the first step toward heresy. They've targeted Academic institutions.

### Political Exploitation
Everyone wants Academic findings that support their positions and will suppress findings that don't.

# Part Four: Adventure Hooks

## 1. The Realm-Field Conference

**Situation:** Doctor Hieronymus has organized a conference to present realm-field research findings. Multiple factions want to influence, observe, or disrupt the conference. Security is becoming a concern.

**The Question:** Can the conference proceed safely? What findings will be presented? And who's willing to do what to control the conclusions?

**Complications:**
- Attendees include people hostile to each other
- The research has implications no one fully controls
- Inquisition observers are definitely present
- Someone may be planning violence
- The findings themselves may be destabilizing

## 2. Scholastica's Archive

**Situation:** Sister Scholastica has decided to share some of what she knows—but carefully, to people she trusts. She needs help evaluating who can be trusted and moving documents to secure locations before the crackdown she expects arrives.

**The Question:** What's in the hidden archive? Who can be trusted with it? And what happens when Church secrets start circulating?

**Complications:**
- Some documents are genuinely dangerous
- Trust is hard to verify
- Moving documents risks discovery
- The information will be used by people with various agendas
- Scholastica herself may be targeted once discovery happens
