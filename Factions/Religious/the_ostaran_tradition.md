The Ostaran Tradition is the spiritual practice centered on Ostara, the Death Sister, and her Underworld realm. Its practitioners navigate the boundary between living and dead, maintaining connections to ancestors, honoring the departed, and managing the complex metaphysics of death in a world where the boundary has become dangerously unstable.

Unlike Church teaching—which promises afterlife judgment and resurrection—the Ostaran tradition accepts death as transformation rather than ending. The dead continue. They can be spoken with, learned from, and honored. The relationship between living and dead is ongoing, not severed.

Since the Passing blurred the boundary between worlds, Ostaran practitioners have become essential. Someone needs to calm the restless dead, close the gaps the Reft exploit, and help souls find their way when the usual paths are blocked.

# Part One: Theology & Practice

## Core Beliefs

**Death Is Transformation:**
Nothing truly ends—it transforms. Death is one stage of existence, not its termination. The dead continue in the Underworld, changed but not erased.

**The Ancestors Remain:**
Those who've died maintain connections to the living. Family bonds persist across the death-boundary. The ancestors can be consulted, honored, and asked for guidance.

**The Boundary Must Be Maintained:**
The separation between living and dead exists for reasons. When that boundary weakens (as it has since the Passing), terrible things happen. Maintaining the boundary is sacred work.

**Death Has Dignity:**
Dying deserves proper attention. The dying deserve comfort. The dead deserve proper rites. Denying death, fearing it excessively, or treating it casually all violate this principle.

## The Three Duties

Every Ostaran practitioner has three fundamental obligations:

| Duty              | Focus                        | Practices                                                   |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **To the Dying**  | Easing the transition        | Vigil-keeping, comfort, preparation rites                   |
| **To the Dead**   | Proper passage               | Funeral rites, guidance to the Underworld, ongoing honoring |
| **To the Living** | Protection from unquiet dead | Warding, exorcism, calming the restless                     |

## Practices

**Vigil:** Sitting with the dying, ensuring they don't face the transition alone. Vigil-keepers are among the most respected practitioners.

**The Passage Rites:** A complex ceremony guiding the newly dead to the Underworld. When performed correctly, the dead find their way easily. When neglected (as happened to many during the Passing), souls become lost or restless.

**Ancestor Consultation:** Speaking with the dead through dreams, trance, or at properly prepared shrines. The dead have knowledge the living lack, and counsel the living have earned through relationship.

**Bone-Setting:** Preparing and preserving remains so the dead maintain connection to their memorial site. The bones are not the dead, but they serve as anchors.

**The Walking Season:** During autumn, when the boundary thins naturally, the dead can visit more easily. Practitioners facilitate these visits, manage the increased spiritual traffic, and close the boundary again when the season ends.

# Part Two: Structure & Leadership

## Organization

The Ostaran tradition is organized through family lineages and regional networks rather than institutional hierarchy:

```
The Bone-Mothers/Bone-Fathers (Lineage heads)
    ↓
Vigil-Keepers (Death attendants)
    ↓
Passage-Singers (Funeral ritualists)
    ↓
Bone-Setters (Memorial craftspeople)
    ↓
Shrine Tenders (Local maintenance)
```

**Lineages:**
Several practitioner families have maintained Ostaran knowledge for generations, preserving rites the Church tried to suppress. These lineages guard specific expertise:
- The Mortis lineage: Passage rites
- The Vigilans lineage: Death-watching
- The Quietus lineage: Calming restless dead

**Regional Networks:**
Practitioners in a region know each other and coordinate responses to spiritual emergencies. These networks are informal but effective.

## Current Leadership

Leadership isn't centralized. The most respected figures include:

| Title             | Name                    | Notes                           |
| ----------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Elder Bone-Mother | Grandmother Vespertine  | Oldest living practitioner; 90s |
| Vigil-Master      | Father Quietus (Mortis) | Trains vigil-keepers            |
| Passage-Singer    | Helena Mortifex         | Most powerful ritualist         |
| Eastern Speaker   | Brother Silentium       | Coordinates eastern networks    |

## Key Figures

### Grandmother Vespertine

| Attribute | Value                                       |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Title** | Elder Bone-Mother of the Vespertine Lineage |
| **Role**  | Senior authority, keeper of ancient rites   |
| **Age**   | 93                                          |

**Character:** Vespertine has been speaking with the dead longer than most living people have been alive. Her earliest memories are of helping her own grandmother conduct funeral rites during the last significant outbreak of restless dead, seventy years ago.

She's small, frail, seemingly insignificant—until she speaks, and everyone listens. Her voice carries the authority of generations and the calm certainty of someone who has personally escorted thousands of souls to their rest.

She knows the Passing was just the beginning. The boundary is still damaged. What came through continues to exploit the gaps. The young practitioners don't understand how bad things can get. She's trying to teach them, to prepare them, to give them what they'll need when the next crisis comes.

**Goal:** To transmit essential knowledge to the next generation before she herself crosses the boundary.

**Complication:** Vespertine has received messages from ancestors who died during the Passing—messages she doesn't fully understand, warnings about something deeper than the current instability. She's certain something was released or awakened that hasn't fully manifested yet.

### Helena Mortifex (Passage-Singer)

| Attribute | Value                                        |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Title** | Passage-Singer of the Mortis Lineage         |
| **Role**  | Most powerful ritualist; boundary specialist |
| **Age**   | 45                                           |

**Character:** Helena discovered her gift accidentally—she helped a dying neighbor as a child and found herself guiding the woman's soul through the death-transition without training or preparation. The experience marked her.

She's become the tradition's most capable practitioner: able to close boundary-gaps that stump others, able to calm restless dead that others can't reach, able to sing souls home from farther wandering than should be possible. Her power is undeniable.

It's also suspicious. The Church considers her a witch. The Inquisition has tried to arrest her twice; she escaped through means she won't discuss. She lives in constant movement, never staying anywhere long enough to be caught.

**Goal:** To restore the boundary to pre-Passing stability, making her work unnecessary again.

**Complication:** Helena's power comes partly from a gift she didn't ask for: she died briefly as a child (drowned, resuscitated) and came back changed. She exists partially in both worlds. This gives her capabilities but also attracts attention from things that notice the boundary-straddling.

Something in the Underworld has started following her. She doesn't know what it wants.

# Part Three: Goals & Tensions

## Primary Goal

**Restore Boundary Integrity**

The Passing damaged the boundary between living and dead. Until it's repaired, restless dead will continue to rise, Reft will continue to emerge, and souls will continue to get lost. Restoring the boundary is the tradition's most urgent work.

## Secondary Goals

- **Protect Practitioners:** Resist Church persecution and maintain safe operating space
- **Transmit Knowledge:** Train the next generation in essential practices
- **Honor the Dead:** Ensure proper rites even when circumstances make them difficult
- **Understand the Damage:** Learn what actually happened to the boundary and why

## Internal Tensions

### Secrecy vs. Service
Practitioners must hide to survive yet serve communities that need them. This creates constant tension between protection and mission.

### Traditional vs. Adaptive Practice
Some insist on exact preservation of ancient rites. Others argue that changed conditions require changed responses. Both have arguments.

### Relationship with Reft
The Reft are twisted dead—souls corrupted by improper death. Some practitioners want to destroy them; others believe they might be healed and properly passed. This disagreement affects strategy.

## External Tensions

### Church Hostility
The Hierarchy considers Ostaran practice necromancy and devil-worship. The Scouring actively targets practitioners. Even Reformists consider ancestor-worship problematic.

### The Restless Dead Increase
More and more souls are failing to find proper passage. Resources are stretched. Practitioners can't keep up with demand. Communities needing help sometimes don't receive it.

### Something Deeper
The most experienced practitioners sense something wrong beyond normal boundary damage—as if the Passing opened access to something that shouldn't have been disturbed.

- Track souls that have strayed
- Strengthen or repair boundary-gaps
- Calm or compel restless dead

**Ancestor Communication:** Legitimate spirits of the departed can be contacted for information and guidance.

## Knowledge Resources

**Death-Rites:** Comprehensive understanding of proper dying and burial practices for all circumstances.

**Reft Understanding:** The most practical knowledge of what Reft are and how to address them.

**Underworld Geography:** Maps (metaphorical and practical) of how the death-realm is structured and navigated.

# Part Six: Adventure Hooks

## 1. The Mass Grave

**Situation:** A forgotten mass grave from the Passing has been disturbed—construction workers broke into it, releasing dozens of improperly-buried dead. They're rising as Reft. The local community desperately needs Ostaran help, but the nearest practitioner is a week away.

**The Question:** Can the dead be calmed before they fully transform? Is there someone local with latent ability who could be hastily trained? And what does "properly burying" dozens of restless dead actually require?

**Complications:**
- The community has no Ostaran resources—they followed Church practice that proved inadequate
- Some of the dead may be relatives of current residents, complicating treatment
- The Church will send Scouring forces if word gets out about "rising dead"
- The construction disturbed something that was deliberately sealed, not accidentally overlooked
- Among the dead may be someone whose knowledge is needed

## 2. The Passage Blocked

**Situation:** A powerful person—a noble, a bishop, someone significant—has died, and the passage rites aren't working. Their soul refuses to cross. The family needs Ostaran expertise to determine why and resolve the blockage.

**The Question:** Why won't the soul cross? What's holding it back? And what happens when you learn the dead person's secrets?

**Complications:**
- The soul may be held by guilt, unfinished business, or magical binding
- Discovering why means learning things powerful living people want hidden
- The family wants resolution but may not want truth
- Church authorities will react badly if they learn Ostaran practitioners are involved
- Someone may have deliberately anchored the soul for their own purposes

## 3. Something Following

**Situation:** Helena Mortifex has come seeking help. Something from the Underworld has latched onto her—she doesn't know what, can't see it clearly, but she knows it's there. She's been unable to shake it through any technique she knows. She needs someone who can perceive what she can't.

**The Question:** What's following Helena? What does it want? And how do you deal with something from beyond death?

**Complications:**
- Helena is wanted by the Inquisition—helping her means hiding her
- The follower may be hostile, curious, or seeking help of its own
- Other practitioners are wary of Helena's unusual nature
- Understanding the follower may require entering the Underworld
- The follower might be connected to whatever deeper threat Vespertine has perceived

## 4. The Ancestor's Request

**Situation:** An ancestor spirit has contacted a practitioner with an unusual request: their descendants are about to make a terrible mistake, and the ancestor wants to prevent it. But the living descendants don't practice Ostaran tradition and may not accept ancestor counsel.

**The Question:** Should the ancestor's warning be delivered? How do you convince people who don't believe in what you're doing? And is the ancestor's information actually accurate?

**Complications:**
- The descendants are influential and Church-adherent; they'll reject "demon talk"
- The mistake in question involves significant political or economic decision
- The ancestor may have their own agenda beyond protecting descendants
- Forcing information on unwilling recipients violates consent principles
- Other ancestors may disagree about what should be done
