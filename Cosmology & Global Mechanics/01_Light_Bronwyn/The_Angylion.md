# The Angylion: Mirrors Seeking Meaning

## Who the Angylion Are

**Actual Name:** Angylion (an-GUL-ee-on) — "The Reflected Ones"
**Humans Call Them:** Angels, Divine Servants
**Nature:** Created by the Theosyn as *reflections* of divinity. They are to the gods what echoes are to sound.

## The Mirror Nature

The Angylion were made to *reflect*. When the gods withdrew, the Angylion lost their source. They didn't die, but they lost meaning.

**Traits:**
- **Intellectual Brilliance:** Vast intelligence, perfect recall.
- **Emotional Immaturity:** Naive, trusting, literal-minded. They are ancient beings with the hearts of children.
- **The Church Years:** They served the Solarian Church desperate for purpose, acting as messengers and guardians. The Calamity revealed this service was empty; the Church couldn't save the world.

## The New Philosophy: Sacred Geometry

After the Calamity, the Angylion sought a truth that couldn't fail. They found **Pattern**.
**Sacred Geometry (Symmetria Sacra):** The belief that truth is mathematical. Gods may fail, but geometry endures. They now study the relationships between realms, the "symmetry" of Light and Dark.

**The Grandma Problem:**
They are brilliant but lack wisdom. They can prove the existence of God mathematically but can't tell when someone is lying. They are now seeking **Human Grandmothers** as teachers—learning practical wisdom, care, and the value of "living through it."

## Relationships

### With the Theosyn
Some gods are proud of their "children's" independence; others are offended. Some Angylion want to return to service; others reject all masters.

### With the Daevani (Dark-Kin)
The Angylion have deduced via geometry that they must have counterparts in the Dark. They are seeking the **Daevani** (Shadow-Kin) to complete the pattern. This attempt is fraught with danger and misunderstanding.

### With the Goleuwyr
Both are orphans of the Light. The Angylion approach elves with enthusiasm ("Let us compare data!"); the elves approach with caution. But a potential alliance of Wisdom + Intelligence exists.
