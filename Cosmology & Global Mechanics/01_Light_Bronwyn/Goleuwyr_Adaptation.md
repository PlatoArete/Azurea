# Goleuwyr Adaptation: The Children of Light in Exile

## Who the Goleuwyr Are
**Name:** Goleuwyr (gohl-AY-weer) — "Light-People"
**Humans Call Them:** Elves, Fair Folk, Exiles
**Origin:** The mortal children of the Light realm. Not gods, not spirits, but people born in Bronwyn's radiance.

## Biological Adaptation

Elves adapt *biologically* to their environment/tradition, but the Goleuwyr are unique: they are adapted to a realm they no longer inhabit. They are "Light-adapted" beings living in a shadow world.

**Appearance:**
- **Luminous Skin:** Seems to catch and hold light.
- **Shifting Eyes:** Pale colors that change with emotion.
- **Hair:** Metallic (gold, silver, copper) or white.
- **Stillness:** An unnerving capacity for motionless waiting.

**The Wound of Exile:**
They physically *miss* the Light. The sun of Azurea is thin and weak compared to their home. They carry a deep, genetic grief.
**Lifespan:** Centuries to millennia. They remember the God-Giant War (and the Dragons' Withdrawal) personally.

## Religious Practice: Faith of the Unconquered Sun

**Core Belief:** The Light itself (Bronwyn-as-principle) is the true divinity. The gods (Theosyn) are powerful but fallible—they failed to protect the realm.
**Teaching:** *"The gods failed; the Light remains."*
**Practices:**
- **Dawn Worship:** Facing the rising sun as a reminder of the eternal Light.
- **Solar Geometry:** Sacred circles and rays in architecture.
- **Fire-Keeping:** Maintaining sacred flames as memories of home.
- **Aniconism:** No statues of Bronwyn (you cannot depict the infinite).

## Relations

### With the Solarian Church
The Church worships Light but persecutes the Children of Light. The elves view the Church as a tragedy: "So close to the truth, yet so corrupt."
**Factions:**
- **The Hidden:** Stay quiet, survive.
- **The Revealed:** Time to emerge and teach humans the truth.
- **The Bitter:** Hate the Church and humans.

### With the Theosyn
The elves feel betrayed by the gods who failed to save their home. The gods feel abandoned by worshippers who turned to abstraction. Trust is difficult.

### With Humans
Elves view humans with a mix of pity (so short-lived) and wariness (so violent). But they recognize that humans, too, seek the Light.
