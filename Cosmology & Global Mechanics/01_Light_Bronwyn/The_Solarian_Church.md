# The Solarian Church of the Covenant of Light

## History, Structure, and Beliefs

### The Institution
**Name:** The Solarian Church, or "the Church"
**Belief System:** The Covenant of Light
**Holy City:** Vandgwyn (The White City)

### The Founder: Solwyn

**What the Church Teaches:**
Solwyn was God Incarnate, the First Light, who descended to save humanity from darkness. He established the Covenant, built the First Cathedral, and sleeps beneath the altar to awake in humanity's hour of need.

**The Hidden Truth:**
Solwyn was a god-avatar (Theosyn), not the Creator. He was a builder and unifier who taught compassion and illumination. The Church corrupted his teachings, turning "illumination" into "judgment" and humility into absolute authority.

### Hierarchy

**The Supreme Pontiff:** The Luminary (Pontifex Lucis). Currently Aldric VII.
**The Conclave of Flames:** Twelve Cardinals who elect the Pontifex.
**Archprelates:** Regional leaders.
**Working Clergy:** Kindlers (priests) and Acolytes.
**The Inquisition:** The Office of Sacred Purity, led by the Grand Adjudicator.

### Theology and Doctrine

**Core Creed:**
*There is one Light, eternal and undivided.*
*From the Light, all goodness flows.*
*Darkness is the absence of God.*

**Key Doctrines:**
- **Monotheism:** Only the Light is divine; all else is demonic.
- **The Covenant:** Breaking it caused the Calamity.
- **Soteriology:** Souls return to the Light via the "Sending" sacrament.

### The Sacraments

1.  **Illumination (Baptism):** Holy fire passes through the recipient.
2.  **Unburdening (Confession):** Sin burned away by Light magic.
3.  **The Radiant Feast (Communion):** Consuming bread/wine infused with Light.
4.  **The Sending (Last Rites):** Illuminating the soul for its journey after death.

## The Fractured Church

Since the Calamity, the Church has splintered:

**The Hierarchy:** Maintaining the fiction of control. Corrupt, wealthy, focused on power.
**The Scouring:** Militant zealots burning "heretics" and non-humans.
**The Flagellants:** Wandering penitents seeking redemption through pain (tapping the **Blood Field**).
**The Monastics:** Withdrawn contemplatives preserving true faith/knowledge.
**The Academics:** Secretly questioning doctrine and studying forbidden texts.
**The General Clergy:** Heroic local priests trying to save their communities despite failing institutional support.

## Hidden Truths

### The Current Luminary
Aldric VII is mad/transformed. He entered the Founder's Tomb, touched the raw Light field (and others), and was broken open. He is sealed in the Sanctum; the Hierarchy forges his "pronouncements."

### The Devil's Doors
North-facing doors in old churches, originally for "heathen" worshippers of other traditions. Sealed by the later Church; now being secretly unsealed by the faithful seeking older truths.

### The Blood Field
An emergent realm fed by suffering. Flagellants and torturers accidentally tap this. It rewards pain with power. It is *hungry*.

### Katiari and the Tears
The Flagellants who weep find peace not from God, but from Katiari (The Abyss/Void), the forgotten sister who answers sorrow with erasure/relief.

## Relationships

### With the Older Traditions
**Theosyn:** The Church calls them saints. The gods resent this.
**Goleuwyr (Elves):** Persecuted as "soulless" or "children of darkness" (ironic, given they are Light children).
**Revnan (Dark):** Viewed as the ultimate enemy.

### Architecture
High spires (verticality). "Aspirations" to light. The "Quiet Corruption" of replacing white stone with gold.
