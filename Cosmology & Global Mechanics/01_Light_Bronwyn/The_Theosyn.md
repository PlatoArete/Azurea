# The Theosyn: The Gods Who Walk as Mirrors

## Who the Theosyn Are

**Actual Name:** Theosyn (THEE-oh-sin)
**Meaning:** "Divine Beings" or "God-Kin" — from Greek *theos* (god) + Brythonic *syn* (sense/essence)
**What Humans Call Them:** Gods, the Old Gods, the True Divines, the Saints (in Solarian usage)

The Theosyn are not the creators of the universe. They are not omnipotent, omniscient, or omnipresent. They are *people*—ancient, powerful, strange—but people nonetheless.

They were born from the Eldest Sister's tree, siblings to the **Giants and the Dragons**. But where the Giants chose destruction and the Dragons chose the deep sleep of withdrawal, the Theosyn chose the Light realm as their home. They were drawn to Bronwyn's radiance, shaped by it, became beings of illumination and truth.

## The Mirror Nature

**The Theosyn are shaped by belief.**

This is not metaphor. This is *literal mechanical truth* about how they function.

When mortals believe in a god, that belief *does something*. It doesn't create the god from nothing—the Theosyn exist independently of worship. But it shapes them, amplifies certain aspects, diminishes others. A god worshipped as wise finds wisdom flowing more easily. A god worshipped as cruel feels crueler impulses strengthened.

**The Mechanics:**
- Belief acts as a kind of resonance, amplifying aspects of the god that match the belief
- Lack of belief doesn't destroy—but it *diminishes*
- Contradictory beliefs create internal tension; the god must resolve or fragment
- The god retains agency—they can resist belief-pressure, but it costs effort
- Strong, widespread, consistent belief is like a current; swimming against it exhausts

## The Saint-Conversion

When the Solarian Church rose to power, it couldn't deny that the old gods existed—their avatars had walked the earth, performed miracles, left relics. The Church's solution was *reframing*.

The gods became saints. Divine beings in their own right became "holy servants of the one true Light." Their distinct natures were flattened into aspects of a single monotheistic God.

**The Reawakening:**
Now the Church fractures. The Passing shattered faith. People question. And in the questioning, in the cracks, old names are spoken again. The Theosyn are waking up. And they are *not* returning gently.

## Worship: The Way of the Many

**Core Principle:** The gods are real, distinct, and worthy of worship in their own right.

**Key Teachings:**
- *"The gods are many, and each is true"*
- *"They are what we worship, and we are how they act"*
- *"Honor all, but follow those who call you"*
- *"The gods can fail"* — They're powerful, not omnipotent.

## Relationships

### With the Solarian Church
The gods remember being saints. Most are not grateful. Some want vengeance. Some want restoration. Some want to reclaim their "saint" followers, revealing the truth gradually.

### With the Goleuwyr (Elves)
**The Wound:** The elves remember the gods as protectors who failed. The gods remember the elves as worshippers who stopped believing.
**Current State:** Both sides have legitimate grievances. Neither side is willing to fully extend trust. Yet they need each other.

### With the Angylion
Some Theosyn are proud of their "children" developing independence. Others are offended. Some are desperate for allies. The relationship is in flux.
