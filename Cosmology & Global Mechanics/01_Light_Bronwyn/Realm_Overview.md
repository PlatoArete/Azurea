# Realm Overview: The Light (Bronwyn)

## The Nature of the Light Realm

Before the god-giant war shattered the peace of the realms, the Light was home to three peoples who lived in Bronwyn's radiance. The realm itself was not merely "bright"—it was a place where truth was visible, where healing flowed like water, where glory was the natural state of being.

Bronwyn, the sister of Light, had become a tree like her siblings. But her realm remained—a field of radiance that permeated reality, that could be tapped for magic, that shaped those who dwelled within it.

The Light realm was:
- **Illuminating** — Nothing could be hidden; all was seen
- **Healing** — Wounds closed, sickness faded, bodies mended
- **Glorious** — Beauty was the default; ugliness required effort
- **True** — Lies were difficult; deception felt *wrong*

### The Shared Wound

All peoples of the Light (Theosyn, Goleuwyr, Angylion) share a common trauma: *the Light realm is no longer safe*.

The god-giant war made their home a battlefield. The Hawthorne barrier now prevents full return. Even if they could go back, what would they find? A realm scarred by divine conflict, emptied of its peoples, perhaps changed beyond recognition.

This shared loss shapes the Light traditions:
- The Theosyn remember power they can no longer fully wield
- The Goleuwyr remember a home they can no longer reach
- The Angylion remember purpose they can no longer fulfill

## Metaphysics of the Light Field

The Light is a **field** that permeates reality. It is associated with Bronwyn, but exists independently of her active will (as she sleeps).

**Key Resonance:**
- **Truth/Revelation**: Light reveals. Magic of detection, unmasking, and clarity.
- **Healing/Restoration**: Light restores the "true pattern" of a body, fixing damage.
- **Glory/Presence**: Light commands attention. Magic of awe, command, and leadership.
- **Order/Structure**: Light reveals the geometry of things.

**Magic as Narrative:**
Light magic works best with stories of:
- Dawn breaking after night
- Truth being revealed
- The King/Queen returning to set things right
- The wound being cleansed by fire or radiance

## Concepts of Divinity

**Bronwyn:** The Sister of Light. Sleeping. The source of the field.
**Solwyn:** A god-avatar of Light (Theosyn) who founded the Church.
**The Light (Abstract):** The principle worshipped by the Elves (Goleuwyr).
