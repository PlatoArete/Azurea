# Cosmological Truth (Worldbuilder Reference)

This document contains the hidden truths of the Azurea cosmos—information unknown to almost everyone in the world. It provides context for the specific traditions.

## The Sisters and the Realms

The universe was created by primordial sisters who emerged from chaos:

**The Eldest Sister** came first from primordial chaos. She created the universe and links all things together. Her "realm" is everything—including the nine realms her sisters would create. She eventually tired and "became a tree," her fruit birthing the **Gods, Giants, and Dragons** (The Tripartite Origin).

**The Other Sisters** appeared from the same chaos and joined their elder sister. They created the nine realms:

| Realm      | Sister    | Domain                                           | Status                       |
| ---------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| Light      | Bronwyn   | Radiance, truth, healing, glory                  | Became a tree, sleeping      |
| Dark       | Revna     | Shadow, secrecy, mystery, introspection          | Became a tree, sleeping      |
| Life       | Kasandra  | Growth, vitality, fertility, spring              | Became a tree, sleeping      |
| Death      | Ostara    | Decay, endings, spirits, ancestors               | Became a tree, sleeping      |
| Peaks      | Gwenaelle | Mountains, storms, stone, resilience             | Became a tree, sleeping      |
| Depths/Sea | Atargatis | Ocean, tides, the abyss below, the surface above | Became a tree, sleeping      |
| Land       | Alys      | Earth, forests, fae, seasons                     | Became a tree, sleeping      |
| Abyss      | Katiari   | Void, forgetting, erasure, absence               | **Hiding, awake, forgotten** |

**The Youngest Sister (Katiari)** is unique:
- She did not become a tree or birth mortal races
- She created the **Hawthorne**—a barrier protecting the realm where Azurea exists
- The Hawthorne prevents gods and giants from entering fully; they can only manifest as diminished avatars
- She then hid herself so completely that even the concept of her has been erased from memory
- Her realm, the Abyss, is the realm of forgetting—and she used this power to forget herself
- She is waiting to be found by a hero who can carry her story back to the world
- The paradox: she must be remembered in a way that doesn't break the spell of forgetting

## The Tripartite Schism (The Sundering)

- The eldest sister's fruit birthed the **Gods, Giants, and Dragons**.
- The **Dragons** foresaw conflict and chose to "sleep" or depart into the deep earth, refusing to partake in the coming war. This is known as *The Great Withdrawal*.
- The **Gods and Giants** battled each other, tearing through the realms (The God-Giant War).
- The younger sisters' children (humans, elves, and other mortal races) fled, eventually reaching Azurea.
- Katiari created the Hawthorne to protect Azurea from the war
- Unable to enter fully, gods and giants continued their conflict through **proxy war**—sending avatars to fight on Azurea
- The giants' avatars eventually "slept" and became landmarks (mountains, lakes, cursed places)
- The gods' avatars "died" and their bodies became **relics**
- The war eventually exhausted itself, leaving only echoes and remains

## The Realms as Fields

The nine realms are not just places—they are **fields** in a quantum field theory sense. They permeate all reality and can be tapped for magical energy.

**How Magic Works:**
1. **Coupling**: A practitioner attunes to a specific realm-field (through training, ordination, or natural affinity)
2. **Extraction**: They draw energy from the field
3. **Shaping**: They direct that energy into effects

**Magic is Storytelling:**
All magic operates through narrative. When a practitioner casts a spell, they tell a story that resonates with the relevant realm-field. The field responds by making the story *true* in the moment.

- Stories don't have to be historically accurate—they need *narrative truth*
- Different traditions have different stories attuned to different fields
- Corrupted or hollow stories produce weaker magic
- The stories shape the magic's character; a healing story emphasizing punishment might twist the effect

## The Calamity (The Passing)

The recent catastrophe that shattered the Empire:

- Eldritch creatures of incomprehensible nature passed through/near Azurea
- They came from *within* the realm protected by the Hawthorne—not from outside
- They may be from realms beyond the nine, or primordial things that coalesced soon after the sisters
- They did not seem to notice humanity; the destruction was incidental
- The devastation was immense—cities fell, populations died, the Empire collapsed
- The Church's failure to prevent or explain this shattered its authority
- The mass suffering may have supercharged the emergent **Blood Field**
