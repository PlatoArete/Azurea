# Realm Overview: Death (Ostara)

## The Nature of Ostara: The Patient Gatherer

Ostara is not a hunter; she is a gatherer. She has no urgency because she has eternity. Every soul comes to her eventually.

**Names:**
- The Gatherer
- The Patient One
- The Warm Dark
- The Final Mother
- Keeper of Stories

**Relationship to Life:**
The exhale to Kasandra's inhale. ostara "adores" life because more life means more stories to treasure.

**Blessing to the Dying:**
*"Well done, oh child. You were magnificent. Rest now. Come home."*

## The Core Theology

### The Five Principles
1.  **Death is not an enemy.** It is a homecoming.
2.  **Life is sacred precisely because it ends.** Finitude makes it precious.
3.  **Fight for life ardently.** Ostara loves those who resist her most (healers, survivors). It makes the story better.
4.  **Do not presume upon death's domain.** Murder is theft. War is not worship.
5.  **Honor the dead.** They are home, not gone.

### The Great Paradox
Fight death in others (proving love of life) while accepting it in yourself (proving trust in Ostara).

### The Underworld
Ostara's realm touches the physical world in deep places.
- **Characteristics:** Bioluminescence, stable temperature, thin veil between living and dead.
- **Not Hell:** A place of life, just different life.
