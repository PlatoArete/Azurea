# The Ostaran Tradition: Faith of the Patient Gatherer

## Practices

**Ancestor Veneration:**
- **Shrines:** Kept in every home.
- **Speaking with the Dead:** Normal, not sinister. Invited, not summoned.
- **Grave Tending:** Keeping plots clean but allowing natural decay (memento mori).

**Festivals:**
- **The Festival of Remembrance:** The dead return for dinner. Places set, stories told, lights lit.

## The Undead

**Categories:**
1.  **The Returned (Willing):** Ancestors, guardians. Honored guests.
2.  **The Lost (Unwilling):** Confused spirits. Need guidance (Psychopomp work).
3.  **The Corrupted:** Damaged by evil/Blood Field. Need cleansing.
4.  **The Abominations:** Created by force. MUST be destroyed.

**Spirit Vessels:**
Constructs (ceramic, bone, stone) inhabited by *willing* souls to serve as guardians. This is consensual, unlike necromancy.

## Death Cults (The Enemy)

True Ostarans hate death cults.
- **Cults:** Hasten death, murder as worship, enslave spirits.
- **Ostarans:** Fight death, murder is theft, honor spirits.

**The Irony:** The Church persecutes Ostarans as death cultists, while Ostarans are the only ones equipped to stop actual death cults.

## Aesthetic

**Beautiful Decay:**
- Moss, licensure, weathering.
- **Memento Mori:** Skulls and bones as reminders to live fully.
- **Fungi:** Cultivated as sacred cleaners.
