# The Revnan Tradition: Mysteries of the Necessary Dark

## Core Principles

**The Complementary Truth:** Light reveals the surface; Dark reveals the depth. Both are necessary.
**The Three Errors:**
1.  **Light Chauvinism (Church):** Ignoring the dark.
2.  **Dark Chauvinism:** Ignoring the light (becoming what you hate).
3.  **Abyss-Seeking:** Confusing Revna's generative darkness with Katiari's consuming void.

## The Mystery Structure

The tradition is knowledge revealed in stages (protection, not hoarding).

**Stages:**
1.  **The Veiled (Novices):** Unlearning fear of the dark.
2.  **The Shadowed (Accepted):** Learning non-visual perception; dream work.
3.  **The Obscured (Deepened):** Understanding ethics of secrets and protection.
4.  **The Tenebrous (Darkened):** Perceiving truths that cannot exist in light.
5.  **The Abyssal (Whispered):** Touching the edges of the unknowable (Katiari). Dangerous.

## Practices

**Star Liturgy:** Reading the night sky as a sacred text/map.
**Dark Meditation:** Extended periods in darkness to open inner eyes.
**The Vigil:** Staying awake sunset to sunrise to watch the cycle.
**Cave Retreats:** Going deep into the earth (Urkhani sites).
**The Telling and Forgetting:** Sacred act of hearing a truth once and rituals to forget it consciously, letting it become subconscious wisdom.
**Dream Work:** Lucid dreaming and shared dream-space.

## Dangers

**The Dark Chauvinists:** Bitter practitioners who hate the Light. They practice harmful magic and confirm Church propaganda.
**The Abyss-Touched:** Those who pushed too far into the 5th stage and touched the Void. They become Lost (catatonic), Fractured (mad), or Hungry (draining life).
