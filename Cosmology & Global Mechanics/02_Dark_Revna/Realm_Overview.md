# Realm Overview: The Dark (Revna)

## The Nature of Revna: She Who Completes the Truth

**Revna is not evil. Revna is the other half of truth.**
Light reveals what *is*. Dark reveals what *could be*.
Light shows the surface. Dark shows the depth.

Revna is shadow, secrecy, mystery, and introspection. She is the darkness of the womb where life gestates. She is the darkness of the cave where ancestors found safety. She is the night sky where stars—visible only in darkness—reveal the cosmos.

**Names:**
- The Necessary Dark
- The Veiled One
- Star-Mother
- She of the Deep Places

**Relationship to Light:**
Revna and Bronwyn are not enemies; they are complements, like two eyes creating depth perception. The Church's error is "Light Chauvinism"—closing one eye and calling it holy.

## The Metaphysics of Darkness

**Key Resonance:**
- **Gestation:** Things grow in the dark before emerging (seeds, embryos, ideas).
- **Safety:** Darkness hides the vulnerable from predators.
- **Rest:** Darkness allows recovery.
- **Introspection:** Looking inward requires shutting out the external ("going dark").
- **Revelation:** Some things (stars, bioluminescence, subtle truths) are only visible when the blinding light is gone.

**Magic as Narrative:**
Revnan magic works with stories of:
- Hiding and protecting
- Waiting for the right moment (gestation)
- Revealing deep/uncomfortable truths
- Navigating by stars
- The peace of the cave

## Concepts of Divinity

**Revna:** The Sister of Dark. Sleeping.
**Divine Beings:** The Daevani (demons) are her native children, as the Theosyn were to Bronwyn. The Daevani are not "fallen" but distinct beings of shadow.
