# Realm Overview: Life (Kasandra)

## The Nature of Kasandra: The Living Flame

Kasandra is not a goddess *of* life—she *is* life. She is the urge that pushes the shoot through soil, the hunger of the wolf, the passion of lovers.

**Names:**
- The Living Flame
- The Great Mother
- She of the Swelling
- The Green Rush

**Relationship to Death:**
Kasandra and Ostara are partners/lovers. Life feeds death; death feeds life. They are the "Two Who Are One" in some ancient traditions.

## The Metaphysics of Vitality

**Life-Force (Vitae/The Green):**
flows through all things.
- **High Vitality:** Children, pregnant beings, spring growth.
- **Moderate Vitality:** Healthy adults, summer growth.
- **Low Vitality:** The elderly, the ill.

**The Flow:**
Vitality must circulate. Hoarded life becomes cancer or stagnation; shared life multiplies.

**Relationship to Other Realms:**
- **Bronwyn (Light):** Sunlight feeds growth. Allies.
- **Alys (Land):** The ground in which Life grows. Mother/Daughter relationship.
- **Atargatis (Depths):** Water is the medium of life.
- **The Blood Field:** ENEMIES. Blood feeds on suffering; Life is flourishing.
