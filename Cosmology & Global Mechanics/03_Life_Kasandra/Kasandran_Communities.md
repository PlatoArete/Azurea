# Kasandran Communities: The Living Family

## Social Structure

**The Community is the Family:**
No nuclear families. No marriage. No exclusive inheritance.
- Adults live communally (shared resources, fluid relationships).
- "Love" is abundant, not scarce.
- Stability usually exceeds that of family-based societies because risk is distributed.

## Children

**Belong to Kasandra:**
- **Conception:** Often ritualized; paternity deliberately uncertain so no man claims the child.
- **The Giving:** At age 2-3, children move to the **Children's House**.
- **Child-Tenders:** Dedicated caregivers (highly honored) raise the cohort.
- **Cohorts:** Children raised together form lifelong sibling bonds.
- **Emergence:** Coming-of-age ritual where they enter the adult community.

**The "Child Sacrifice" Lie:**
The Church claims Kasandrans kill children. In reality, they protect them fiercely. The "Giving" is dedication to the Children's House, not death.

## Daily Life

**Housing:** Communal sleeping halls, dining halls, bathhouses.
**Work:** Shared based on ability/preference.
**practitioners:**
- **Vitae-Keepers:** Priests/Gardeners.
- **Child-Tenders:** Educators/Nurturers.
- **Pleasure-Workers:** Musicians, Cooks, Hierodules.
- **Life-Healers:** Midwives, Herbalists.

## Festivals

**The Cycle:**
- **Seed-Time:** Spring planting/conception.
- **Bloom-Time:** Courtship/Beauty.
- **Green-Time:** Peak growth/Ecstasy.
- **Ripen-Time:** Harvest/Fulfillment.
- **Dark-Time:** Winter rest/Ostara-honoring.
