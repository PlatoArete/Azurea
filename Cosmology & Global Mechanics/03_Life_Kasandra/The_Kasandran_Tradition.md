# The Kasandran Tradition: Ways of the Living Flame

## The Two Paths

Complementary approaches often practiced in rhythm (Ecstasy for festivals, Equilibrium for daily life).

### 1. The Path of Ecstasy (Dionysian)
**Core:** Life overflows limits. Dissolve the self to let the goddess flow through.
**Practices:**
- **Sacred Intoxication:** Wine/substances as sacraments.
- **Sacred Dance:** Possession through movement.
- **Sacred Sexuality:** Union as worship.
- **The Revel:** Controlled chaos to release pressure.

### 2. The Path of Equilibrium (Epicurean)
**Core:** Pleasure is good, but balance is better. Sustainable flourishing over peak intensity.
**Practices:**
- **Hedonic Calculus:** Will this pleasure lead to pain?
- **Ataraxia:** The undisturbed mind; contentment.
- **Simple Pleasures:** Food, drink, rest, connection.

## Sacred Sexuality

**Core Teaching:** Sex is sacred participation in creation.
- **Consent is Sacred:** Forced acts are anathema.
- **Pleasure is the Point:** Pain without pleasure is damage.
- **Diversity of Desire:** Kasandra delights in variety. Same-gender, multi-partner, fluid orientation—all are sacred if they flourish.

**Practices:**
- **Hierodules:** Voluntary temple servers offering sexual healing/connection.
- **The Great Marriage:** Ritual union ensuring land fertility.
- **Communal Sexuality:** Festival participation (optional but honored).

## Theology

**Seven Principles:**
1. Life Seeks Life (Desire is holy).
2. Pleasure is Wisdom (Body knows what it needs).
3. Creation is Participation.
4. Sharing Multiplies.
5. Bodies Are Sacred.
6. Change is Life.
7. Balance Sustains.
