# Realm Overview: Emergent Fields

## The Theory of Emergence
**Phase Transition:** New fields can crystallize at the threshold between two primary fields if the dynamic oscillation is "frozen" by belief and practice.
**Nucleation:** Requires a community to hold themselves in a static state of tension at a boundary (e.g., between Life and Death).

## Known Emergent Fields
1.  **The Blood Field:**
    *   **Threshold:** Life / Death (frozen).
    *   **Source:** Suffering, torture, martyrdom (Flagellants).
    *   **Nature:** Parasitic, hungry, rewards pain with power.
2.  **The Null Field (Potential):**
    *   **Threshold:** Light / Dark (cancelled).
    *   **Source:** Grief that rejects definition (Twilight Mourners).
    *   **Nature:** Absence of definition, "undefined" state.

## The Danger
Unlike primary realms, emergent fields are not fundamental. They are accidental, often parasitic, and can create feedback loops (e.g., the Blood Field encourages pain to feed itself). They are "accidental metaphysics."
