## The Mukir (Contract-Keepers)
**Role:** Extractors/Negotiators. They pay rent to the mountain.
**Culture:** Everything is a contract. Dark humor ("The mountain will kill us eventually; it's in the fine print").
**Appearance:** Small, dense, stone-colored skin. Extra joints for mining.

## The Kobalthari (Cobalt-Wardens)
**Role:** Interpreters. They read veins and etch runes to conduct power.
