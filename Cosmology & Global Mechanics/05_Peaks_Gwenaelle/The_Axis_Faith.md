# The Axis Faith: Tradition of the Meeting Point

## Theology

**Power is Neutral:** what matters is *use*.
- **Wise:** Channeled, shared, balanced.
- **Foolish:** Unleashed, hoarded, extractive.

**Core Principles:**
1.  **Power flows; do not dam it.** Hoarding is spiritual illness.
2.  **Transformation is sacred.** (Ore -> Blade; Storm -> Rain).
3.  **Balance maintains the circuit.**
4.  **Above and Below are one.**

## Practices

**The Marketplace as Worship:**
Commerce is the physical enactment of "power flowing."
- Barter only.
- Cheating is blasphemy.
- The marketplace is the Emergence Level of the temple.

**The High Forge Ritual:**
The most sacred ceremony where all races cooperate to create artifacts of power.

## Aesthetic

**Architecture:**
- **Zone 1 (Deep):** Brutalist, massive stone, rune-etched.
- **Zone 2 (High):** Flexible, organic, wind-driven (now largely destroyed).
- **Zone 3 (Meeting):** Synthesis. Stone foundations with (now damaged) silk spires.
