# Realm Overview: Peaks (Gwenaelle)

## The Nature of Gwenaelle: The Axis of Power

Gwenaelle is **Power**—transformation made geography. She is the meeting point between:
- **Stored Power (Below):** Stone, ore, potential energy.
- **Active Power (Above):** Storm, wind, kinetic energy.

**Aspects:**
- **Storm-Face (Active):** Destruction, renewal, motion.
- **Stone-Heart (Passive):** Endurance, patience, wealth.

## The Symbiosis: The Great Circuit

The Axis system relies on the flow of power between Above and Below:
1.  Mukir extract ore.
2.  Kobalthari read veins.
3.  Korvathrim forge.
4.  Aetherwings/Nephilim guide weather for the forge.
5.  Sythkarai weave the meeting place.
6.  Power flows; balance is maintained.

**The Aurora:** The visible light of the divine forge deep within the mountains.

## The Crisis: The Passing

The "Passing" devastated the Surveyor races (sky-dwellers).
- **Surveyor Devastation:** Cloud-cities destroyed, Aetherwings traumatized.
- **The Wound:** Axis temples lost their upper (silk/cloud & structure) halves.
- **The Response:** Reconstruction is happening, but it is "grieving architecture"—heavier, more anchored. The circuit flows weakly.
