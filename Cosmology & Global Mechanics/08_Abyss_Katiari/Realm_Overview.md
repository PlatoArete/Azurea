# Realm Overview: The Abyss

## The Nature of the Realm
**The Primordial Medium:** The Abyss is not a "realm" created by a sister, but the recognition of the primordial potential from which all things emerged. It is the "ocean floor" of existence.
**Domains:** Forgetting, Absence, Potential, Boundaries, Hope.
**Katiari's Role:** The Youngest Sister recognized the Abyss and became its consciousness. She did not become a tree; she remains awake, hidden within the void.

## The Geography of Nothing
**The Void:** Not empty space, but "full" nothingness—undifferentiated potential.
**The Hawthorne:** A barrier of impossible thorns created by Katiari to protect Azurea (the Land) from the God-Giant War. It is rooted in the Abyss.
**Thresholds:** Every boundary (between light/dark, life/death, land/sea) eventually touches the Abyss.

## Inhabitants
**Katiari:** The Hidden Sister.
**The Forgotten:** Things erased from memory return here.
**The Hero (Potential):** Humanity was created from this realm, inheriting the nature of hope and forgetting.

## The Paradox
The Abyss is the drain (entropy/forgetting) but also the source (emergence/potential). Katiari sits at the center, holding the memory of what must be forgotten so that it can one day be remembered.
