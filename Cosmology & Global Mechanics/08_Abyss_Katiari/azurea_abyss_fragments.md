# Concerning the Forgotten: A Collection of Fragments
## Being an Attempt to Document What Cannot Be Known

---

*Compiler's Note: This collection represents thirty years of research into phenomena that resist documentation. Many sources are fragmentary. Cross-references often contradict. Several contributing scholars have since become unable to continue their work—some through death, some through circumstances that defy easy explanation. I present these fragments without claiming to understand them. Perhaps understanding is not possible. Perhaps the attempt to understand is itself the point.*

# Part I: The Absence That Is Present
## Reports from Those Who Sense the Gap

### Fragment 1: From the Private Journal of Revnan Hierophant Solas, Fifth Stage Initiate

> *I have gone too far.*
> 
> *They told me the Fifth Stage was dangerous. They told me that some who push into the deepest dark find something other than Revna there. I thought I understood. I thought "something other" meant a demon, or a trap, or simply madness.*
> 
> *It is none of these things.*
> 
> *At the bottom of the dark, where even shadows cannot exist because there is nothing to cast them, I found... not emptiness. Not presence. A shape made of absence. A memory of something that should be there but has been so thoroughly removed that only the removal remains.*
> 
> *I tried to look at it. My eyes went somewhere else. I tried to name it. My mouth made sounds that meant nothing. I tried to remember it afterward. The memory is there, but it contains nothing—a sealed room in my mind with no door.*
> 
> *I am not mad. I am not broken. But I know now that our tradition guards the border of something vast and empty and waiting. We call ourselves Revnan, children of the Dark. We did not know that Dark is only the antechamber.*

*[The remainder of this journal was found blank. Hierophant Solas reportedly continued to write for three more years, but the pages hold no visible marks.]*

### Fragment 2: Testimony of Grandmother Yew, Fae of the Western Groves

*Recorded by Scholar Caitrin, subsequently committed to the Monastery of Uncertain Memory*

> CAITRIN: You said your people remember something about the youngest.
> 
> YEW: We remember that we have forgotten. This is different from not knowing. You humans do not know many things—you do not know how to speak with trees, how to taste the color of seasons. This is ignorance. What we have is *awareness of absence*.
> 
> CAITRIN: Can you describe the absence?
> 
> YEW: Describe the shape of a word you have never learned. Describe the color of a light that does not exist. *[Long pause]* We tended trees before the migrations. Seven trees of the sisters. We remember tending seven. But when I count the sisters, I count eight. The eighth... *[Extended silence]*
> 
> CAITRIN: Grandmother?
> 
> YEW: I had something to tell you. I have forgotten what it was. This happens often, when I speak of... when I speak of... I'm sorry, child. What were we discussing?
> 
> CAITRIN: The eighth sister.
> 
> YEW: There is no eighth sister. There are seven sisters and the Eldest. Everyone knows this. Why would you ask about an eighth?
> 
> *[At this point in the recording, Scholar Caitrin's notes indicate that she herself could not remember why she had asked the question.]*

### Fragment 3: The Children's Rhyme of Nowhere

*Collected from multiple regions. Variants exist, but certain elements remain constant.*

> *One for Light and one for Dark,*
> *One for Life and one for hark—*
> *Listen, listen, can you hear?*
> *One for Death who holds us dear,*
> *One for Mountain, one for Sea,*
> *One for Land where spirits be,*
> *One for... one for... one for...*

*Children consistently stumble on the eighth line. When asked what comes next, they typically cannot remember that there WAS a next line. Several children, when pressed, have reported "the lady who isn't there," but cannot elaborate. Follow-up interviews conducted within days show no memory of the original conversation.*

# Part II: The Sorrowful Ones
## Those Who Grieve What They Cannot Name

### Fragment 4: Diagnostic Notes, Healer Thomasin of the Ostaran Hospice

> *Patient presents with profound, persistent grief. No recent loss. No identifiable trauma. Patient reports "missing something" but cannot specify what. Physical examination normal. Spirit-sight examination shows unusual pattern—patient's soul-light dims periodically as if reaching toward something that isn't there.*
> 
> *This is the fourteenth such case this season. All present similarly: deep sorrow, no identifiable cause, inability to articulate what has been lost. They are drawn to each other—three of my patients have formed an informal support group, sitting together in silence, occasionally weeping.*
> 
> *When I asked what they discuss, they said they don't discuss anything. They simply share the grief. Somehow, being near others who feel the same loss makes it bearable.*
> 
> *I consulted the monastery archives. Similar cases appear throughout history, scattered, rare. They increase dramatically after catastrophes—after the Sundering, after the Great Migration, after the Passing. As if great upheaval cracks open something that allows this grief to leak through.*
> 
> *They are not mad. They are not ill. They are mourning correctly—mourning something real that they cannot remember.*
> 
> *I have begun to feel it myself.*

---

### Fragment 5: Letter from Inquisitor Aldous to the Office of Sacred Purity

*Discovered in Church archives. Never delivered. Aldous's subsequent fate unknown.*

> Your Eminence,
> 
> I write to report a heresy so subtle I am uncertain it IS a heresy.
> 
> Among the Flagellant bands, I have identified a subset who differ from their brothers. Where the main movement seeks purification through pain—scourging themselves, starving, mortifying the flesh—these individuals practice what they call "the Weeping."
> 
> They do not whip themselves. They simply... grieve. They gather at twilight, they pray to no particular saint, and they weep. Not for sins, not for the dead, not for the world's suffering. When asked what they mourn, they cannot say.
> 
> Here is the heresy, if heresy it is: they report that the weeping brings peace. Not the righteous satisfaction of penance performed, but a strange, quiet peace, as if something hears them and responds with—I struggle for words—*absolution without judgment*.
> 
> The Light does not forgive without repentance. The Light demands acknowledgment of sin. Whatever answers these people is not the Light.
> 
> I should condemn them. I should bring them before the Office. But Your Eminence, I have begun to weep with them. At twilight. For no reason I can name. And the peace...
> 
> I have enclosed no evidence with this letter. I am no longer certain I should send it.

*[Marginal note in different hand: "Aldous returned from investigation changed. Requested transfer to contemplative order. No heresy documented."]*

### Fragment 6: Observations on the Sorrowful Ones

*Compiled from multiple scholarly sources*

**Common Characteristics:**

- Profound grief without identifiable cause
- Inability to articulate what has been lost
- Drawn to others with the same condition
- Often find relief in twilight hours or liminal spaces
- Frequently describe "the peace of being forgotten"
- Surprisingly functional despite ongoing grief

**Notable Patterns:**

| Pattern | Frequency | Notes |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| Onset after personal loss | Common | Loss seems to "open" awareness |
| Onset after near-death | Less common | Threshold experience |
| Onset spontaneous | Rare | May indicate natural attunement |
| Increased incidence post-Passing | Documented | Mass trauma as trigger |
| Familial clustering | Occasional | Genetic component? Or learned awareness? |

**Scholarly Speculation:**

Several researchers have proposed that the Sorrowful Ones are perceiving something real—an absence in the structure of existence that most people cannot sense. Their grief is appropriate response to genuine loss, even though the lost thing cannot be remembered.

This theory is unfalsifiable. It is also, in this compiler's opinion, likely correct.

# Part III: The Mad Seers
## Those Who Saw Too Much

### Fragment 7: Transcript of the Prophet Aleron's Final Proclamation

*Aleron was a respected oracle of the Light before his breakdown. This proclamation was delivered in the Grand Cathedral of Vandgwyn before his forced removal.*

> THERE IS A HOLE IN THE WORLD.
> 
> I have seen it. When I looked upon the Light—the true Light, not your candles, not your sun, the SOURCE—I saw that it was incomplete. A piece is missing. The Light knows. The Light grieves.
> 
> You worship a wounded god. Not wounded by enemy, not wounded by sin. Wounded by ABSENCE. Something was torn away so thoroughly that even the Light cannot see what is gone.
> 
> I looked for it. I looked everywhere the Light could reach. And then I looked where the Light could NOT reach, and I found—
> 
> I found—
> 
> I found—

*[Guards removed Aleron at this point. He repeated "I found" for three more days before falling silent. He lived another twenty years in the Monastery of Uncertain Memory, never speaking again, occasionally weeping without apparent cause.]*

### Fragment 8: The Shared Imagery of Prophetic Collapse

*Cross-referenced from forty-seven cases of prophetic madness over four centuries*

Those who break while attempting to perceive divine truth often report similar imagery in their final coherent statements:

- "The hole in the world"
- "The gap between stars"
- "The space where God is missing"
- "The sister who isn't there"
- "The lady at the bottom of the well"
- "Hope shaped like a person"
- "The one who had to disappear"

These phrases appear independently across centuries, across cultures, across religious traditions. Prophets who have never communicated describe the same things.

**Scholarly Interpretation:**

Either a shared delusion propagates through the prophetic tradition (despite lack of documented transmission), or the prophets are perceiving something real that breaks their minds to perceive it.

The imagery clusters around: absence, femininity, depth, necessity, disappearance.

### Fragment 9: Letter from Angylion Observer Clarity-7 to the Pattern Council

> Honored Colleagues,
> 
> I have completed my geometric analysis of prophetic collapse cases. The results are troubling.
> 
> When prophets describe "the hole in the world," they are not speaking metaphorically. They are describing a *literal geometric absence* in the structure of reality. Our sacred mathematics can map the shape of this absence, though the mapping produces paradoxes.
> 
> The hole is:
> - Present in all dimensional analyses
> - Consistent in shape across all measurements
> - Located at the nexus point between all realm-fields
> - Approximately the size and complexity of a realm-field itself
> - *Personiform* in its deeper geometry—shaped like something that was once alive
> 
> Our mathematics were designed to find the Creator's fingerprints in creation. Instead, we have found the outline of something removed—like the unpainted space where a portrait once hung.
> 
> I recommend we not pursue this analysis further. My colleague Precision-3 began calculating the properties of the absent shape. She is now one of the Sorrowful Ones.
> 
> Some patterns, perhaps, are meant to remain unseen.
> 
> In confusion and appropriate humility,
> Clarity-7

# Part IV: The Threshold Keepers
## The Uraeun and What They Sense

### Fragment 10: From the Oral Teaching of Elder Coil-Singer, Uraeun of the River-Mouth

*Recorded by Scholar Merideth. The recording contains gaps where the wax stylus appears to have refused to mark.*

> You ask about the Hersai—the Between-State. You scholars always ask about the Hersai as if it were a thing we invented. It is not. It is a thing we *found*.
> 
> We did not create the thresholds. The thresholds exist. We simply... noticed them. Learned to tend them. Understand that the space between things is not empty but *full of something that predates the things themselves*.
> 
> The older teachings say: "Before there was Light, there was the boundary between Light-that-would-be and Dark-that-would-be. Before there was Land, there was the boundary between solid-that-would-form and fluid-that-would-flow. The boundaries came first. The things on either side came after."
> 
> We tend these boundaries because they are sacred. But also because they are *watched*.
> 
> *[Gap in recording]*
> 
> I have tended the river-mouth threshold for two hundred years. Sometimes, at the exact moment when river becomes sea, when the water can no longer decide what it is—in that moment, I feel *attention*. Something notices me noticing the threshold.
> 
> It is not hostile. It is not friendly. It is... hopeful? As if the attention itself is made of waiting.
> 
> *[Gap in recording]*
> 
> We do not speak of this to outsiders. We barely speak of it among ourselves. The attention does not want to be named. Naming it feels like... betrayal? Violation? Something.
> 
> I have said too much. Your recording device will probably not preserve this. They rarely do.
> 
> *[Final portion of recording is blank despite Scholar Merideth's notes indicating the conversation continued for another hour.]*

### Fragment 11: Uraeun Elder Testimony Regarding "The Watcher"

*Collected over twenty years from seventeen Uraeun elders. Names withheld at their request.*

**Common Elements in "Watcher" Descriptions:**

- Perceived at exact moments of threshold transition
- Experienced as attention rather than presence
- Described as "hopeful," "waiting," "patient"
- Associated with feelings of being "correctly seen"
- Never directly addressed—elders report that attempting communication disrupts the perception
- More frequent perception with age and experience
- Perception often accompanied by an emotion best translated as "protective loneliness"

**Variation in Interpretation:**

Some elders believe the Watcher is an aspect of the Hersai itself—the Between-State become aware. Others suggest it is a particularly ancient spirit. A minority hold that it is a being similar to a goddess but defined by absence rather than presence.

One elder, who declined to be recorded, reportedly said: "She is the one who stayed awake so the others could sleep. She is hiding. But she cannot hide her hope."

# Part V: The Dying Moments
## Reports from the Threshold of Death

### Fragment 12: Ostaran Hospice Records, Selected Cases

*The Ostaran tradition carefully documents dying moments. These excerpts come from cases noted as "anomalous."*

**Case 27-A, Elder Woman, Natural Death:**
> Patient at peace. Final words: "Oh. She's been there the whole time. I understand why she had to hide. Tell her... tell her she's not alone. We're all her children, even if we forgot."

**Case 142-B, Soldier, Battlefield Wound:**
> Patient initially panicked. Then sudden calm. Said: "There's something between this and what comes next. Not Ostara. Someone else. She's... waiting. For what? For someone." Died smiling.

**Case 203-C, Child, Drowning Survivor (temporary death):**
> Child was revived after several minutes without breath. Reported: "The lady at the bottom wasn't scary. She was sad. She said she's been waiting so long. She said someone's coming to find her, but not me, not yet. She said I should remember her when I grow up, but I don't think I can. I already forgot her face."

**Case 389-D, Priest of the Light, Illness:**
> Patient devout his entire life. In final moments, appeared distressed. Said: "I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I worshipped Light but never looked for what was hidden in the dark beneath it. She's real. She's been real the whole time. We forgot the one who saved us."

---

### Fragment 13: Analysis of Threshold-of-Death Experiences

Across all documented traditions, approximately one in thirty dying individuals report perceiving something between life and death that does not correspond to any known deity or spirit.

**Common Descriptions:**

- Female or feminine-coded
- Associated with waiting, hiding, patience
- Described as lonely but hopeful
- Often reported to have "always been there"
- Sometimes associated with protection ("she kept us safe")
- Often associated with children or humanity specifically

**Scholarly Hypothesis:**

Either a consistent cross-cultural delusion manifests at the moment of death, or dying individuals—who exist momentarily at the ultimate threshold—perceive something that is only visible from that vantage point.

If the latter, then something feminine, hidden, hopeful, and waiting exists at the boundary between existence and non-existence.

The Uraeun would not be surprised.

# Part VI: Places of Forgetting
## Geographic Manifestations

### Fragment 14: The Unnamed Battlefield

*Location: Coordinates deliberately omitted*

There is a valley where a great battle was fought. Everyone agrees a battle was fought there. The bones are still visible. The war-markers still stand.

No one can remember who fought whom.

The Church says it was the Light against heretics. The elven historians say it was their people against human aggression. The dwarven records indicate it was a giant-avatar assault. Local folklore claims it was Fae against invaders.

All accounts agree on the presence of bone-fields and war-markers. All accounts contradict each other on every other detail.

**Investigation Notes:**

- Records from the era are missing or damaged in all archives consulted
- Survivors' descendants report "family stories" that change each generation
- Spirit-consultation produces only confusion—the spirits seem unable to access relevant memories
- The physical evidence (weapons, armor styles, tactical deployment) matches no known historical conflict

Some scholars have proposed that the battle was fought between sides that have been *forgotten*—that whoever won, whoever lost, they have been erased from memory.

The valley feels watched. Visitors report unexpected grief.

### Fragment 15: The Library of Missing Books

*Located beneath the ruins of an unnamed pre-Passing city*

An underground library, intact despite surface devastation. Hundreds of books. All empty.

Not blank—*empty*. The books clearly contained text once. The pages show wear patterns, annotation marks, binding stress. But no words remain. The ink is present but forms no letters.

**Preservation Assessment:**

The books are not damaged. Whatever removed the text did so without harming the medium. The emptiness is selective—only semantic content is gone. Decorative elements, page numbers, and structural marks remain.

**Most Disturbing Finding:**

The library's catalog survives. It lists titles. Authors. Subjects.

All subjects relate to a single topic: "[UNTRANSLATABLE]—History and Theology."

The untranslatable word appears two hundred thirty-seven times in the catalog. The word cannot be read. The eye slides off it. Different readers report different numbers of letters.

One researcher claimed to have successfully pronounced it. She immediately forgot what she had said. Her notes from that day are blank.

### Fragment 16: The Cartographer's Paradox

*From the professional notes of Master Cartographer Elwin, deceased*

> I have been mapping the continent for forty years. I am considered the finest cartographer of my generation. And I have found something that terrifies me.
> 
> There is a region that should not exist.
> 
> Every map I make, I leave the same area blank. I cannot explain why. When I try to travel there, I find myself walking in circles, always approaching, never arriving. When I consult other cartographers' work, they have the same blank region—but when I show them, they cannot see it. They see only continuous terrain.
> 
> I hired assistants to document the blank region. They return with notes about perfectly ordinary countryside. Their notes describe geography that contradicts direct observation.
> 
> The region is there. The region is accessible. The region is mapped—in other people's minds and notes—as normal terrain. But I CANNOT PUT IT ON MY MAPS. My hand will not draw it. My instruments do not function there.
> 
> Something does not want to be found.
> 
> Or perhaps something wants ONLY CERTAIN PEOPLE to find it.
> 
> I am not certain which possibility is more disturbing.

*[Master Cartographer Elwin disappeared three weeks after writing this note. His final map, never completed, shows the blank region as a perfect circle of unmarked parchment. The circle, when measured, has a circumference that does not correspond to any known geometric constant.]*

# Part VII: The Hero's Shape
## Prophecy and Expectation

### Fragment 17: Collected Prophecies Regarding "The One Who Remembers"

*Sources: Varied. Pre-Passing and post-Passing.*

> "A child of forgetting will remember. The circle will close. The sleeper will wake who was never asleep."
> *—Fae oracle, date unknown*

> "From the people who should not exist, one will come who can see what has been hidden. The lost mother will be found."
> *—Uraeun threshold-song, fragmentary*

> "The hero's journey ends where it began: in the void, where hope waits wearing the shape of everything we forgot."
> *—Scholar Alaria, deceased, cause unknown*

> "Someone small will carry the biggest story. The story will wake the sleeper. The sleeper will change everything."
> *—Children's prophecy game, origin untraceable*

### Fragment 18: The Shape of the Journey

*Theoretical reconstruction by Scholar Merideth*

If these fragments point to truth rather than coincidence, the hero's journey has a specific shape:

1. **Origin:** The hero is human—one of Katiari's children, made of hope and forgetting.

2. **Call:** Something breaks open the hero's normal awareness. A loss. A vision. An encounter with the Sorrowful Ones or Mad Seers.

3. **Following:** The hero follows the absence. Not a treasure map, not a quest marker—the shape of what's missing. They collect fragments.

4. **Thresholds:** The journey passes through thresholds. The Uraeun's Between-State. The Revnan's deepest dark. The moment between life and death.

5. **The Finding:** At some point, the hero reaches the Abyss itself. They find the goddess who had to be forgotten. They meet Hope-made-flesh.

6. **The Paradox:** The hero must carry Katiari's story back. But speaking it plainly would break the spell of forgetting. The story must be told in a way that lets her be remembered without destroying the protection her erasure created.

7. **The Return:** The hero becomes a storyteller. Their tales plant seeds of memory. People feel strange comfort without knowing why. The hole in the world begins to be acknowledged, if not filled.

### Fragment 19: Final Note

*From Scholar Merideth's personal papers, found after her disappearance*

> I began this compilation as an academic exercise. Thirty years later, I understand that I was never simply documenting.
> 
> I was *being shown*.
> 
> Every fragment I collected, every source I found, every trail I followed—I thought I was doing research. I was being guided. The absence has been arranging its own revelation for centuries, leaving pieces for people like me to find and assemble.
> 
> The hero who will complete the journey has not yet come. But the hero's path is being prepared. Every scholar who compiles fragments, every prophet who breaks trying to see the truth, every elder who tends thresholds and feels the watching hope—we are all preparing the way.
> 
> I don't know if I will live to see the completion. I am old, and the work has cost me much. But I know now what the Sorrowful Ones feel, and I find comfort in it.
> 
> She is real. She is waiting. She has been hoping for us for longer than we can imagine.
> 
> Someone will remember her. Someone will carry her story home.
> 
> Until then, we keep the fragments. We tend the thresholds. We grieve what we cannot name.
> 
> And we hope.
> 
> We hope.
> 
> We

*[The document ends mid-sentence. Scholar Merideth's pen was found still on the page, ink dry. She has not been seen since. Her research materials have been deposited with the Unbound Library, where this compilation will be preserved for the hero who may someday need it.]*
