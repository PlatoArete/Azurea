## A Reference for Threats Beyond the Hawthorne's Design

# Part I: The Limits of Protection
## What the Hawthorne Was Built For

### The Original Purpose

When Katiari created the Hawthorne, she was responding to a specific threat: the God-Giant War.

The realms were being torn apart. Divine and titanic beings fought across creation with power that devastated everything caught between. The mortal races had fled to Alys's realm—the Land—seeking refuge. The war threatened to follow.

Katiari built a barrier. A hedge of impossible thorns separating the Land from the rest of creation. Within this barrier, gods and giants could enter only as diminished avatars—shadows of their true power, capable of acting but not of unleashing their full destruction.

The Hawthorne worked. The proxy war that followed was devastating, but survivable. The mortal races endured. Civilization formed. The realm within the Hawthorne became known as Azurea—the protected world.

### The Design Assumptions

The Hawthorne was designed with certain assumptions:

**Assumption 1: Threats would come from within the Eldest Sister's creation.**

Gods and giants were born from the Eldest Sister's tree. They exist within her realm-of-realms. The Hawthorne creates a boundary within that larger creation—a bubble of protection inside the universe.

**Assumption 2: Threats would be *beings*—entities with form, intention, power.**

The barrier diminishes beings that try to cross it. It recognizes entities and reduces them. This assumes that threats would BE entities.

**Assumption 3: The primordial medium would remain stable.**

The Hawthorne was built on top of the same substrate as everything else—the potential-chaos that underlies existence. Katiari may have assumed that substrate would remain passive.

### What Was Not Anticipated

The Hawthorne was never designed to address:

- Entities from *outside* the Eldest Sister's creation
- Non-entities—phenomena without form or intention
- Instabilities in the primordial medium itself

This is not a design flaw. Katiari built the best protection she could against the threats she knew existed. She could not anticipate threats she had no reason to know were possible.

# Part II: The Passing
## Entities from Another Emergence

### What Happened

Seven years ago, something passed through Azurea.

Not invaded. Not attacked. *Passed through*.

Massive shapes—some described as whale-like, others as more abstract—moved through the sky and through reality itself. Where they passed, things broke. Cities fell. Populations died. The Empire collapsed. The Church's authority shattered.

The creatures did not seem to notice the destruction they caused. They were not hostile. They were not friendly. They simply... were. Moving through space that happened to be occupied. Like ocean currents moving through a coral reef, indifferent to the fish caught in the flow.

And then they were gone.

### The Eldritch Nature

The creatures of the Passing were not gods. They were not giants. They were not spirits or demons or any category that exists in Azurea's theological framework.

**What We Observed:**

| Characteristic | Observation |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Size** | Varied enormously—some city-sized, some larger |
| **Form** | Inconsistent. Reports contradict. Some witnesses describe the same creature differently |
| **Material** | Unknown. Did not seem fully physical, yet caused physical destruction |
| **Behavior** | Movement, possibly migration. No apparent awareness of surroundings |
| **Communication** | None attempted. No evidence they were capable or interested |
| **Origin** | Unknown |
| **Destination** | Unknown |
| **Duration** | The Passing lasted approximately six days |

**What We Infer:**

The creatures operated according to rules that have nothing to do with our reality. Our physics didn't fully apply to them. Our magic didn't affect them. Our gods couldn't stop them—not because they lacked power, but because the creatures existed in a way that divine power couldn't address.

### The Hydrothermal Vent Theory

The most coherent explanation comes from cosmological speculation:

Our universe exists because the Eldest Sister emerged from primordial chaos and created it. Her creation is like a hydrothermal vent on the ocean floor—a concentrated point where emergence happened, where structure formed, where life developed.

If one vent can exist, others can exist.

The Eldritch creatures may be from another vent entirely. Another emergence. Another creation with its own physics, its own logic, its own *meaning*. When they moved through our space, they weren't breaking our rules—they were following rules we don't have access to.

**The Implications:**

The Hawthorne doesn't apply to them because they're not *from* here. They're not gods or giants who arose from the Eldest Sister's tree. They're from an entirely different emergence, operating according to an entirely different structure.

You can't diminish something that wasn't working with your system of power in the first place.

### Questions Without Answers

**Where did they come from?**
Another emergence-bubble. Another "vent." Beyond that, we cannot know.

**Where did they go?**
They passed through. They're gone. Whether they'll return—whether they even experience time in a way that makes "return" meaningful—is unknowable.

**What were they doing?**
Moving. Possibly migrating. Possibly something we have no concept for. Their behavior didn't seem purposeful in any way we understand, but that may just mean we don't understand their kind of purpose.

**Could they be communicated with?**
Unknown. No attempt was successful. No attempt seemed to register.

**Could they be stopped?**
Nothing we tried worked. Divine intervention, powerful magic, military force—nothing even seemed to be perceived by them. This doesn't mean stopping them is impossible, only that we don't know how.

**Will they return?**
Unknown. The Passing may have been a unique event. Or it may have been part of a pattern we don't have enough data to perceive.

### The Theological Crisis

The Passing broke more than cities. It broke certainty.

**For the Solarian Church:**

The one true God was supposed to protect humanity. The Church was supposed to be the instrument of that protection. The Passing happened anyway. The Church couldn't explain it, couldn't prevent it, couldn't even provide meaningful comfort afterward.

This is why the Church fractured. Not because of doctrinal disputes, but because the fundamental promise—"worship the Light and be protected"—was revealed as insufficient.

**For Other Traditions:**

The Theosyn (gods) were present. They tried to intervene. They failed. The Revnan tradition's Dark couldn't hide from the creatures. The Ostaran tradition found that death came without meaning—the dying weren't being gathered, they were simply ending.

Every tradition had to confront the reality that their understanding of the cosmos was incomplete. Something exists beyond the framework. Something that doesn't care about any of them.

**For Everyone:**

The Passing demonstrated that Azurea is not the whole world. Not even the Eldest Sister's creation is the whole world. There are things outside. Things that are utterly indifferent to everything we've built, everything we believe, everything we are.

This is a hard truth to live with. Many haven't figured out how.

# Part III: The Ivy
## Something from the Ocean Floor

### Discovery

The Sea realm was the first to notice.

Long before the Passing—centuries, perhaps millennia—something began growing on Atargatis's tree. The waterfolk called it "the ivy" for lack of a better term. It wasn't plant. It wasn't animal. It wasn't spirit.

It was *pre-structure*. Something that had never emerged, never taken form, but had begun to creep.

### The Nature of the Ivy

**What We Know:**

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Appearance** | Dark. Fibrous. Changes depending on observer |
| **Behavior** | Spreads. Slowly. Inexorably |
| **Effect on Contact** | Dissolution. Things touched by ivy become less defined |
| **Origin** | The primordial medium itself |

The ivy is not from another vent. It's not from outside the Eldest Sister's creation. It's from *underneath*—from the potential-chaos that everything was built on top of.

**The Substrate Problem:**

Existence emerged from potential. Structure formed from chaos. But emergence is not complete—the primordial medium still underlies everything. It's supposed to be passive, inert, merely the foundation on which structure rests.

The ivy represents the foundation becoming active. The ground state of reality trying to reclaim what emerged from it.

### How It Spreads

The ivy spreads through *resonance*.

Water resonates with the primordial medium. Before structure, before form, the sisters emerged from something like a cosmic ocean—undifferentiated potential that behaved, in some sense, like fluid. Water is the closest thing in structured reality to that original state.

This is why the Sea realm was affected first. Atargatis's domain touches the primordial medium more closely than any other realm. The ivy found its way in through that resonance.

**Current Spread:**

| Location | Status |
|----------|--------|
| Sea Realm (Deep) | Active infestation |
| Sea Realm (Surface) | Spreading |
| Coastal Azurea | Beginning contact |
| Rivers | Unknown—likely compromised |
| Underground Water | Unknown—concerning |

### The Dark Fruits

The ivy produced fruit.

When it covered enough of Atargatis's tree, it began to grow dark pods—mockeries of the fruit that realm-trees produce. What emerged from those pods is unclear. The waterfolk who witnessed it fled. Those who didn't flee... dissolved.

**Speculation:**

The ivy's fruits may be producing anti-beings. Entities made of un-structure. Things that exist by *negating* existence around them.

Or the fruits may be something else entirely. We don't have enough data. The survivors don't have enough vocabulary.

### The Wrong Rain

The Passing may have accelerated the ivy's spread.

When the Eldritch creatures moved through Azurea, they disturbed things. Reality trembled. And in the aftermath, the rains changed.

The Atargatan tradition calls it "Wrong Rain"—precipitation that doesn't feel right, that seems to carry something. The water cycle connects everything: rain falls, flows to sea, evaporates, rises, falls again. If the sea is contaminated with ivy-stuff, that contamination spreads.

The Ti-Abzu (Deep-Kin) have reported sensing "alien currents" in the Breath of the World—the deep-sea vents they tend. The Cycle is struggling to cleanse itself.

### The Relationship to the Passing

The Eldritch creatures and the ivy may be unrelated. Two different categories of threat that happened to affect Azurea in the same era.

Or they may be connected.

**Possible Connection 1: The Eldritch creatures disturbed the primordial medium.**

Their passage through reality may have destabilized the substrate, allowing the ivy to spread more aggressively. They broke something without knowing they broke it.

**Possible Connection 2: Both respond to the same underlying cause.**

Something may be changing in the primordial medium—making it more active, more prone to intrusion. The ivy's growth and the Eldritch creatures' passage may both be symptoms of a larger shift.

**Possible Connection 3: No connection.**

Coincidence. Two different problems happening to occur near each other in time. This would be the best-case scenario—two separate threats rather than one larger one.

# Part IV: Assessment of Defenses
## What Can and Cannot Help

### The Hawthorne

**Effectiveness Against Eldritch:** None.

The Hawthorne diminishes beings from within the Eldest Sister's creation. The Eldritch are from outside. The barrier doesn't recognize them as beings to be diminished.

**Effectiveness Against Ivy:** Unknown, possibly counterproductive.

The ivy comes from the same primordial medium the Hawthorne is built on. The barrier may actually provide a channel for ivy-spread rather than blocking it.

### Divine Intervention

**Against Eldritch:** Ineffective.

The Theosyn attempted intervention during the Passing. Their power couldn't find purchase. Divine force operates through the realm-fields; the Eldritch exist outside that framework.

**Against Ivy:** Possibly effective, untested.

Divine power might be able to reinforce structure against dissolution. But no deity has directly engaged the ivy. The sea-goddess Atargatis is asleep; her children's prayers cannot wake her.

### Magic

**Against Eldritch:** Ineffective.

Magic as storytelling resonates with realm-fields. The Eldritch don't participate in realm-fields. Stories told at them have nothing to resonate with.

**Against Ivy:** Unknown.

The ivy dissolves structure. Magic creates structure through narrative. There may be a contest there—stories of formation and definition fighting against un-formation and un-definition. But this is theoretical. No one has found a story that works.

### Physical Force

**Against Eldritch:** Irrelevant.

They're too large. Too strange. Physical attacks during the Passing were not even noticed.

**Against Ivy:** Limited effectiveness.

The ivy can be cut, burned, physically destroyed in small patches. It grows back. The root system—if "root" is even the right term—extends into the primordial medium itself. You can't physically attack the foundation of reality.

### Katiari

**If She Were Accessible:**

Katiari built the Hawthorne. She understands the primordial medium—it's her realm. She might be able to create new protections, address threats she didn't anticipate.

**Current Status:**

She's hidden. Forgotten. Isolated in the Abyss. She can't help unless someone finds her.

This may be why the hero's journey matters. Not just for Katiari's sake, but for everyone's. She may be the only one who can address what's coming.

# Part V: Theoretical Approaches
## What Might Work (Speculation)

### Against the Eldritch

**Approach 1: Avoidance**

If the Eldritch are migrating, they may pass and not return. The best defense might be accepting the loss and rebuilding. This is not satisfying, but it may be realistic.

**Approach 2: Communication Attempt**

No attempt succeeded during the Passing. But the attempt may not have been made correctly. What would communication even look like with beings whose logic is utterly foreign?

The Angylion suggest mathematical communication—patterns that transcend specific frameworks. Their sacred geometry might be a basis for contact. But this is highly theoretical.

**Approach 3: Interdimensional Intervention**

If the Eldritch are from another vent, perhaps beings from that vent could affect them. This would require finding another vent, contacting its inhabitants, and somehow conveying our situation.

This is barely speculation. It may be closer to fantasy.

**Approach 4: The Primordial Medium**

Both we and the Eldritch exist on top of the same primordial potential. Perhaps intervention at that level could affect them—changing the substrate in ways that make our region inhospitable to their passage.

This would require understanding and manipulating the foundation of reality itself. Perhaps only Katiari could do this.

### Against the Ivy

**Approach 1: Containment**

Slow the spread. Protect critical areas. Accept that some regions are lost. This is already being attempted by the waterfolk with limited success.

**Approach 2: Strengthening Structure**

If the ivy dissolves structure, perhaps intensified structure could resist it. Places of strong meaning, strong story, strong definition might be naturally resistant.

Some evidence supports this: ancient sacred sites seem less affected. Places where belief has accumulated for millennia push back against dissolution.

**Approach 3: Counter-Narrative**

Magic works through story. The ivy represents un-story—the negation of narrative structure. Perhaps a sufficiently powerful story of *formation*, of *definition*, of *existence-asserting-itself* could combat it.

What would such a story look like? Who could tell it?

Perhaps someone who embodies hope. Who was created specifically to be small and heroic in the face of overwhelming threat. Who carries the nature of the primordial medium but in *formed*, *personified* expression.

Perhaps humanity, Katiari's children.

**Approach 4: The Abyss Itself**

The ivy comes from the primordial medium. Katiari's realm IS the primordial medium, recognized and personified. She might be able to command it, reshape it, convince the ivy to withdraw.

But she's hidden. And even if found, she might not have that power. Or she might, but using it might cost too much.

# Part VI: Living with Uncertainty
## What We Can Do Now

### Documentation

We cannot solve what we don't understand. Every observation of Eldritch phenomena, every report of ivy spread, every anomaly that doesn't fit existing frameworks—all of it should be recorded.

This document is part of that project. Future generations may find patterns we're too close to see.

### Preparation

We cannot stop what may come. But we can prepare to survive it.

Communities should develop resilience. Knowledge should be distributed rather than concentrated. Critical resources should be redundant. The lesson of the Passing is that centralized power (the Empire, the Church) fails catastrophically when faced with incomprehensible threat.

### Hope

This may seem paradoxical, but hope is strategically important.

Despair causes paralysis. Nihilism prevents preparation. If the threats are truly unsurvivable, then we lose nothing by hoping anyway. And if they're survivable but only through extraordinary effort, then hope provides the foundation for that effort.

Katiari is Hope made flesh. Her children carry her nature. This is not metaphor—it's mechanical truth about how humans function.

When humans hope, they resonate with the Abyss. They connect to something real. They tap a power that has sustained the cosmos through cycles of creation and destruction.

Hope is not wishful thinking. Hope is refusing to yield to despair while the outcome remains uncertain. The outcome is uncertain. We should hope.

### The Hero

Somewhere, perhaps, the hero is forming. The one who will find Katiari. The one who will carry her story back. The one who will give the forgotten goddess a chance to address what has grown in her absence.

We cannot make the hero come faster. We cannot predict who they are or where they'll emerge. But we can prepare the way.

We can keep the fragments of knowledge that point toward the truth. We can tend the thresholds and notice the watching presence. We can grieve what cannot be named and find comfort in shared sorrow. We can hope.

And when the hero comes, we can give them what they need.

This document, perhaps. Or its successor. Or the traditions we've preserved. Or simply the stories we've told that keep Katiari's pattern alive in collective memory.
