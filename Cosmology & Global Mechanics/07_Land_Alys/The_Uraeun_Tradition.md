# The Uraeun Tradition: Keepers of the Between

## The Sacred Threshold
**Philosophy:** worship of the *Hersai* (Between-State).
**Role:** Guardians of passage (birth, death, dawn, doors).
**Principles:**
1.  Transformation as Devotion.
2.  The Threshold Creates.
3.  Binding and Joining.
4.  Hidden Nourishment.
5.  Renewal Through Release.

## Sacred Geometry
- **The Coil (Mehgam):** Protection, containment, the spiral.
- **The Line (Hettang):** Connection, the ley-line.

## Practices
- **The Wehsae (Shedding):** Ritual release of skin/self/possessions.
- **Hettang-Singing:** Emotional communication through ley-lines.
- **Threshold-Tending:** Daily maintenance of physical/spiritual doorways.

## The Post-Passing Crisis
The ley-lines were damaged; the Hettang is quieter. Uraeun are repairing the "Net of the Between."
