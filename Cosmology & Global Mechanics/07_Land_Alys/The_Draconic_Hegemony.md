# The Draconic Hegemony: Faith of the Deep Fire

## Origins
**The First Tree:** Dragons, Giants, and Gods share a primordial origin.
**The Migration:** Dragons left the origin-realm to avoid the God-Giant war (The Sundering).
**The Pact:** Katiari raised the Hawthorne. Dragons agreed to be partially bound to separate younger races from the Sundering.

## Theology: The Deep Fire
**The Sleeping Ones:** The ancestors dream in the earth's core.
**Inner Fire:** Dragon-kin generate their own heat (spiritual and physical).
**Philosophy:** True rule is knowing when to step back (as the Sleeping Ones did).

## The Three Houses
1.  **Lóng-Imperiales:** Administrators. "Order is Supreme Harmony."
2.  **Tiān-Phanes:** Philosophers/Alchemists. "All flows."
3.  **Mush-Nāga:** Priest-Kings/Earth-Binders. "The Earth Remembers."

## Structure
**Consilium Draconis:** Triarchic council.
**Trial of the Pearl:** Decision making (Mush-Nāga present, Tiān-Phanes refine, Lóng-Imperiales set).

## Liturgy
- **Waking Vigil:** Listening for the Sleeping Ones.
- **Flame Renewal:** Relighting fires from Deep Vents.
