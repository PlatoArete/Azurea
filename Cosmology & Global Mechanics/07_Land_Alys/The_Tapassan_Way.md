# The Tapassan Way: Faith of the Received Sun

## Core Theology
**The Received Sun:** Not worshiped as a distant god, but received as a vital force.
**Tapas:** The transformative warmth. The gift becomes the receiver.
**Relationship:** The Sun gives, the Kin receive, the Kin shine (act).

## The Four Truths
1.  **The Sun Gives Without Condition.**
2.  **Receiving is Sacred Action.**
3.  **Transformation is the Purpose.**
4.  **We Are Meant to Shine.**

## Practices
- **Basking:** The central sacrament. Active reception.
- **Sun-Greeting:** Dawn ritual.
- **Warm Stones:** Sacred objects that hold the gift.
- **Fire-Tending:** Fire as "Secondary Sun."

## Relations
**"Younger Siblings":** To Dragons (who generate heat). Tapassans respect them but maintain their own path of Reception.
**Croc-Kin Duality:** Syncretism with Atargatan (Sun + Water).
