# The Alysian Tradition: Ways of the Living Land

## Core Principles
1.  The Land Is Alive.
2.  Spirits Are Everywhere.
3.  Relationship Requires Reciprocity.
4.  Place Matters.
5.  The Old Ways Endure.

## The Wheel of the Year
The cycle of seasons governs all.
- **Awakening Night (Spring):** Waking the land.
- **Seed Balance (Equinox):** Planting, fertility.
- **Green Fire (Late Spring):** Explosion of life.
- **High Sun (Solstice):** Peak light, Fae activity.
- **First Fruit (Late Summer):** First harvest.
- **Harvest Balance (Equinox):** Main harvest, preparation.
- **Spirit Night (Late Autumn):** Veil thins, ancestors return.
- **Deep Night (Solstice):** Longest night, vigil for the sun.

## Practices
- **Offerings:** "I do not take; I receive." Always leave something back.
- **Asking Permission:** Before cutting trees or harvesting wild things.
- **Hospitality:** To strangers (who might be Fae) and spirits.

## The Post-Passing Crisis
The Land was wounded by the mere presence of the passing creatures.
- **Trauma:** Silent forests, dead trees, hostile spirits.
- **Recovery:** Slow healing in some places; transformation in others.
- **Crisis:** "Why didn't the spirits protect us?"
