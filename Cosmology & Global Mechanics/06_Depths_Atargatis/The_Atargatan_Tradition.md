# The Atargatan Tradition: Faith of the Flowing Way

## The Eight Principles
1. Flow and Yielding.
2. Surface Tranquility, Hidden Depths.
3. Power Without Force.
4. Slow Transformation.
5. Receiving of All Things.
6. The Endless Cycle.
7. Purification Through Immersion.
8. The Wisdom of Pressure.

## Practices
**Purification:**
- **Dawn/Dusk Washing:** Daily ritual.
- **Immersion:** Sea bathing for major cleansing.
- **River Bathing:** Carrying corruption away.

**Architecture:**
- **Tidal Temples:** Half-submerged breathing structures.
- **Vent-Temples:** Grown deep-sea coral structures.
- **Thermocline Temples:** Meeting points between surface and deep.

## The Post-Passing Crisis
The Sea is polluted by "Wrong Rain." The Cycle is struggling to cleanse it.
- **Surface:** Sick waters, disrupted trade.
- **Deep:** Ti-Abzu sensing alien currents.
- **The Debate:** Seek help from the Land/Underworld, or trust the Cycle?
