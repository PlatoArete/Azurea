# Realm Overview: Depths (Atargatis)

## The Nature of Atargatis: The Flowing Way

Atargatis is **Flow**—the principle of yielding that overcomes resistance.
**Nature:** Surface (Shimmering) and Repths (Abiding).
**Philosophy:** Wu Wei (Accomplish through yielding).

**The Cycle:** Rain -> River -> Sea -> Cloud. Eternal return.

## The Two Faces
1.  **Surface-Face:** Light, movement, purification, trade.
2.  **Depths-Face:** Darkness, pressure, stillness, transformation.

## Theological Connections
**The Thermocline:** The boundary between worlds.
**Connection to Death:** The Deep Ocean touches the Underworld (Ostara). Shared pressure/depth themes.
**Connection to Peaks:** Twin sisters. One stores power in height/stone, the other in depth/weight.

## The Crisis
The Sea received the metaphysical pollution of the Passing (via rain). The Deep Peoples are concerned it cannot be cleansed.
