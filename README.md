# Azurea: The World of the Nine Fields

Welcome to the **Azurea** worldbuilding repository. This project documents a high-fantasy setting where cosmology, physics, and narrative magic intertwine.

## Core Premise

Azurea exists within a universe created by the **Eldest Sister**, one of a triad of primordial entities. The world is defined by the interaction of **Realm Fields**—fundamental forces that are both physical realities and metaphysical concepts.

### The Tripartite Origin
The sentient races of the cosmos share a common origin from the Eldest Sister's fruit:
1.  **The Gods (Theosyn):** Beings of mirror-nature, shaped by belief and light.
2.  **The Giants:** Beings of destruction and raw matter.
3.  **The Dragons:** Beings of deep fire who withdrew from conflict.

### The Realms
Nine realms, created by the younger sisters, permeate existence as quantum "fields." Mages influence reality by attuning to these fields through narrative resonance.

| Realm      | Domain             | Key Tradition                   |
| :--------- | :----------------- | :------------------------------ |

| **Peaks**  | Storm, Stone       | Axis Faith                      |
| **Depths** | Ocean, Flow        | Atargatan Tradition             |
| **Land**   | Nature, Seasons    | Alysian / Draconic              |
| **Abyss**  | Forgetting         | (Hidden)                        |
| **Azurea** | The Material World | The protected convergence point |

## Recent History: The Passing

The setting is currently in a "Post-Calamity" era known as **The Passing**.
An eldritch event shattered the established order, collapsing the Solarian Empire and proving the fallibility of the Church. The world is now in a state of fractured reconstruction, religious schism, and magical instability.
